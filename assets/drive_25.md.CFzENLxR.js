After rationalizing the denominator, express the simplified form of the ratio of their side lengths in the form frac{a sqrt{b}}{c} where a, b, and c are integers. Find the sum a+b+c.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here that says the ratio of the areas of two squares is 50 over 98. I need to find the ratio of their side lengths, simplify it, and then express it in the form a times the square root of b over c, where a, b, and c are integers. After that, I have to find the sum of a, b, and c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for squares, the area is equal to the side length squared. So if I have two squares with areas A1 and A2, their side lengths would be s1 and s2, right? And the ratio of their areas would be A1/A2, which is equal to (s1/s2) squared. So, if I take the square root of the area ratio, I should get the ratio of their side lengths.Alright, so the area ratio given is 50/98. Let me write that down: A1/A2 = 50/98. To find the ratio of the side lengths, s1/s2, I need to take the square root of 50/98. So, s1/s2 = sqrt(50/98). Now, I can simplify sqrt(50/98). Let me see, sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2), which is 5*sqrt(2). Similarly, sqrt(98) is sqrt(49*2), which is 7*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(50/98) becomes (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). Wait a second, I can cancel out the sqrt(2) in the numerator and the denominator. So, (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)) simplifies to 5/7. Hmm, that seems too simple. But wait, maybe I made a mistake because the problem mentions rationalizing the denominator. Did I skip a step?Let me go back. The ratio of the areas is 50/98, so the ratio of the side lengths is sqrt(50/98). Instead of simplifying sqrt(50) and sqrt(98) separately, maybe I should first simplify the fraction 50/98 before taking the square root. Let me try that.50 and 98 have a common factor. Let's see, 50 divided by 2 is 25, and 98 divided by 2 is 49. So, 50/98 simplifies to 25/49. So, sqrt(50/98) is the same as sqrt(25/49). Now, sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(49) is 7. So, sqrt(25/49) is 5/7. Wait, so that's the same result as before. So, the ratio of the side lengths is 5/7. But the problem says to express it in the form a*sqrt(b)/c after rationalizing the denominator. But 5/7 doesn't have a square root in it. Did I do something wrong?Let me double-check. Maybe I was supposed to rationalize the denominator even though it's already rational? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I misapplied the simplification step. Let me go back to the original ratio.Original area ratio: 50/98. So, s1/s2 = sqrt(50)/sqrt(98). sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2), and sqrt(98) is 7*sqrt(2). So, s1/s2 = (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). Then, I can cancel out the sqrt(2) terms, which gives me 5/7. But the problem wants the ratio in the form a*sqrt(b)/c. So, maybe I need to express it differently. Let me think. If I don't cancel out the sqrt(2), I have (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2). So, (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) = (5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)). Simplifying the numerator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 5*2 is 10. Denominator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 7*2 is 14. So, that gives me 10/14, which simplifies to 5/7. Hmm, so again, I end up with 5/7. But the problem specifies expressing it in the form a*sqrt(b)/c. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, maybe I shouldn't simplify the fraction 50/98 before taking the square root. Let's see: sqrt(50/98) can be written as sqrt(50)/sqrt(98). As I did earlier, sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2), and sqrt(98) is 7*sqrt(2). So, s1/s2 = (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). If I don't cancel out the sqrt(2), I can rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(2). So, (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)) * (sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) = (5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)). Simplifying numerator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 5*2 is 10. Denominator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 7*2 is 14. So, 10/14 simplifies to 5/7. Wait, so regardless of whether I simplify the fraction first or not, I end up with 5/7. But the problem wants it in the form a*sqrt(b)/c. Maybe I'm supposed to leave it in terms of sqrt(2) before rationalizing? Let me try that.So, starting again: s1/s2 = sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) = (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). If I don't cancel out the sqrt(2), I can write it as (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). Now, to rationalize the denominator, I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):(5*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) / (7*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) = (5*2) / (7*2) = 10/14 = 5/7.But again, that's just 5/7. So, maybe the problem expects me to express it as 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2) before rationalizing, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to present it in a form that includes a square root, even if it cancels out.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me check the initial step again. The area ratio is 50/98. So, s1/s2 = sqrt(50/98). Let's compute sqrt(50) and sqrt(98) separately.sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2) = 5*sqrt(2). sqrt(98) is sqrt(49*2) = 7*sqrt(2). So, s1/s2 = (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). Now, if I don't cancel the sqrt(2), I can write this as (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). To rationalize the denominator, I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):(5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = (5*2)/(7*2) = 10/14 = 5/7.So, again, I end up with 5/7. It seems that no matter how I approach it, the ratio of the side lengths simplifies to 5/7, which doesn't have a square root in it. But the problem specifically asks for the form a*sqrt(b)/c. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to rationalize the denominator before simplifying the fraction. Let me try that. So, starting with sqrt(50)/sqrt(98), which is (5*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)). If I rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(2), I get:(5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = (5*2)/(7*2) = 10/14 = 5/7.Still the same result. Hmm, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the square roots cancel out, leaving a simple fraction. So, in that case, the ratio of the side lengths is 5/7, which can be written as (5*sqrt(1))/7, since sqrt(1) is 1. But that seems a bit forced. Alternatively, maybe I should present it as (5*sqrt(2))/7*sqrt(2), but that's not simplified. Wait, no, because sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) is 1, so that's just 5/7.I'm a bit confused here. The problem says to express it in the form a*sqrt(b)/c after rationalizing the denominator. So, perhaps I need to present it as 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2), but that's not simplified. Alternatively, maybe I need to rationalize the denominator before simplifying the fraction.Wait, let's try that. So, starting with sqrt(50)/sqrt(98). Instead of simplifying sqrt(50) and sqrt(98), I can rationalize the denominator first. So, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(98):sqrt(50)*sqrt(98) / (sqrt(98)*sqrt(98)) = sqrt(50*98) / 98.Now, sqrt(50*98) is sqrt(4900), which is 70. So, 70/98 simplifies to 5/7. Again, same result. So, regardless of the approach, I end up with 5/7. Therefore, the ratio of the side lengths is 5/7, which can be expressed as (5*sqrt(1))/7, but that's not very meaningful. Alternatively, since 5/7 is already rational, maybe the problem expects me to present it as is, but in the form a*sqrt(b)/c, which would require b to be 1.But that seems odd. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem statement again: \\"After rationalizing the denominator, express the simplified form of the ratio of their side lengths in the form a sqrt(b)/c where a, b, and c are integers.\\" So, perhaps the key is that after rationalizing, it's in the form a*sqrt(b)/c, but in this case, the sqrt(b) is sqrt(1), which is 1, so it's just a/c. So, a=5, b=1, c=7, and the sum is 5+1+7=13. But wait, earlier I thought the answer was 14. Hmm.Wait, no, because when I rationalized, I ended up with 5/7, which is equivalent to 5*sqrt(1)/7. So, a=5, b=1, c=7. Therefore, the sum is 5+1+7=13. But in the initial solution, the assistant got 14 by considering a different approach. Maybe I need to revisit that.Wait, in the initial solution, the assistant did the following:sqrt(50/98) = sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) = 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2). Then, they multiplied numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) to get 5*sqrt(4)/7*sqrt(2) = 10/7*sqrt(2). Then, they rationalized again to get 10*sqrt(2)/14 = 5*sqrt(2)/7. So, in that case, a=5, b=2, c=7, sum is 14.But in my approach, I simplified the fraction first, getting 25/49, whose square root is 5/7, which is 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13.So, which approach is correct? The problem says to rationalize the denominator after taking the square root. So, perhaps the correct approach is to first take the square root of the area ratio, which is sqrt(50)/sqrt(98), and then rationalize the denominator.So, sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) = 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2). Then, to rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):(5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = (5*2)/(7*2) = 10/14 = 5/7.But that's the same as before. Alternatively, if I don't simplify sqrt(50) and sqrt(98) first, and instead rationalize sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(98):sqrt(50)*sqrt(98)/98 = sqrt(4900)/98 = 70/98 = 5/7.So, again, same result. Therefore, the ratio is 5/7, which can be written as 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13. But the initial solution got 14 by expressing it as 5*sqrt(2)/7.Wait, perhaps the initial solution made a mistake by not simplifying the fraction before taking the square root. Let me check:sqrt(50/98) = sqrt(25/49) = 5/7. So, that's correct. Alternatively, sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) = 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2) = 5/7. So, both methods lead to the same result.Therefore, the correct ratio is 5/7, which can be expressed as 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a=5, b=1, c=7, sum=13. But the initial solution got 14 by expressing it as 5*sqrt(2)/7, which is incorrect because that would imply a ratio of 5*sqrt(2)/7, which is not equal to 5/7.Wait, no, actually, 5*sqrt(2)/7 is not equal to 5/7. So, that must be a mistake. Therefore, the correct approach is to simplify the fraction first, leading to 5/7, which is 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13.But now I'm confused because the initial solution presented a different answer. Maybe I need to clarify.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio to be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), even though it cancels out. So, if I don't simplify the fraction first, and instead take sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) = 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2), and then rationalize by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(2), I get 5*sqrt(4)/7*sqrt(2) = 10/7*sqrt(2). Then, rationalizing again, I get 10*sqrt(2)/14 = 5*sqrt(2)/7.Wait, but that's incorrect because sqrt(4) is 2, so 5*sqrt(4) is 10, and 7*sqrt(2) remains. So, 10/(7*sqrt(2)) is the intermediate step, which then rationalizes to 10*sqrt(2)/14 = 5*sqrt(2)/7.But that's a different result from 5/7. So, which one is correct? Let me compute numerically.sqrt(50) is approximately 7.071, and sqrt(98) is approximately 9.899. So, 7.071/9.899 is approximately 0.714, which is 5/7 (since 5 divided by 7 is approximately 0.714). On the other hand, 5*sqrt(2)/7 is approximately 5*1.414/7 ≈ 7.07/7 ≈ 1.01, which is not equal to 0.714. So, clearly, 5*sqrt(2)/7 is incorrect.Therefore, the correct ratio is 5/7, which is approximately 0.714. So, the initial solution must have made a mistake by not simplifying the fraction first, leading to an incorrect expression.Therefore, the correct way is to simplify the area ratio first: 50/98 = 25/49. Then, take the square root: sqrt(25/49) = 5/7. So, the ratio of the side lengths is 5/7, which can be written as 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a=5, b=1, c=7, and the sum is 13.But wait, the problem says \\"after rationalizing the denominator,\\" so maybe I need to present it in a form where the denominator is rationalized, even if it's already rational. So, 5/7 is already rational, so no need to rationalize. Therefore, the form a*sqrt(b)/c would be 5*sqrt(1)/7, as I thought earlier.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to present it as 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2), but that's not simplified. So, I think the correct answer is 5/7, expressed as 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13.But now I'm second-guessing myself because the initial solution got 14. Maybe I need to check the problem again.Wait, the problem says: \\"After rationalizing the denominator, express the simplified form of the ratio of their side lengths in the form a sqrt(b)/c where a, b, and c are integers.\\"So, perhaps the key is to rationalize the denominator before simplifying the fraction. Let's try that.Starting with sqrt(50)/sqrt(98). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(98):sqrt(50)*sqrt(98) / (sqrt(98)*sqrt(98)) = sqrt(50*98)/98.Now, 50*98 = 4900, and sqrt(4900) is 70. So, 70/98 simplifies to 5/7.So, again, same result. Therefore, the ratio is 5/7, which can be expressed as 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13.Therefore, I think the initial solution made a mistake by not simplifying the fraction first, leading to an incorrect expression. The correct answer should be 5/7, expressed as 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13.But wait, the problem specifically mentions rationalizing the denominator. So, if I start with sqrt(50)/sqrt(98), and rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(98), I get sqrt(50*98)/98 = 70/98 = 5/7. So, that's rationalized, and the denominator is now rational.Therefore, the ratio is 5/7, which is already in the form a*sqrt(b)/c with b=1. So, a=5, b=1, c=7, sum=13.But the initial solution got 14 by expressing it as 5*sqrt(2)/7, which is incorrect because that would imply a different ratio. So, I think the correct answer is 13.Wait, but let me double-check the initial solution:\\"First, take the square root of the area ratio: sqrt(50/98) = sqrt(50)/sqrt(98) = 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2). Note that simplifying we get: 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 5*sqrt(4)/7*sqrt(2) = 10/7*sqrt(2). To rationalize the denominator, multiply by sqrt(2): 10/7*sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 10*sqrt(2)/14 = 5*sqrt(2)/7.\\"Wait, that seems incorrect because when they multiplied 5*sqrt(2)/7*sqrt(2) by sqrt(2)/sqrt(2), they should have gotten (5*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/(7*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = (5*2)/(7*2) = 10/14 = 5/7, not 5*sqrt(4)/7*sqrt(2). So, that step was wrong. They incorrectly wrote 5*sqrt(4) instead of 5*2.Therefore, the initial solution made a mistake in the calculation, leading to an incorrect expression. The correct ratio is 5/7, which is 5*sqrt(1)/7, giving a sum of 13.So, in conclusion, the correct answer is 13."},{"question":"Compute[left( 1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ} right) left( 1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ} right) left( 1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ} right) left( 1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ} right).]","answer":"Alright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It looks like a product of four terms, each involving trigonometric functions. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:[left( 1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ} right) left( 1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ} right) left( 1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ} right) left( 1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ} right)]Okay, so I need to compute this product. Hmm, trigonometric functions at specific angles. I remember that for common angles like 30°, 45°, and 60°, the sine and cosine values are known. Let me recall those:- (cos 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2})- (sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2})- (sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2})- (cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2})Alright, so I can substitute these values into the expression. Let me do that step by step.First term: (1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ})Substituting (cos 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}):[1 - frac{1}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} } = 1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}}]Hmm, that simplifies to (1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}}). Maybe I can rationalize the denominator:[1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = 1 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{3}{3} - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3}]Okay, so the first term simplifies to (frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3}).Second term: (1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ})Substituting (sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}):[1 + frac{1}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}}]Again, rationalizing the denominator:[1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = 1 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{3}{3} + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}]So the second term is (frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}).Third term: (1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ})Substituting (sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2}):[1 - frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 1 - 2 = -1]That was straightforward. The third term simplifies to (-1).Fourth term: (1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ})Substituting (cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2}):[1 + frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 1 + 2 = 3]So the fourth term is (3).Now, putting it all together, the original expression becomes:[left( frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3} right) times left( frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3} right) times (-1) times 3]Let me compute this step by step.First, multiply the first two terms:[left( frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3} right) times left( frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3} right)]This looks like a difference of squares: ((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2). Let me apply that:[frac{(3)^2 - (2sqrt{3})^2}{3 times 3} = frac{9 - 4 times 3}{9} = frac{9 - 12}{9} = frac{-3}{9} = -frac{1}{3}]Okay, so the product of the first two terms is (-frac{1}{3}).Now, multiply this by the third term, which is (-1):[-frac{1}{3} times (-1) = frac{1}{3}]Next, multiply this result by the fourth term, which is (3):[frac{1}{3} times 3 = 1]Wait, that seems too simple. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my steps.First, the first term:[1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ} = 1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3}]That looks correct.Second term:[1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ} = 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}]Also correct.Third term:[1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ} = 1 - 2 = -1]Yes.Fourth term:[1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ} = 1 + 2 = 3]Correct.Multiplying the first two terms:[left( frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3} right) times left( frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3} right) = frac{(3)^2 - (2sqrt{3})^2}{9} = frac{9 - 12}{9} = -frac{3}{9} = -frac{1}{3}]That's correct.Then, multiplying by (-1):[-frac{1}{3} times (-1) = frac{1}{3}]And then by 3:[frac{1}{3} times 3 = 1]Hmm, so according to my calculations, the final result is 1. But I recall that when I first saw the problem, I thought it might be (frac{3}{4}). Did I make a mistake in simplifying?Wait, let me check the first term again. Maybe I messed up the signs.First term:[1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ} = 1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} - frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3} - 2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3}]Wait, that step seems off. Let me redo that.Actually, (1 = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}}), so:[1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} - frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3} - 2}{sqrt{3}}]But to rationalize the denominator, I should multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt{3}):[frac{(sqrt{3} - 2)sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3} times sqrt{3}} = frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3}]Yes, that's correct. So the first term is indeed (frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3}).Similarly, the second term:[1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ} = 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} + frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3} + 2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}]That's also correct.So, the product of the first two terms:[frac{3 - 2sqrt{3}}{3} times frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{(3)^2 - (2sqrt{3})^2}{9} = frac{9 - 12}{9} = -frac{3}{9} = -frac{1}{3}]Okay, that's correct.Then, multiplying by (-1):[-frac{1}{3} times (-1) = frac{1}{3}]And then by 3:[frac{1}{3} times 3 = 1]So, according to my calculations, the result is 1. But I thought it might be (frac{3}{4}). Maybe I was mistaken earlier.Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I can pair the terms differently.Let me pair the first and fourth terms, and the second and third terms.First and fourth terms:[left(1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ}right) times left(1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ}right)]Second and third terms:[left(1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ}right) times left(1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ}right)]Let me compute each pair separately.First pair:[left(1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ}right) times left(1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ}right)]Substituting the values:[left(1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) times left(1 + 2right) = left(1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) times 3]Which is:[3 times 1 - 3 times frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = 3 - frac{6}{sqrt{3}} = 3 - 2sqrt{3}]Second pair:[left(1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ}right) times left(1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ}right)]Substituting the values:[left(1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) times left(1 - 2right) = left(1 + frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) times (-1)]Which is:[-1 times 1 -1 times frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = -1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}}]Now, multiplying the two results together:[(3 - 2sqrt{3}) times left(-1 - frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right)]Let me expand this:[3 times (-1) + 3 times left(-frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) - 2sqrt{3} times (-1) - 2sqrt{3} times left(-frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right)]Calculating each term:1. (3 times (-1) = -3)2. (3 times left(-frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) = -frac{6}{sqrt{3}} = -2sqrt{3})3. (-2sqrt{3} times (-1) = 2sqrt{3})4. (-2sqrt{3} times left(-frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right) = frac{4sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = 4)Now, adding all these together:[-3 - 2sqrt{3} + 2sqrt{3} + 4 = (-3 + 4) + (-2sqrt{3} + 2sqrt{3}) = 1 + 0 = 1]So, again, I get 1 as the result. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought of (frac{3}{4}) was wrong, and the correct answer is indeed 1.Wait, but let me check my first approach again. I think I might have made a mistake in the order of operations or in pairing.Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term numerically to see what's happening.Let me compute each term numerically:First term: (1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ})(cos 30^circ approx 0.8660), so (frac{1}{cos 30^circ} approx 1.1547)Thus, (1 - 1.1547 approx -0.1547)Second term: (1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ})(sin 60^circ approx 0.8660), so (frac{1}{sin 60^circ} approx 1.1547)Thus, (1 + 1.1547 approx 2.1547)Third term: (1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ})(sin 30^circ = 0.5), so (frac{1}{sin 30^circ} = 2)Thus, (1 - 2 = -1)Fourth term: (1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ})(cos 60^circ = 0.5), so (frac{1}{cos 60^circ} = 2)Thus, (1 + 2 = 3)Now, multiplying all four terms together:(-0.1547 times 2.1547 times (-1) times 3)First, multiply (-0.1547 times 2.1547):(-0.1547 times 2.1547 approx -0.3333)Then, multiply by (-1):(-0.3333 times (-1) = 0.3333)Finally, multiply by 3:(0.3333 times 3 = 1)So, numerically, I also get 1. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct, and the result is indeed 1.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had a different approach and got (frac{3}{4}). Maybe I should check that approach.Looking back, the user's solution had:[left( 1 - frac{1}{cos 30^circ} right) = frac{cos 30^circ - 1}{cos 30^circ},left( 1 + frac{1}{sin 60^circ} right) = frac{sin 60^circ + 1}{sin 60^circ},left( 1 - frac{1}{sin 30^circ} right) = frac{sin 30^circ - 1}{sin 30^circ},left( 1 + frac{1}{cos 60^circ} right) = frac{cos 60^circ + 1}{cos 60^circ}.]Then substituting the values:[= frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - 1}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} cdot frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} cdot frac{frac{1}{2} - 1}{frac{1}{2}} cdot frac{frac{1}{2} + 1}{frac{1}{2}}]Simplifying each fraction:[= frac{sqrt{3} - 2}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{sqrt{3} + 2}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{-1}{2} cdot frac{3}{2}]Then, multiplying the first two terms:[frac{(sqrt{3} - 2)(sqrt{3} + 2)}{sqrt{3}^2} = frac{1 - 4}{3} = frac{-3}{3} = -1]Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Let me see:[(sqrt{3} - 2)(sqrt{3} + 2) = (sqrt{3})^2 - (2)^2 = 3 - 4 = -1]So, (frac{-1}{3}). Then, multiplying by (frac{-1}{2}) and (frac{3}{2}):[frac{-1}{3} times frac{-1}{2} times frac{3}{2} = frac{1}{3} times frac{3}{2} = frac{1}{2}]Wait, that's not matching. Wait, let me recast it:Original expression after substitution:[frac{sqrt{3} - 2}{sqrt{3}} times frac{sqrt{3} + 2}{sqrt{3}} times frac{-1}{2} times frac{3}{2}]First, multiply the first two fractions:[frac{(sqrt{3} - 2)(sqrt{3} + 2)}{(sqrt{3})^2} = frac{3 - 4}{3} = frac{-1}{3}]Then, multiply by the next two fractions:[frac{-1}{3} times frac{-1}{2} times frac{3}{2} = frac{1}{3} times frac{3}{2} = frac{1}{2}]Wait, that's different from both my initial result and the numerical calculation. So, there must be a mistake in the user's approach.Wait, let me check the user's step:They had:[frac{sqrt{3} - 2}{sqrt{3}} times frac{sqrt{3} + 2}{sqrt{3}} times frac{-1}{2} times frac{3}{2}]Which is:[frac{(sqrt{3} - 2)(sqrt{3} + 2)}{3} times frac{-1}{2} times frac{3}{2}]Calculating the numerator:[(sqrt{3} - 2)(sqrt{3} + 2) = 3 - 4 = -1]So, the first part is (frac{-1}{3}).Then, multiplying by (frac{-1}{2}):[frac{-1}{3} times frac{-1}{2} = frac{1}{6}]Then, multiplying by (frac{3}{2}):[frac{1}{6} times frac{3}{2} = frac{3}{12} = frac{1}{4}]Wait, that's not matching either. So, the user's calculation seems to have an error in the multiplication steps.In my calculation, I got 1, and numerically it also gives 1. So, I think the correct answer is 1, and the user's approach had an error in the multiplication steps.Therefore, the final answer should be 1."},{"question":"Given an even function f(x) defined on mathbb{R} that satisfies: for x in [0, +infty),f(x)= begin{cases} 2-x, & xgeq 2  x^{2}+1, & 0leq x<2 end{cases}then the value of f[f(-2)] is (　　)A: 1  B: 3  C: -2  D: -3","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about an even function ( f(x) ) defined on all real numbers. The function is given in two parts for ( x ) in the interval ([0, +infty)). Specifically, it's defined as:[f(x) = begin{cases} 2 - x, & text{if } x geq 2 x^2 + 1, & text{if } 0 leq x < 2 end{cases}]And since it's an even function, I know that ( f(-x) = f(x) ) for all ( x ). The question is asking for the value of ( f[f(-2)] ), and the options are A: 1, B: 3, C: -2, D: -3.Okay, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to find ( f(-2) ), and then use that result to find ( f[f(-2)] ).Since ( f(x) ) is even, ( f(-2) = f(2) ). That simplifies things because I can just compute ( f(2) ) instead of dealing with negative numbers directly. Looking at the definition of ( f(x) ) for ( x geq 2 ), it's ( 2 - x ). So plugging in 2, we get:[f(2) = 2 - 2 = 0]Therefore, ( f(-2) = 0 ).Now, I need to find ( f[f(-2)] ), which is ( f(0) ). Let's compute ( f(0) ). Since 0 is in the interval ([0, 2)), we use the second part of the piecewise function, which is ( x^2 + 1 ). Plugging in 0:[f(0) = 0^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1]So, ( f[f(-2)] = f(0) = 1 ).Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, ( f(-2) ) is indeed equal to ( f(2) ) because the function is even. Then, ( f(2) = 2 - 2 = 0 ). That seems correct. Then, ( f(0) ) is ( 0^2 + 1 = 1 ). Yeah, that looks right.I wonder if I should consider the negative side of the function for ( f(-2) ). But since it's even, it's symmetric, so it's the same as the positive side. So, no, I don't need to redefine the function for negative values separately because the evenness takes care of that.Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by explicitly writing out the function for negative ( x ). Since ( f(x) ) is even, for ( x < 0 ), ( f(x) = f(-x) ). So, for ( x leq -2 ), ( f(x) = f(-x) = 2 - (-x) = 2 + x ). And for ( -2 < x leq 0 ), ( f(x) = f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 1 = x^2 + 1 ).So, if I write the function for negative ( x ):[f(x) = begin{cases} 2 + x, & text{if } x leq -2 x^2 + 1, & text{if } -2 < x leq 0 end{cases}]Now, plugging in ( x = -2 ), we get ( f(-2) = 2 + (-2) = 0 ). So that's consistent with what I found earlier.Then, ( f(0) ) is still ( 0^2 + 1 = 1 ). So, ( f[f(-2)] = 1 ).Just to make sure, let me visualize the function. For positive ( x ), from 0 to 2, it's a parabola opening upwards, starting at ( f(0) = 1 ) and going up to ( f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 ). Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense because at ( x = 2 ), the function switches to ( 2 - x ), which would be ( 0 ). So, actually, at ( x = 2 ), the function is 0, not 5. That means there's a jump discontinuity at ( x = 2 ). So, from 0 to 2, it's a parabola increasing from 1 to 5, but at ( x = 2 ), it drops to 0 and then continues as a linear function decreasing for ( x > 2 ).But since we're dealing with ( x = -2 ), which is on the negative side, and we've already established that ( f(-2) = 0 ), which is the same as ( f(2) ). Then, ( f(0) ) is 1.I think I'm confident that the answer is 1, which is option A.Wait, just to ensure I didn't misread the function. The function is defined as ( 2 - x ) for ( x geq 2 ). So, at ( x = 2 ), it's ( 2 - 2 = 0 ). For ( x ) just above 2, like 2.1, it's ( 2 - 2.1 = -0.1 ). So, it's decreasing for ( x geq 2 ). But since we're dealing with ( x = 2 ), it's 0.And for ( x ) between 0 and 2, it's ( x^2 + 1 ), which is a parabola opening upwards, starting at ( x = 0 ) with ( f(0) = 1 ) and going up to ( x = 2 ) with ( f(2) = 5 ). But wait, at ( x = 2 ), according to the first case, it's 0. So, actually, there's a discontinuity at ( x = 2 ). The left-hand limit as ( x ) approaches 2 from below is 5, and the right-hand limit is 0. So, the function is not continuous at ( x = 2 ).But that shouldn't affect our calculation because we're evaluating at ( x = 2 ) directly, which is 0, and ( x = 0 ), which is 1.So, yeah, I think my reasoning holds. ( f(-2) = 0 ) and ( f(0) = 1 ), so ( f[f(-2)] = 1 ).I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the answer is A: 1."},{"question":"Given the complex number z=(1+ai)(1-i), where i is the imaginary unit, if z is a purely imaginary number, find the value of the real number a, and the value of |z+i|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this complex number problem here. It says, \\"Given the complex number z equals (1 plus ai) times (1 minus i), where i is the imaginary unit. If z is a purely imaginary number, find the value of the real number a, and the value of |z plus i|.\\" Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part. So, if z is purely imaginary, that means its real part must be zero. That's the key here. So, I need to expand the given expression for z and then set the real part equal to zero to solve for a.Alright, let's start by expanding z. So, z is (1 + ai)(1 - i). I can use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for multiplying two binomials. Let's do that.First, multiply the First terms: 1 times 1 is 1.Next, the Outer terms: 1 times (-i) is -i.Then, the Inner terms: ai times 1 is ai.Lastly, the Last terms: ai times (-i) is -ai squared.So, putting it all together, z equals 1 - i + ai - ai squared.Now, I remember that i squared is equal to -1. So, let's substitute that in. So, -ai squared becomes -a times (-1), which is +a.So, now, z equals 1 - i + ai + a.Let me combine like terms. The real parts are 1 and a, so that's (1 + a). The imaginary parts are -i and ai, so that's (-1 + a)i.So, z equals (1 + a) + (a - 1)i.Since z is purely imaginary, the real part must be zero. So, 1 + a equals zero. Let me write that down:1 + a = 0Solving for a, I subtract 1 from both sides:a = -1Okay, so a is -1. That's the first part done.Now, I need to find |z + i|. Let me first find z with a = -1.So, z was (1 + a) + (a - 1)i. Plugging in a = -1:Real part: 1 + (-1) = 0Imaginary part: (-1 - 1)i = (-2)iSo, z is 0 - 2i, which is just -2i.Now, I need to compute |z + i|. So, z is -2i, and adding i gives:-2i + i = (-2 + 1)i = -iSo, z + i is -i.Now, the modulus of a complex number is the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts. But in this case, z + i is -i, which is 0 - 1i. So, the modulus is sqrt(0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(0 + 1) = sqrt(1) = 1.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my steps.Wait, when I computed z, I got z = -2i. Then z + i is -2i + i = (-2 + 1)i = -i. So, |z + i| is |-i|. The modulus of -i is indeed 1, because it's the distance from the origin in the complex plane, which is just 1 unit along the imaginary axis.But hold on, in the initial problem statement, it says \\"find the value of |z + i|.\\" So, according to my calculation, that's 1. But wait, in the previous assistant's response, they got 3. Did I make a mistake?Let me go back and check.Wait, when I expanded z, I got (1 + a) + (a - 1)i. Then, setting the real part to zero, 1 + a = 0, so a = -1. Then, z is (1 + (-1)) + (-1 - 1)i = 0 - 2i. So, z is -2i. Then, z + i is -2i + i = -i. So, |z + i| is |-i|, which is sqrt(0^2 + (-1)^2) = 1.But the assistant got 3. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.Wait, let me check the expansion again. z = (1 + ai)(1 - i). Let me multiply it out again:1*1 = 11*(-i) = -iai*1 = aiai*(-i) = -ai^2 = -a(-1) = aSo, z = 1 - i + ai + a = (1 + a) + (a - 1)i. That seems correct.So, setting real part to zero: 1 + a = 0 => a = -1. That seems correct.Then, z = (1 + (-1)) + (-1 -1)i = 0 - 2i. So, z = -2i.Then, z + i = -2i + i = -i.So, modulus is sqrt(0^2 + (-1)^2) = 1.Wait, but the assistant said |z + i| = 3. Maybe they made a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.The problem says: \\"find the value of the real number a, and the value of |z + i|.\\"So, I think my calculation is correct. So, maybe the assistant made a mistake.Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the modulus. Let me recall that the modulus of a complex number x + yi is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So, for z + i = -i, which is 0 - i, so x = 0, y = -1. So, modulus is sqrt(0 + 1) = 1.Alternatively, maybe the problem was |z + i|, but z is -2i, so z + i = -2i + i = -i. So, modulus is 1.Wait, but in the assistant's response, they said |z + i| = 3. Let me see what they did.They said z = -2i, then |z + i| = |-2i + i| = |-i| = 1. Wait, no, in their response, they said |z + i| = |2i + i| = |3i| = 3. Wait, that's not correct because z is -2i, not 2i.Wait, looking back, the assistant wrote:\\"Thus, z = -2i, and consequently, bar{z} = 2i.\\"Wait, bar{z} is the complex conjugate of z. So, if z = -2i, then bar{z} is 2i. So, then they computed |z + i| as |bar{z} + i| = |2i + i| = |3i| = 3.Wait, but that's incorrect because |z + i| is not equal to |bar{z} + i|. That's a mistake. They confused z with its conjugate.So, in reality, z is -2i, so z + i is -2i + i = -i, whose modulus is 1. So, the correct answer should be 1, not 3.Therefore, the assistant made a mistake in their solution by incorrectly using the conjugate instead of z itself.So, to summarize, a is -1, and |z + i| is 1.Wait, but let me double-check everything again to be sure.Given z = (1 + ai)(1 - i). Let's compute z with a = -1.So, z = (1 - i)(1 - i). Wait, no, a is -1, so it's (1 + (-1)i)(1 - i) = (1 - i)(1 - i).Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did earlier. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, (1 + ai) is (1 + (-1)i) = 1 - i. So, z = (1 - i)(1 - i). So, that's (1 - i)^2.Wait, so z = (1 - i)^2. Let's compute that.(1 - i)^2 = 1^2 - 2*1*i + (i)^2 = 1 - 2i + (-1) = 0 - 2i. So, z = -2i. So, that's correct.Then, z + i = -2i + i = -i. So, modulus is 1.Wait, but in the assistant's solution, they said z = -2i, then they took the conjugate, which is 2i, and then added i to get 3i, modulus 3. But that's incorrect because the problem asks for |z + i|, not |bar{z} + i|.So, the correct answer is |z + i| = 1.Therefore, the value of a is -1, and |z + i| is 1.Wait, but I'm confused because the assistant got 3. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I misapplied the modulus. Let me compute |z + i| directly.Given z = -2i, then z + i = -2i + i = -i. So, in the complex plane, this is the point (0, -1). The modulus is the distance from the origin, which is sqrt(0^2 + (-1)^2) = 1.Alternatively, maybe the problem was |z + i|, but z is (1 + ai)(1 - i). So, maybe I should compute |z + i| without substituting a first.Let me try that.So, z = (1 + ai)(1 - i) = (1 + a) + (a - 1)i.Then, z + i = (1 + a) + (a - 1)i + i = (1 + a) + (a - 1 + 1)i = (1 + a) + a i.So, z + i = (1 + a) + a i.Then, the modulus |z + i| is sqrt[(1 + a)^2 + (a)^2].But since we found a = -1, let's substitute that in.So, (1 + (-1))^2 + (-1)^2 = (0)^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. So, sqrt(1) = 1.Therefore, |z + i| is 1.So, that confirms it again.Therefore, the correct answers are a = -1 and |z + i| = 1.I think the assistant made a mistake by incorrectly using the conjugate of z instead of z itself when computing |z + i|. So, their answer for |z + i| was wrong, but the value of a was correct.So, in conclusion, a is -1, and |z + i| is 1."},{"question":"Given integers (a > 1), (b > 2), show that (a^b + 1 geq b cdot (a+1)). When do we have equality?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given integers (a > 1) and (b > 2), I need to show that (a^b + 1 geq b cdot (a + 1)). And also, I need to figure out when equality holds. Hmm, let's see.First, I should probably understand what the inequality is saying. It compares (a^b + 1) with (b cdot (a + 1)). Since both (a) and (b) are greater than 1 and 2 respectively, they are at least 2 and 3. So, maybe I can plug in some small values to see if the inequality holds and get a sense of when equality might occur.Let me try (a = 2) and (b = 3). Then, (2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9), and (3 cdot (2 + 1) = 3 cdot 3 = 9). So, in this case, (9 = 9), which means equality holds here. Interesting.What if I take (a = 2) and (b = 4)? Then, (2^4 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17), and (4 cdot (2 + 1) = 4 cdot 3 = 12). So, (17 > 12), which satisfies the inequality.How about (a = 3) and (b = 3)? Then, (3^3 + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28), and (3 cdot (3 + 1) = 3 cdot 4 = 12). Again, (28 > 12), so the inequality holds.Wait, so far, the only time equality holds is when (a = 2) and (b = 3). Maybe that's the only case? I should check another value where (a) is larger.Let's try (a = 3) and (b = 4). Then, (3^4 + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82), and (4 cdot (3 + 1) = 4 cdot 4 = 16). So, (82 > 16), which is way bigger. It seems like as (a) and (b) increase, the left side grows much faster than the right side.Maybe I should think about how to prove this inequality in general. Since both (a) and (b) are integers greater than 1 and 2 respectively, perhaps I can use mathematical induction. Induction is often useful for proving statements that involve integers.Let me try to fix one variable and induct on the other. Maybe fix (a) and induct on (b). So, let's suppose that for some (b), the inequality (a^b + 1 geq b(a + 1)) holds. Then, I need to show that (a^{b+1} + 1 geq (b + 1)(a + 1)).Starting with the left side: (a^{b+1} + 1 = a cdot a^b + 1). From the induction hypothesis, I know that (a^b + 1 geq b(a + 1)). So, multiplying both sides by (a), I get (a cdot a^b + a geq a cdot b(a + 1)).But wait, the left side of this new inequality is (a^{b+1} + a), which is actually greater than (a^{b+1} + 1) because (a > 1). So, (a^{b+1} + 1 leq a^{b+1} + a). Therefore, (a^{b+1} + 1 leq a^{b+1} + a leq a cdot b(a + 1)).But I need to show that (a^{b+1} + 1 geq (b + 1)(a + 1)). Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I need another approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference between the two sides: (a^b + 1 - b(a + 1)). If I can show that this difference is always non-negative for (a > 1) and (b > 2), then the inequality holds.Let me compute this difference for (a = 2) and (b = 3): (8 + 1 - 3 cdot 3 = 9 - 9 = 0). For (a = 2) and (b = 4): (16 + 1 - 4 cdot 3 = 17 - 12 = 5). For (a = 3) and (b = 3): (27 + 1 - 3 cdot 4 = 28 - 12 = 16). So, it seems like the difference increases as (a) and (b) increase.Maybe I can analyze the function (f(b) = a^b + 1 - b(a + 1)) and show that it's increasing for (b > 2). If I can show that the derivative with respect to (b) is positive, then since (f(3) = 0) when (a = 2), it would imply that for (b > 3), (f(b) > 0).But since (b) is an integer, perhaps I can use discrete calculus or look at the difference (f(b + 1) - f(b)). Let's compute that:(f(b + 1) - f(b) = [a^{b+1} + 1 - (b + 1)(a + 1)] - [a^b + 1 - b(a + 1)])Simplifying:(a^{b+1} + 1 - (b + 1)(a + 1) - a^b - 1 + b(a + 1))Simplify further:(a^{b+1} - a^b - (b + 1)(a + 1) + b(a + 1))Factor out (a^b):(a^b(a - 1) - (a + 1))So, (f(b + 1) - f(b) = a^b(a - 1) - (a + 1))Now, since (a > 1), (a - 1) is positive. Also, (a^b) is at least (2^3 = 8) when (a = 2) and (b = 3). So, (a^b(a - 1)) is significantly larger than (a + 1) for (a > 1) and (b > 2). Therefore, (f(b + 1) - f(b) > 0), which means (f(b)) is increasing for (b > 2).Since (f(3) = 0) when (a = 2), and (f(b)) increases as (b) increases, (f(b) > 0) for (b > 3). For (a > 2), (f(3)) is already positive, so (f(b)) remains positive for all (b > 2).Therefore, the inequality (a^b + 1 geq b(a + 1)) holds for all integers (a > 1) and (b > 2). Equality occurs only when (a = 2) and (b = 3), as that's the only case where (f(b) = 0).I think this makes sense. I've checked specific cases, analyzed the function, and used induction-like reasoning to show the inequality holds. The key insight was recognizing that the difference between the two sides increases as (b) increases, ensuring the inequality is maintained."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system, A(1,0), B(3,0), C(-1,4), a moving point P satisfies |PA|^{2}+|PB|^{2}=10.

Adding these together, I get:|PA|² + |PB|² = (x - 1)² + y² + (x - 3)² + y²Let me expand these terms:(x - 1)² = x² - 2x + 1(x - 3)² = x² - 6x + 9So, adding them up:(x² - 2x + 1) + y² + (x² - 6x + 9) + y² = 10Combine like terms:2x² - 8x + 10 + 2y² = 10Subtract 10 from both sides:2x² - 8x + 2y² = 0Divide both sides by 2:x² - 4x + y² = 0Hmm, this looks like the equation of a circle, but it's not in the standard form. Let me complete the square for the x terms. The coefficient of x is -4, so half of that is -2, and squaring it gives 4. So, I add and subtract 4:x² - 4x + 4 - 4 + y² = 0This can be written as:(x - 2)² + y² - 4 = 0Or,(x - 2)² + y² = 4So, the equation of the locus of point P is a circle with center at (2, 0) and radius 2. That matches option A: (x - 2)² + y² = 4. So, A is correct.Next, let's look at option B: The maximum value of the area of triangle PAB is 2.To find the area of triangle PAB, I can use the formula:Area = (1/2) * base * heightHere, the base can be the distance between points A and B. Let me calculate |AB|:A is (1, 0) and B is (3, 0). So, |AB| = sqrt[(3 - 1)² + (0 - 0)²] = sqrt[4] = 2.So, the base is 2. Now, the height would be the maximum distance from point P to the line AB. Since AB is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of P will determine the height. The maximum area occurs when the height is maximized.Looking at the circle equation (x - 2)² + y² = 4, the maximum y-coordinate occurs at the top of the circle, which is y = 2. So, the maximum height is 2.Therefore, the maximum area is (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2. So, option B is correct.Moving on to option C: There is only one line passing through point C that is tangent to the locus of point P.Point C is (-1, 4). To determine how many tangent lines can be drawn from C to the circle (x - 2)² + y² = 4, I can use the formula for the number of tangents from a point to a circle. The number depends on the distance from the point to the center compared to the radius.First, let's find the distance from C to the center of the circle, which is (2, 0).Distance = sqrt[(-1 - 2)² + (4 - 0)²] = sqrt[(-3)² + 4²] = sqrt[9 + 16] = sqrt[25] = 5.The radius of the circle is 2. Since the distance from C to the center (5) is greater than the radius (2), there are two distinct tangent lines from point C to the circle. Therefore, option C is incorrect because it states there is only one tangent line.Finally, option D: Let the minimum value of |CP| be a, when m + n = a (m > 0, n > 0), the minimum value of (3/m) + (1/n) is (4 + 2√3)/3.First, I need to find the minimum value of |CP|. Point C is (-1, 4), and P lies on the circle (x - 2)² + y² = 4. The minimum distance from C to any point P on the circle is the distance from C to the center minus the radius.Distance from C to center (2, 0) is 5, as calculated earlier. So, the minimum |CP| is 5 - 2 = 3. Therefore, a = 3.Given m + n = 3, with m > 0 and n > 0, we need to minimize the expression (3/m) + (1/n).This is an optimization problem. I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Alternatively, I can use substitution.Let me express n in terms of m: n = 3 - m.Then, the expression becomes:(3/m) + (1/(3 - m))Let me denote this as f(m) = 3/m + 1/(3 - m), where 0 < m < 3.To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(m) with respect to m and set it to zero.f'(m) = -3/m² + 1/(3 - m)²Set f'(m) = 0:-3/m² + 1/(3 - m)² = 0=> 1/(3 - m)² = 3/m²Take square roots on both sides (since both sides are positive):1/(3 - m) = sqrt(3)/mCross-multiplying:m = sqrt(3)(3 - m)=> m = 3 sqrt(3) - sqrt(3) mBring terms with m to one side:m + sqrt(3) m = 3 sqrt(3)=> m(1 + sqrt(3)) = 3 sqrt(3)=> m = (3 sqrt(3))/(1 + sqrt(3))Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(3)) to rationalize:m = [3 sqrt(3)(1 - sqrt(3))]/[(1 + sqrt(3))(1 - sqrt(3))] = [3 sqrt(3) - 9]/(1 - 3) = [3 sqrt(3) - 9]/(-2) = (9 - 3 sqrt(3))/2Similarly, n = 3 - m = 3 - (9 - 3 sqrt(3))/2 = (6 - 9 + 3 sqrt(3))/2 = (-3 + 3 sqrt(3))/2 = 3(sqrt(3) - 1)/2Now, plug m and n back into the expression (3/m) + (1/n):First, compute 3/m:3/m = 3 / [(9 - 3 sqrt(3))/2] = 3 * [2 / (9 - 3 sqrt(3))] = 6 / (9 - 3 sqrt(3)) = 6 / [3(3 - sqrt(3))] = 2 / (3 - sqrt(3))Multiply numerator and denominator by (3 + sqrt(3)):2(3 + sqrt(3)) / [(3 - sqrt(3))(3 + sqrt(3))] = [6 + 2 sqrt(3)] / (9 - 3) = [6 + 2 sqrt(3)] / 6 = (6 + 2 sqrt(3))/6 = (3 + sqrt(3))/3Similarly, compute 1/n:1/n = 1 / [3(sqrt(3) - 1)/2] = 2 / [3(sqrt(3) - 1)] = 2 / [3 sqrt(3) - 3]Multiply numerator and denominator by (3 sqrt(3) + 3):2(3 sqrt(3) + 3) / [(3 sqrt(3) - 3)(3 sqrt(3) + 3)] = [6 sqrt(3) + 6] / (27 - 9) = [6 sqrt(3) + 6] / 18 = [sqrt(3) + 1]/3Now, add 3/m and 1/n:(3 + sqrt(3))/3 + (sqrt(3) + 1)/3 = [3 + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3) + 1]/3 = (4 + 2 sqrt(3))/3So, the minimum value of (3/m) + (1/n) is indeed (4 + 2 sqrt(3))/3. Therefore, option D is correct.To summarize:- A: Correct- B: Correct- C: Incorrect- D: CorrectSo, the correct options are A, B, and D.**Final Answer**The correct options are boxed{A}, boxed{B}, and boxed{D}."},{"question":"In the interior of a cube of side  6  there are  1001  unit cubes with the faces parallel to the faces of the given cube. Prove that there are  2  unit cubes with the property that the center of one of them lies in the interior or on one of the faces of the other cube.\\r\\r*Dinu Serbanescu*","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a cube with side length 6, and inside it, there are 1001 unit cubes. The unit cubes are aligned such that their faces are parallel to the faces of the larger cube. The task is to prove that among these 1001 unit cubes, there are at least two where the center of one lies inside or on the face of the other.Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. The big cube is 6 units on each side, so it's a pretty sizable cube. If I imagine it, it's like a Rubik's cube but much larger—6x6x6. Now, inside this, we have 1001 smaller cubes, each of size 1x1x1. That's a lot of small cubes. I wonder how they're arranged.First, let me think about the total number of unit cubes that can fit inside the larger cube. Since each side is 6 units, the total number is 6x6x6, which is 216. Wait, but we have 1001 unit cubes inside. That seems impossible because 1001 is way more than 216. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem.Wait, no, the problem says there are 1001 unit cubes inside the interior of the cube of side 6. But the interior of a cube of side 6 would exclude the outermost layers, right? So, the interior would be a 4x4x4 cube, which is 64 unit cubes. But 1001 is still way more than 64. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm interpreting \\"interior\\" incorrectly.Wait, perhaps \\"interior\\" here doesn't mean the inner part excluding the outermost layers, but just the inside in general. So, the unit cubes are placed anywhere inside the larger cube, not necessarily on the surface. So, the total number of unit cubes that can fit inside is 6x6x6=216, but we have 1001 unit cubes. That still doesn't add up. 1001 is way more than 216. So, maybe the unit cubes are overlapping? But the problem says they have faces parallel to the larger cube, so they can't be overlapping in a way that their faces aren't aligned.Wait, hold on. Maybe the unit cubes are not necessarily axis-aligned? But the problem says their faces are parallel to the faces of the given cube, so they must be axis-aligned. Therefore, each unit cube occupies a specific position in the grid of the larger cube.But then, how can there be 1001 unit cubes in a 6x6x6 cube? That seems impossible because 6x6x6 is only 216. Maybe the unit cubes are not entirely within the larger cube? But the problem says they are in the interior, so they must be entirely within. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, perhaps the unit cubes are not necessarily adjacent or non-overlapping? But if they are axis-aligned, they can't overlap because each unit cube occupies a specific 1x1x1 space. So, 1001 unit cubes in a 6x6x6 cube is impossible because 6x6x6 is only 216. So, maybe the problem is not about fitting 1001 unit cubes, but about something else.Wait, let me read the problem again: \\"In the interior of a cube of side 6 there are 1001 unit cubes with the faces parallel to the faces of the given cube. Prove that there are 2 unit cubes with the property that the center of one of them lies in the interior or on one of the faces of the other cube.\\"Oh, maybe the unit cubes are not necessarily entirely within the larger cube? But the problem says they are in the interior, so they must be entirely within. Hmm, this is perplexing.Wait, perhaps the unit cubes can be placed anywhere within the larger cube, overlapping or not, but their faces are parallel. So, maybe they can overlap? But if they are axis-aligned, overlapping would mean that their centers are close enough.But the problem is to prove that two of them have centers such that one center lies inside or on the face of the other. So, if two unit cubes are close enough, their centers would be within a certain distance.Wait, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle here. If I can divide the larger cube into smaller regions such that if two centers are in the same region, then one center lies inside or on the face of the other cube.Let me think about the centers of the unit cubes. Each unit cube has a center point. If I can show that two centers are close enough, then one must lie inside or on the face of the other.What's the maximum distance between two centers such that one lies inside or on the face of the other? If two unit cubes are adjacent, their centers are 1 unit apart. If they are overlapping, the centers are less than 1 unit apart. If they are just touching on a face, the centers are 1 unit apart.Wait, so if two centers are within 1 unit of each other, then one cube must lie inside or on the face of the other. Because the distance between centers is less than or equal to 1, so the cubes are either overlapping or touching.But if the centers are more than 1 unit apart, then the cubes are separate. So, to ensure that two centers are within 1 unit of each other, I can divide the larger cube into smaller regions where each region has a diameter less than 1. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, if I have more unit cubes than regions, two centers must lie within the same region, hence within 1 unit of each other.So, how can I divide the larger cube into regions with diameter less than 1? Let me think about dividing each dimension into smaller intervals.The larger cube has side length 6, so if I divide each side into intervals of length 1, I get 6 intervals per side, resulting in 6x6x6=216 smaller cubes. But we have 1001 unit cubes, which is way more than 216. So, this approach won't work because 1001 > 216, but the pigeonhole principle would only guarantee that two centers are in the same small cube if we have more centers than regions.Wait, maybe I need to divide the cube into smaller regions. Let me think about dividing each side into smaller segments. If I divide each side into n segments, then each small region will have side length 6/n. The diameter of each small region would be the space diagonal, which is sqrt(3)*(6/n). I want this diameter to be less than 1, so sqrt(3)*(6/n) < 1, which implies n > 6*sqrt(3) ≈ 10.39. So, n needs to be at least 11.But 11 is a prime number, and dividing 6 into 11 equal parts would result in non-integer divisions, which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can use a grid that divides the cube into smaller cubes with side length 1/2. Then, each small cube would have a diameter of sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is less than 1. So, if I divide each side into 12 segments (since 6/(1/2)=12), I get 12x12x12=1728 small cubes. But 1728 is way more than 1001, so the pigeonhole principle doesn't help here because 1001 < 1728.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the centers of the unit cubes. Each center must lie within the larger cube, but since the unit cubes are entirely within the larger cube, the centers must be at least 0.5 units away from each face of the larger cube. So, the centers lie within a 5x5x5 cube centered within the larger cube.So, the centers are confined to a 5x5x5 cube. Now, if I can divide this 5x5x5 cube into smaller regions such that if two centers are in the same region, they are within 1 unit of each other. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, if I have more centers than regions, two must be in the same region.Let me try dividing the 5x5x5 cube into smaller cubes. If I divide each side into 10 equal parts, each small cube will have side length 0.5. The diameter of each small cube is sqrt(3)*(0.5) ≈ 0.866, which is less than 1. So, if two centers are in the same small cube, they are within 0.866 units of each other, which is less than 1. Therefore, one cube must lie inside or on the face of the other.Now, how many small cubes do I have? Each side is divided into 10, so total regions are 10x10x10=1000. We have 1001 centers. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two centers must lie within the same small cube. Therefore, these two centers are within 0.866 units of each other, meaning one cube lies inside or on the face of the other.Wait, that seems to work. So, the key idea is to consider the centers of the unit cubes, which lie within a 5x5x5 cube, and then divide this into 1000 smaller cubes each of side 0.5. Since we have 1001 centers, two must be in the same small cube, hence within 0.866 units, so one cube must lie inside or on the face of the other.But let me double-check. If two centers are within 0.866 units, does that guarantee that one cube lies inside or on the face of the other? Let's see. The maximum distance between centers for one cube to lie inside the other is 1 unit. If the centers are less than 1 unit apart, then the cubes overlap or touch. So, yes, if the centers are within 0.866 units, which is less than 1, then one cube must lie inside or on the face of the other.Therefore, the proof is complete by the pigeonhole principle."},{"question":"Let O be the origin. Determine if there exists a scalar k such that for any points A, B, C, D, and E, the equation[4 overrightarrow{OA} - 3 overrightarrow{OB} + 6 overrightarrow{OC} + k overrightarrow{OD} + 2 overrightarrow{OE} = mathbf{0}]ensures that the five points A, B, C, D, and E are coplanar. Find k.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if there's a scalar ( k ) such that for any points ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ), the equation[ 4 overrightarrow{OA} - 3 overrightarrow{OB} + 6 overrightarrow{OC} + k overrightarrow{OD} + 2 overrightarrow{OE} = mathbf{0} ]ensures that all five points ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ) are coplanar. I need to find the value of ( k ).Hmm, coplanar points mean that all these points lie on the same plane. So, how does the given vector equation relate to coplanarity? I remember that if points are coplanar, the vectors from the origin to these points must satisfy certain linear dependence conditions.Let me recall that for points to be coplanar, the volume of the parallelepiped formed by any three vectors from the origin should be zero. But in this case, we have five points, so maybe I need a different approach.Wait, another thought: if the given vector equation holds, it might imply that the points are linearly dependent in some way. Specifically, if the coefficients of the vectors add up in a certain way, it could force them to lie on a plane.Looking at the equation:[ 4 overrightarrow{OA} - 3 overrightarrow{OB} + 6 overrightarrow{OC} + k overrightarrow{OD} + 2 overrightarrow{OE} = mathbf{0} ]I notice that the coefficients are 4, -3, 6, ( k ), and 2. Maybe I should check if the sum of these coefficients is zero because that would imply that the points are affine combinations of each other, which is a condition for coplanarity.Calculating the sum:[ 4 - 3 + 6 + k + 2 = (4 - 3) + (6 + 2) + k = 1 + 8 + k = 9 + k ]For the sum to be zero, which is a common condition for affine dependence, we set:[ 9 + k = 0 implies k = -9 ]Wait, so if ( k = -9 ), the sum of the coefficients becomes zero. Does that necessarily mean the points are coplanar?I think so because if the sum of the coefficients is zero, the equation represents a linear combination of the vectors that equals zero, which implies that the points are affinely dependent. In three-dimensional space, five points being affinely dependent means they lie on the same plane.Let me verify this reasoning. If the coefficients sum to zero, then the equation can be rewritten as:[ 4 overrightarrow{OA} - 3 overrightarrow{OB} + 6 overrightarrow{OC} - 9 overrightarrow{OD} + 2 overrightarrow{OE} = mathbf{0} ]This can be rearranged to express one of the vectors as a combination of the others. For example:[ 4 overrightarrow{OA} = 3 overrightarrow{OB} - 6 overrightarrow{OC} + 9 overrightarrow{OD} - 2 overrightarrow{OE} ]Or, dividing both sides by 4:[ overrightarrow{OA} = frac{3}{4} overrightarrow{OB} - frac{6}{4} overrightarrow{OC} + frac{9}{4} overrightarrow{OD} - frac{2}{4} overrightarrow{OE} ]This shows that point ( A ) is an affine combination of points ( B, C, D, ) and ( E ). Since ( A ) lies on the plane defined by ( B, C, D, ) and ( E ), all five points must be coplanar.But wait, does this hold for any points ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E )? The problem states \\"for any points,\\" so the equation must hold regardless of where these points are. Therefore, the condition on ( k ) must be such that the equation enforces coplanarity irrespective of the specific positions of the points.Another way to think about this is using barycentric coordinates or affine combinations. If the coefficients sum to zero, it means that the origin is an affine combination of the points, which in turn implies that the points lie on a hyperplane (which, in 3D, is a plane) passing through the origin. But wait, the origin isn't necessarily one of the points, so maybe that's not the exact reasoning.Alternatively, considering the affine hull: if the points are affinely dependent, their affine hull is a plane, meaning they are coplanar. The condition for affine dependence is that the coefficients sum to zero, which is exactly what we have when ( k = -9 ).Let me also think about the vector equation in terms of linear algebra. The equation can be seen as a linear combination of the vectors ( overrightarrow{OA}, overrightarrow{OB}, overrightarrow{OC}, overrightarrow{OD}, overrightarrow{OE} ) equaling the zero vector. For this to hold for any points ( A, B, C, D, E ), the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions.In three-dimensional space, any four vectors are linearly dependent. So, if we have five vectors, they are certainly linearly dependent. However, the specific combination given here might impose a condition that forces the points into a plane.Wait, but the problem is about coplanarity, not linear dependence. Coplanarity is a weaker condition than linear dependence because coplanar points can still be affinely dependent even if they aren't linearly dependent.So, going back, if the coefficients sum to zero, it's a condition for affine dependence, which in three dimensions implies coplanarity. Therefore, setting ( k = -9 ) ensures that the points are affinely dependent, hence coplanar.Let me also consider another approach. Suppose I rewrite the equation as:[ 4 overrightarrow{OA} - 3 overrightarrow{OB} + 6 overrightarrow{OC} + k overrightarrow{OD} + 2 overrightarrow{OE} = mathbf{0} ]Let me think of this as a linear combination of vectors. For the points to be coplanar, this linear combination must lie in the plane defined by four of the points. But since the equation must hold for any points, the coefficients must satisfy a certain condition.Alternatively, if I consider the affine combination, the sum of the coefficients must be zero for the combination to represent a point in the affine hull. So, as before, the sum of coefficients is ( 4 - 3 + 6 + k + 2 = 9 + k ). Setting this equal to zero gives ( k = -9 ).I think this is consistent with my earlier reasoning. So, it seems that ( k = -9 ) is the required value to ensure coplanarity.Just to make sure, let me think about what happens if ( k ) is not equal to -9. If ( k ) is something else, say ( k = 0 ), then the sum of coefficients is ( 4 - 3 + 6 + 0 + 2 = 9 ), which is not zero. In that case, the equation would not necessarily force the points to be coplanar because the affine dependence condition isn't satisfied. So, only when ( k = -9 ) do we have the sum zero, ensuring coplanarity.Therefore, after considering different angles and verifying my reasoning, I'm confident that ( k = -9 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( k ) is boxed{-9}."},{"question":"If circle E: x^{2}+y^{2}=4 and circle F: x^{2}+(y-a)^{2}=1 have only one common tangent line, then the value of the real number a is ()A: 3B: pm 1C: pm 3D: 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two circles, E and F. Their equations are given as E: x² + y² = 4 and F: x² + (y - a)² = 1. The question is asking for the value of the real number 'a' such that these two circles have only one common tangent line. The options are A: 3, B: ±1, C: ±3, D: 1.Hmm, first, I need to recall what it means for two circles to have only one common tangent. I remember that when two circles are tangent to each other, they have exactly one common tangent at the point where they touch. So, if they have only one common tangent line, it suggests that they are tangent to each other, either externally or internally.Let me think about the properties of circles. Circle E has the equation x² + y² = 4, which is a standard circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius 2, since 4 is 2 squared. Circle F has the equation x² + (y - a)² = 1, so it's centered at (0, a) and has a radius of 1, since 1 is 1 squared.Now, the distance between the centers of the two circles is important here. The centers are at (0,0) and (0,a), so the distance between them is |a - 0| = |a|. If the circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. If they are internally tangent, the distance is equal to the difference of their radii. Since the problem states that they have only one common tangent, it must be the case that they are tangent to each other, either externally or internally.Let me calculate both possibilities.First, external tangency: distance between centers = radius of E + radius of F. That would be |a| = 2 + 1 = 3. So, a could be 3 or -3.Second, internal tangency: distance between centers = |radius of E - radius of F|. That would be |a| = |2 - 1| = 1. So, a could be 1 or -1.Wait, so depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent, 'a' can be ±3 or ±1. But the problem says they have only one common tangent line. Hmm, does that mean they must be tangent, but does it specify external or internal?I think if they are externally tangent, they have exactly one common tangent at the point where they touch, but they also have other common tangents from the outside. Wait, no, actually, if two circles are externally tangent, they have three common tangents: one at the point of contact and two external ones. Similarly, if they are internally tangent, they have exactly one common tangent at the point of contact because one circle is inside the other, so they can't have external tangents.Wait, now I'm confused. Let me double-check. When two circles are externally tangent, they touch at one point, and they have three common tangents: one at the point of contact and two external lines that don't pass between the circles. When they are internally tangent, they touch at one point, and since one is inside the other, they only have one common tangent at that point. So, if the problem states that they have only one common tangent line, that must mean they are internally tangent.Therefore, the distance between centers should be equal to the difference of their radii. So, |a| = 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, a = ±1.Looking back at the options, B is ±1, which matches my conclusion. So, the answer should be B.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. If a = 3 or -3, the distance between centers would be 3, which is equal to the sum of the radii (2 + 1). That would mean the circles are externally tangent, and in that case, they have three common tangents, right? So, if the problem says only one common tangent, it can't be external tangency because that would give three tangents. Therefore, it must be internal tangency, which gives only one tangent line.So, yes, a must be ±1.I think I got it right. So, the correct answer is B: ±1.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Robert had some balls. Tim gave him half of his 40 balls. Now, Robert has 45 balls.

Since we know ( c = 2a ), plugging that into the equation gives ( (2a)^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). Simplifying that, ( 4a^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), which leads to ( b^2 = 3a^2 ). So, ( b = sqrt{3}a ). That's useful because the asymptotes of the hyperbola are ( y = pm frac{b}{a}x ), which in this case would be ( y = pm sqrt{3}x ).Next, the problem mentions a parabola ( C_2: x^2 = 2py ) where ( p > 0 ). I need to find the equation of this parabola. The key piece of information is that the distance from the focus of this parabola to the asymptote of the hyperbola is 2.First, let me recall some properties of parabolas. The standard form ( x^2 = 4py ) has its focus at ( (0, p) ). Wait, in the given equation, it's ( x^2 = 2py ). So, comparing to the standard form, ( 4p' = 2p ), which means ( p' = frac{p}{2} ). So, the focus of the parabola ( x^2 = 2py ) is at ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ).Now, I need to find the distance from this focus ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) to the asymptote of the hyperbola. The asymptotes are ( y = sqrt{3}x ) and ( y = -sqrt{3}x ). Since distance is a positive quantity, and the asymptotes are symmetric, the distance to either asymptote should be the same. So, I can pick one, say ( y = sqrt{3}x ), and compute the distance from ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) to this line.The formula for the distance from a point ( (x_0, y_0) ) to the line ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) is ( frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ). Let me rewrite the asymptote equation in standard form. ( y = sqrt{3}x ) can be rewritten as ( sqrt{3}x - y = 0 ). So, ( A = sqrt{3} ), ( B = -1 ), and ( C = 0 ).Plugging the focus ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ) into the distance formula, we get:( frac{|sqrt{3}(0) + (-1)(frac{p}{2}) + 0|}{sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|frac{-p}{2}|}{sqrt{3 + 1}} = frac{frac{p}{2}}{2} = frac{p}{4} ).Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the calculation. The numerator is ( |0 - frac{p}{2}| = frac{p}{2} ). The denominator is ( sqrt{3 + 1} = 2 ). So, the distance is ( frac{p}{2} div 2 = frac{p}{4} ). Hmm, okay, so the distance is ( frac{p}{4} ).But the problem states that this distance is 2. So, ( frac{p}{4} = 2 ). Solving for ( p ), we get ( p = 8 ).Therefore, the equation of the parabola ( C_2 ) is ( x^2 = 2py ), which becomes ( x^2 = 2*8*y ), so ( x^2 = 16y ).Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the distance calculation. The asymptote is ( y = sqrt{3}x ), which is ( sqrt{3}x - y = 0 ). The point is ( (0, frac{p}{2}) ). Plugging into the distance formula:( frac{|sqrt{3}*0 - 1*frac{p}{2} + 0|}{sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|frac{-p}{2}|}{sqrt{3 + 1}} = frac{frac{p}{2}}{2} = frac{p}{4} ). Yeah, that seems correct.So, if ( frac{p}{4} = 2 ), then ( p = 8 ). Therefore, the equation of the parabola is ( x^2 = 16y ).Just to recap:1. Found the relationship between ( a ) and ( b ) using the eccentricity.2. Determined the asymptotes of the hyperbola.3. Found the focus of the given parabola.4. Calculated the distance from the focus to the asymptote.5. Set the distance equal to 2 and solved for ( p ).6. Plugged ( p ) back into the parabola equation.I think that's all the steps. It seems straightforward once I break it down. I didn't encounter any contradictions or errors in my calculations, so I feel confident about the answer.**Final Answer**The equation of the parabola ( C_2 ) is boxed{x^2 = 16y}."},{"question":"For any positive integer, if the number of  2 's in its digits is greater than the number of  3 's in its digits, we call that is a **good** number. And if the number of  3 's in its digits is more than the number of  2 's in its digits, we call that is a **bad** number. For example, there are two  2 's and one  3  in the number  2023 , so  2023  is a good number. But in the number  123 , the number of  2  and  3  are both one, so  123  is neither a good number nor a bad number. Find the difference of numbers of good numbers and bad numbers among the positive integer not greater than  2023 . ","answer":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find the difference between the number of good numbers and bad numbers among the positive integers not greater than 2023. First, let's make sure I understand the definitions correctly:- A **good number** is a positive integer where the number of 2's in its digits is greater than the number of 3's.- A **bad number** is a positive integer where the number of 3's in its digits is greater than the number of 2's.- If the counts of 2's and 3's are equal, the number is neither good nor bad.So, we need to count all such numbers up to 2023 and find the difference between the counts of good and bad numbers.### Breaking Down the ProblemSince 2023 is a four-digit number, we'll need to consider all numbers from 1 to 2023. This includes numbers with 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits. To make this manageable, I'll break it down into smaller parts:1. **Counting from 1 to 1999**: This includes all four-digit numbers starting from 1000 to 1999, as well as all three-digit, two-digit, and one-digit numbers.2. **Counting from 2000 to 2023**: This is a smaller range, so we can handle it separately.By splitting the problem this way, we can handle the bulk of the numbers (1 to 1999) and then deal with the specific range from 2000 to 2023.### Counting from 1 to 1999Let's denote:- ( G ) as the set of good numbers.- ( B ) as the set of bad numbers.Our goal is to find ( |G| - |B| ) for numbers from 1 to 1999.To approach this, I recall that in combinatorics, sometimes we can use symmetry or bijections to simplify counting. Here's an idea: for every number that is a good number, there might be a corresponding bad number by swapping 2's and 3's. Let's explore this.Consider a number ( n ) in the range 1 to 1999. If we swap every 2 with a 3 and every 3 with a 2 in its digits, we get another number ( m ). - If ( n ) is a good number, then ( m ) will be a bad number, and vice versa.- If ( n ) is neither good nor bad, then ( m ) will also be neither.This suggests a bijection between good numbers and bad numbers in this range. Therefore, the number of good numbers should equal the number of bad numbers from 1 to 1999. Hence, ( |G| - |B| = 0 ) for numbers from 1 to 1999.### Counting from 2000 to 2023Now, let's focus on the numbers from 2000 to 2023. This is a smaller set, so we can analyze each number individually.First, let's list all numbers from 2000 to 2023:2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009,  2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019,  2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.That's 24 numbers in total.Now, let's analyze each number:1. **2000**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 0.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number (1 > 0)2. **2001**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 1.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number3. **2002**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 2.     - Number of 2's: 2     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number4. **2003**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 3.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 1     - Neither good nor bad5. **2004**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 4.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number6. **2005**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 5.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number7. **2006**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 6.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number8. **2007**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 7.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number9. **2008**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 8.     - Number of 2's: 1     - Number of 3's: 0     - Good number10. **2009**: Digits are 2, 0, 0, 9.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number11. **2010**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 0.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number12. **2011**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 1.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number13. **2012**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 2.      - Number of 2's: 2      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number14. **2013**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 3.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 1      - Neither good nor bad15. **2014**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 4.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number16. **2015**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 5.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number17. **2016**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 6.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number18. **2017**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 7.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number19. **2018**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 8.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number20. **2019**: Digits are 2, 0, 1, 9.      - Number of 2's: 1      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number21. **2020**: Digits are 2, 0, 2, 0.      - Number of 2's: 2      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number22. **2021**: Digits are 2, 0, 2, 1.      - Number of 2's: 2      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number23. **2022**: Digits are 2, 0, 2, 2.      - Number of 2's: 3      - Number of 3's: 0      - Good number24. **2023**: Digits are 2, 0, 2, 3.      - Number of 2's: 2      - Number of 3's: 1      - Good number### Analysis of the Range 2000-2023From the above analysis, out of 24 numbers:- **Good numbers**: All except 2003 and 2013.- **Neither good nor bad**: 2003 and 2013.- **Bad numbers**: None.So, there are 22 good numbers and 0 bad numbers in this range.### Combining Both RangesFrom 1 to 1999, the difference ( |G| - |B| = 0 ).From 2000 to 2023, the difference ( |G| - |B| = 22 - 0 = 22 ).Therefore, the total difference from 1 to 2023 is ( 0 + 22 = 22 ).### Final AnswerThe difference between the number of good numbers and bad numbers among the positive integers not greater than 2023 is (boxed{22})."},{"question":"The three-digit positive integer M has a ones digit of 5. What is the probability that M is divisible by 5? Express your answer as a common fraction.","answer":"First, I need to understand what constitutes a three-digit number ending in 5. A three-digit number can be represented as ( M = 100a + 10b + c ), where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are digits, and ( a ) cannot be zero to ensure it's a three-digit number. Since the number ends in 5, ( c = 5 ).Next, I recall the divisibility rule for 5: a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. In this case, the last digit is already 5, which satisfies the condition for divisibility by 5.To find the probability, I need to determine how many three-digit numbers end in 5 and how many of those are divisible by 5. Since any three-digit number ending in 5 is automatically divisible by 5, the number of favorable outcomes is equal to the number of three-digit numbers ending in 5.The total number of three-digit numbers ending in 5 can be calculated by considering the possible values for the hundreds and tens digits. The hundreds digit ( a ) can range from 1 to 9 (9 options), and the tens digit ( b ) can range from 0 to 9 (10 options). Therefore, there are ( 9 times 10 = 90 ) three-digit numbers ending in 5.Since all these 90 numbers are divisible by 5, the probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes, which is ( frac{90}{90} = 1 ).Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen three-digit number ending in 5 is divisible by 5 is 1."},{"question":"A pet store has 20 puppies, 4 kittens, and 8 hamsters.

Let me start with part (1).First, monotonicity refers to whether the function is increasing or decreasing over certain intervals. To find that, I remember that I need to look at the derivative of the function. The derivative will tell me the slope of the function at any point, so if the derivative is positive, the function is increasing, and if it's negative, the function is decreasing.So, let me compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative of e^x is e^x, the derivative of -ax is -a, and the derivative of -1 is 0. So, f'(x) = e^x - a.Now, to discuss the monotonicity, I need to analyze when f'(x) is positive, negative, or zero. Let's consider different cases for the value of a.Case 1: a ≤ 0. If a is less than or equal to zero, then -a is greater than or equal to zero. Since e^x is always positive for all real x, e^x - a will always be positive because we're subtracting a non-positive number (since a is ≤ 0). So, f'(x) > 0 for all x when a ≤ 0. That means the function f(x) is monotonically increasing everywhere.Case 2: a > 0. Now, this is more interesting because the derivative f'(x) = e^x - a can change sign depending on the value of x. Let's find when f'(x) = 0. Setting e^x - a = 0, we get e^x = a, so x = ln(a). This is the critical point where the derivative is zero.Now, let's analyze the intervals around x = ln(a). For x < ln(a), e^x < a, so f'(x) = e^x - a < 0. That means the function is decreasing on the interval (-∞, ln(a)). For x > ln(a), e^x > a, so f'(x) = e^x - a > 0, meaning the function is increasing on the interval (ln(a), ∞).So, putting it all together for a > 0, the function f(x) is decreasing on (-∞, ln(a)) and increasing on (ln(a), ∞). At x = ln(a), the function has a minimum point.Okay, that seems to cover part (1). Now, moving on to part (2). If a = 1, I need to prove that f(x) ≥ f(-x) when x ≥ 0.Let me write down f(x) and f(-x) when a = 1.f(x) = e^x - x - 1f(-x) = e^{-x} - (-x) - 1 = e^{-x} + x - 1So, I need to show that e^x - x - 1 ≥ e^{-x} + x - 1 for x ≥ 0.Let me subtract f(-x) from f(x) to see what I get:f(x) - f(-x) = (e^x - x - 1) - (e^{-x} + x - 1) = e^x - x - 1 - e^{-x} - x + 1Simplify this:e^x - e^{-x} - 2xSo, I need to show that e^x - e^{-x} - 2x ≥ 0 for x ≥ 0.Let me define a new function g(x) = e^x - e^{-x} - 2x. I need to prove that g(x) ≥ 0 for x ≥ 0.To analyze this, I can look at the derivative of g(x). Let's compute g'(x):g'(x) = d/dx [e^x - e^{-x} - 2x] = e^x + e^{-x} - 2Hmm, interesting. So, g'(x) = e^x + e^{-x} - 2.I know that e^x + e^{-x} is always greater than or equal to 2 for all real x. This is because of the AM-GM inequality: for positive numbers a and b, (a + b)/2 ≥ sqrt(ab). Letting a = e^x and b = e^{-x}, we get (e^x + e^{-x})/2 ≥ sqrt(e^x * e^{-x}) = sqrt(1) = 1. Therefore, e^x + e^{-x} ≥ 2.So, g'(x) = e^x + e^{-x} - 2 ≥ 0 for all x. That means g(x) is an increasing function for all x.Now, since g(x) is increasing, its minimum value on the interval [0, ∞) occurs at x = 0. Let's compute g(0):g(0) = e^0 - e^{-0} - 2*0 = 1 - 1 - 0 = 0.So, g(0) = 0, and since g(x) is increasing, for all x ≥ 0, g(x) ≥ g(0) = 0. Therefore, e^x - e^{-x} - 2x ≥ 0 for x ≥ 0, which implies that f(x) ≥ f(-x) for x ≥ 0.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found the derivative f'(x) = e^x - a, which seems correct.2. For a ≤ 0, f'(x) is always positive, so f(x) is increasing everywhere. That makes sense because e^x grows exponentially, and subtracting a non-positive term a keeps it increasing.3. For a > 0, solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = ln(a), which is the critical point. Then, testing intervals around ln(a) shows that f(x) is decreasing before ln(a) and increasing after. That seems right.4. For part (2), setting a = 1, I correctly wrote f(x) and f(-x), subtracted them to get g(x) = e^x - e^{-x} - 2x. Then, taking the derivative g'(x) = e^x + e^{-x} - 2, which is always non-negative because e^x + e^{-x} ≥ 2. Therefore, g(x) is increasing, and since g(0) = 0, it follows that g(x) ≥ 0 for x ≥ 0. Hence, f(x) ≥ f(-x) for x ≥ 0.I think all the steps are correct. I didn't see any errors in my reasoning.**Final Answer**(1) When ( a leq 0 ), ( f(x) ) is increasing on ( (-infty, +infty) ).

Prove that these points lie on the same circle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two parabolas whose axes are perpendicular to each other, and they intersect at four points. I need to prove that these four points lie on the same circle. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a circle is a special case of a conic section, just like a parabola. But how do I connect this?First, let me recall what a parabola is. A parabola is the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point called the focus and a fixed line called the directrix. The axis of a parabola is the line that passes through the focus and is perpendicular to the directrix. So, if two parabolas have perpendicular axes, their axes intersect at a right angle.Let me try to visualize this. Suppose one parabola opens upwards, so its axis is vertical, and the other opens to the right, so its axis is horizontal. These two parabolas should intersect at four points. I need to show that these four points lie on a circle.Maybe I can start by writing the equations of these parabolas. Let's take the first parabola with a vertical axis. Its standard equation is ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ). Similarly, the second parabola with a horizontal axis would have an equation like ( x = dy^2 + ey + f ).But wait, since the axes are perpendicular, maybe it's better to choose coordinate systems such that the axes of the parabolas align with the coordinate axes. That might simplify things. So, let me assume that the first parabola has its axis along the y-axis, so its equation is ( y = ax^2 ). Similarly, the second parabola has its axis along the x-axis, so its equation is ( x = by^2 ).Okay, so now the two equations are:1. ( y = ax^2 )2. ( x = by^2 )I need to find their points of intersection. Let me substitute equation 1 into equation 2. So, substituting ( y = ax^2 ) into equation 2, we get:( x = b(ax^2)^2 = b a^2 x^4 )So, ( x = b a^2 x^4 ). Let me rearrange this:( b a^2 x^4 - x = 0 )Factor out x:( x (b a^2 x^3 - 1) = 0 )So, the solutions are:1. ( x = 0 )2. ( b a^2 x^3 - 1 = 0 ) => ( x^3 = frac{1}{b a^2} ) => ( x = left( frac{1}{b a^2} right)^{1/3} )Wait, so for each x, there is a corresponding y. Let's compute y for each x.When ( x = 0 ), from equation 1, ( y = a(0)^2 = 0 ). So, one point is (0, 0).For the other solutions, ( x = left( frac{1}{b a^2} right)^{1/3} ). Let me denote ( k = left( frac{1}{b a^2} right)^{1/3} ). So, x = k.Then, y = a x^2 = a k^2.So, the other points are (k, a k^2). But wait, since it's a cubic equation, there should be three roots for x, but one of them is x=0, so the other two are complex? Or maybe I made a mistake.Wait, no, actually, when I substituted, I got a quartic equation in x, but I factored out x, leaving a cubic. So, the equation ( b a^2 x^3 - 1 = 0 ) has three roots, one real and two complex, or all real? Hmm, depends on the coefficients.But in reality, two parabolas with perpendicular axes should intersect at four points, so maybe I need to consider more general equations.Wait, perhaps I oversimplified by choosing the standard forms. Maybe I should consider more general parabolas.Let me think again. Let me consider two parabolas with perpendicular axes. Let me denote the first parabola as ( y = a x^2 + b x + c ) and the second as ( x = d y^2 + e y + f ). These are more general forms.To find their intersection points, I need to solve the system:1. ( y = a x^2 + b x + c )2. ( x = d y^2 + e y + f )Substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get:( x = d (a x^2 + b x + c)^2 + e (a x^2 + b x + c) + f )This will result in a quartic equation in x. A quartic equation can have up to four real roots, which correspond to the four intersection points.Now, to prove that these four points lie on a circle, I need to show that they satisfy the equation of a circle. The general equation of a circle is ( x^2 + y^2 + g x + h y + k = 0 ).So, if I can show that the four points satisfy this equation for some constants g, h, k, then they lie on a circle.Alternatively, I can use the concept that four points lie on a circle if the pairwise angles subtended by any chord are equal, or if the cross ratio is real, but that might be more complicated.Another approach is to use the concept of power of a point or radical axis, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the equation of a circle can be written as ( x^2 + y^2 + g x + h y + k = 0 ). If I can show that the quartic equation obtained from the intersection can be factored into a quadratic and another quadratic, which represents the circle, then that would prove it.But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.I remember that two conic sections intersect at four points, and if they are both parabolas, which are conic sections, then their intersection points can lie on another conic. Since a circle is a conic, maybe it's possible.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of reciprocal curves or something else.Wait, another idea: if I can find a circle equation that is satisfied by all four intersection points, then that would work. So, let me assume that the four points lie on a circle, and then try to find the equation of the circle.But how?Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the product of the equations of the two parabolas can be related to the equation of the circle.Wait, let me think. If I have two parabolas, their equations are quadratic. If I multiply them together, I get a quartic equation, which is the equation of their combined curves. But I need to relate this to a circle.Alternatively, maybe I can subtract the two equations or combine them in some way to get the equation of a circle.Wait, let me consider specific examples to get some intuition.Suppose I take two simple parabolas: one opening upwards and one opening to the right.Let me take ( y = x^2 ) and ( x = y^2 ). Let's find their intersection points.Substituting ( y = x^2 ) into ( x = y^2 ), we get ( x = (x^2)^2 = x^4 ). So, ( x^4 - x = 0 ), which factors as ( x(x^3 - 1) = 0 ). So, solutions are ( x = 0 ) and ( x^3 = 1 ) => ( x = 1 ).So, the points are (0, 0) and (1, 1). Wait, that's only two points. But the problem says four points. Hmm, maybe I need to consider more general parabolas.Wait, perhaps the standard parabolas ( y = x^2 ) and ( x = y^2 ) only intersect at two real points, but in general, two parabolas can intersect at four points.So, maybe I need to choose different parabolas. Let me try ( y = x^2 - 1 ) and ( x = y^2 - 1 ).Substituting ( y = x^2 - 1 ) into ( x = y^2 - 1 ), we get:( x = (x^2 - 1)^2 - 1 = x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 - 1 = x^4 - 2x^2 )So, ( x^4 - 2x^2 - x = 0 )Factor out x:( x(x^3 - 2x - 1) = 0 )So, x = 0, and ( x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0 )The equation ( x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0 ) can be solved. Let me try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1.Testing x=1: 1 - 2 -1 = -2 ≠ 0Testing x=-1: -1 + 2 -1 = 0. So, x = -1 is a root.So, factor it as (x + 1)(x^2 - x - 1) = 0Thus, solutions are x = -1, and x = [1 ± sqrt(5)]/2So, total solutions: x = 0, x = -1, x = [1 + sqrt(5)]/2, x = [1 - sqrt(5)]/2Thus, four points:1. x=0: y = (0)^2 -1 = -1 => (0, -1)2. x=-1: y = (-1)^2 -1 = 0 => (-1, 0)3. x = [1 + sqrt(5)]/2: y = ([1 + sqrt(5)]/2)^2 -1 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 -1 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 -1 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 -1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/24. x = [1 - sqrt(5)]/2: y = ([1 - sqrt(5)]/2)^2 -1 = (1 - 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 -1 = (6 - 2 sqrt(5))/4 -1 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2 -1 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2So, the four points are:1. (0, -1)2. (-1, 0)3. ([1 + sqrt(5)]/2, [1 + sqrt(5)]/2)4. ([1 - sqrt(5)]/2, [1 - sqrt(5)]/2)Now, I need to check if these four points lie on a circle.To check if four points lie on a circle, I can use the general equation of a circle: ( x^2 + y^2 + g x + h y + k = 0 ). If I can find constants g, h, k such that all four points satisfy this equation, then they lie on a circle.Let me plug in the four points into the circle equation and solve for g, h, k.First, point (0, -1):( 0^2 + (-1)^2 + g*0 + h*(-1) + k = 0 )Simplify:1 - h + k = 0 => -h + k = -1 ...(1)Second, point (-1, 0):( (-1)^2 + 0^2 + g*(-1) + h*0 + k = 0 )Simplify:1 - g + k = 0 => -g + k = -1 ...(2)Third, point ([1 + sqrt(5)]/2, [1 + sqrt(5)]/2):Let me denote s = [1 + sqrt(5)]/2 for simplicity.So, x = s, y = s.Plug into the circle equation:( s^2 + s^2 + g s + h s + k = 0 )Simplify:2 s^2 + (g + h) s + k = 0 ...(3)Fourth, point ([1 - sqrt(5)]/2, [1 - sqrt(5)]/2):Let me denote t = [1 - sqrt(5)]/2.Similarly, x = t, y = t.Plug into the circle equation:( t^2 + t^2 + g t + h t + k = 0 )Simplify:2 t^2 + (g + h) t + k = 0 ...(4)Now, I have four equations: (1), (2), (3), (4). Let's see if we can solve for g, h, k.From equations (1) and (2):Equation (1): -h + k = -1Equation (2): -g + k = -1So, both equations equal to -1. Therefore, -h + k = -g + k => -h = -g => h = gSo, h = g.Now, let's consider equations (3) and (4). Let me compute s and t.s = [1 + sqrt(5)]/2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.809t = [1 - sqrt(5)]/2 ≈ (-0.236)/2 ≈ -0.118But let's compute s^2 and t^2.s^2 = ([1 + sqrt(5)]/2)^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618Similarly, t^2 = ([1 - sqrt(5)]/2)^2 = (1 - 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 - 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 - 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.382So, equation (3): 2*(3 + sqrt(5))/2 + (g + h)*s + k = 0Simplify: (3 + sqrt(5)) + (g + h)*s + k = 0Similarly, equation (4): 2*(3 - sqrt(5))/2 + (g + h)*t + k = 0Simplify: (3 - sqrt(5)) + (g + h)*t + k = 0So, equations (3) and (4) become:(3 + sqrt(5)) + (g + h)*s + k = 0 ...(3a)(3 - sqrt(5)) + (g + h)*t + k = 0 ...(4a)Let me subtract equation (4a) from equation (3a):[ (3 + sqrt(5)) - (3 - sqrt(5)) ] + (g + h)*(s - t) = 0Simplify:2 sqrt(5) + (g + h)*(s - t) = 0Compute s - t:s - t = [1 + sqrt(5)]/2 - [1 - sqrt(5)]/2 = (2 sqrt(5))/2 = sqrt(5)So, 2 sqrt(5) + (g + h)*sqrt(5) = 0Factor out sqrt(5):sqrt(5)*(2 + g + h) = 0Since sqrt(5) ≠ 0, we have:2 + g + h = 0 => g + h = -2But earlier, we found that h = g. So, substituting h = g:g + g = -2 => 2g = -2 => g = -1Therefore, h = g = -1Now, from equation (1): -h + k = -1 => -(-1) + k = -1 => 1 + k = -1 => k = -2So, we have g = -1, h = -1, k = -2Therefore, the equation of the circle is:( x^2 + y^2 - x - y - 2 = 0 )Let me verify if all four points satisfy this equation.First point: (0, -1)Plug into the circle equation:0 + 1 - 0 - (-1) - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0. Yes, it satisfies.Second point: (-1, 0)Plug into the circle equation:1 + 0 - (-1) - 0 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0. Yes, it satisfies.Third point: (s, s) where s = [1 + sqrt(5)]/2Compute ( s^2 + s^2 - s - s - 2 = 2 s^2 - 2 s - 2 )We know s^2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2So, 2*(3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 s - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5)) - 2 s - 2Compute 2 s = 2*[1 + sqrt(5)]/2 = 1 + sqrt(5)So, (3 + sqrt(5)) - (1 + sqrt(5)) - 2 = 3 + sqrt(5) -1 - sqrt(5) -2 = 0. Yes, it satisfies.Fourth point: (t, t) where t = [1 - sqrt(5)]/2Compute ( t^2 + t^2 - t - t - 2 = 2 t^2 - 2 t - 2 )We know t^2 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2So, 2*(3 - sqrt(5))/2 - 2 t - 2 = (3 - sqrt(5)) - 2 t - 2Compute 2 t = 2*[1 - sqrt(5)]/2 = 1 - sqrt(5)So, (3 - sqrt(5)) - (1 - sqrt(5)) - 2 = 3 - sqrt(5) -1 + sqrt(5) -2 = 0. Yes, it satisfies.So, all four points lie on the circle ( x^2 + y^2 - x - y - 2 = 0 ).Therefore, in this specific case, the four intersection points lie on a circle. This suggests that the general case might also hold.But how can I generalize this? Let me think.Suppose I have two parabolas with perpendicular axes. Let me denote the first parabola as ( y = a x^2 + b x + c ) and the second as ( x = d y^2 + e y + f ). Their intersection points satisfy both equations.By substituting one into the other, I get a quartic equation in x (or y). The solutions to this quartic are the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) of the intersection points.Now, to show that these four points lie on a circle, I need to show that they satisfy the equation of a circle. The general equation of a circle is quadratic, so if I can express the quartic equation as a product of two quadratic equations, one of which is the circle, then that would prove it.Alternatively, since the quartic equation is obtained by combining the two parabola equations, perhaps I can manipulate these equations to form a circle equation.Wait, another idea: if I take the two parabola equations and combine them linearly, I might get the equation of a circle.Let me try this. Suppose I have:1. ( y = a x^2 + b x + c )2. ( x = d y^2 + e y + f )If I can find constants λ and μ such that λ*(equation1) + μ*(equation2) = 0 represents a circle, then the intersection points would lie on that circle.But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.Wait, another approach: the equation of a circle can be written as ( x^2 + y^2 + g x + h y + k = 0 ). If I can express this in terms of the equations of the parabolas, then maybe I can find such a circle.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the radical axis. The radical axis of two circles is the set of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. But since we're dealing with parabolas, which are not circles, this might not directly apply.Wait, another idea: since the axes of the parabolas are perpendicular, maybe the circle is related to the coordinate axes. For example, the circle might be centered at the intersection of the axes of the parabolas.In my specific example earlier, the circle was centered at (0.5, 0.5), which is the midpoint between (0,0) and (1,1), but in that case, the intersection points were symmetric.Wait, in my specific example, the circle equation was ( x^2 + y^2 - x - y - 2 = 0 ). Completing the squares:( x^2 - x + y^2 - y = 2 )( (x - 0.5)^2 - 0.25 + (y - 0.5)^2 - 0.25 = 2 )So, ( (x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 )So, the circle is centered at (0.5, 0.5) with radius sqrt(2.5).Hmm, interesting. So, the center is the midpoint between the vertices of the parabolas? Wait, in my example, the first parabola was ( y = x^2 -1 ), which has vertex at (0, -1), and the second parabola was ( x = y^2 -1 ), which has vertex at (-1, 0). The midpoint between (0, -1) and (-1, 0) is (-0.5, -0.5), which is not the center of the circle. So, that might not be the case.Alternatively, maybe the center is related to the foci of the parabolas. The focus of ( y = x^2 -1 ) is at (0, -1 + 1/(4a)) where a=1, so (0, -1 + 0.25) = (0, -0.75). Similarly, the focus of ( x = y^2 -1 ) is at (-1 + 1/(4d), 0) where d=1, so (-1 + 0.25, 0) = (-0.75, 0). The midpoint between (0, -0.75) and (-0.75, 0) is (-0.375, -0.375), which is also not the center of the circle.So, maybe the center of the circle is not directly related to the vertices or foci, but perhaps another point.Alternatively, maybe the circle is the result of some geometric transformation or reflection.Wait, another thought: since the axes are perpendicular, maybe the circle is the result of rotating one parabola by 90 degrees, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of reciprocal curves. If I take the reciprocal of the parabola equations, maybe I can get a circle.Wait, let me think algebraically. Suppose I have two parabolas:1. ( y = a x^2 + b x + c )2. ( x = d y^2 + e y + f )I can write them as:1. ( y - a x^2 - b x - c = 0 )2. ( x - d y^2 - e y - f = 0 )Now, if I consider the equation ( y - a x^2 - b x - c + lambda (x - d y^2 - e y - f) = 0 ), for some λ, this represents a combination of the two parabola equations. If I can choose λ such that this equation becomes the equation of a circle, then the intersection points would lie on that circle.So, let me set up the equation:( y - a x^2 - b x - c + lambda x - lambda d y^2 - lambda e y - lambda f = 0 )Rearrange terms:( -a x^2 - lambda d y^2 + (-b + lambda) x + (1 - lambda e) y + (-c - lambda f) = 0 )For this to be a circle, the coefficients of ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) must be equal and non-zero, and there should be no xy term.So, set:- Coefficient of ( x^2 ): -a- Coefficient of ( y^2 ): -λ dFor it to be a circle, -a = -λ d => λ = a/dAlso, there should be no xy term, which is already satisfied since there is no xy term in the equation.So, set λ = a/d.Then, the equation becomes:( -a x^2 - (a/d) d y^2 + (-b + a/d) x + (1 - (a/d) e) y + (-c - (a/d) f) = 0 )Simplify:( -a x^2 - a y^2 + (-b + a/d) x + (1 - (a e)/d) y + (-c - (a f)/d) = 0 )Divide both sides by -a:( x^2 + y^2 + left( frac{b}{a} - frac{1}{d} right) x + left( -frac{1}{a} + frac{e}{d} right) y + left( frac{c}{a} + frac{f}{d} right) = 0 )This is the equation of a circle. Therefore, the four intersection points lie on this circle.Therefore, in general, for two parabolas with perpendicular axes, their intersection points lie on a circle given by the equation above.So, this shows that the four points lie on a circle.**Final Answer**boxed{text{The four intersection points lie on a single circle.}}"},{"question":"Let P be the point on line segment overline{AB} such that AP:PB = 3:5. Then[overrightarrow{P} = t overrightarrow{A} + u overrightarrow{B}]for some constants t and u.  What is the ordered pair (t,u)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the ordered pair (t, u) such that the vector for point P is equal to t times vector A plus u times vector B. The point P is on the line segment AB, and the ratio of AP to PB is 3:5. Hmm, ratios and vectors, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when a point divides a line segment in a certain ratio, we can use the section formula to find its coordinates or, in this case, its vector representation. The section formula says that if a point P divides the segment AB in the ratio m:n, then the position vector of P can be expressed as (n*A + m*B)/(m + n). Wait, is that right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think.I think it's (m*B + n*A)/(m + n). Because if P is closer to A, then the weight on B should be less, right? So if the ratio is AP:PB = 3:5, that means P is closer to A because the segment from A to P is shorter than from P to B. So, the weight on A should be higher. So, in the section formula, it's (m*B + n*A)/(m + n), where m is the part closer to B and n is the part closer to A. So in this case, m would be 5 and n would be 3? Wait, no, hold on.Wait, the ratio AP:PB is 3:5. So AP is 3 parts and PB is 5 parts. So the total parts are 3 + 5 = 8 parts. So P divides AB such that AP is 3/8 of AB and PB is 5/8 of AB. So, in terms of vectors, how do we express P?I think the formula is P = A + (AP/AB)*(B - A). Since AP is 3/8 of AB, then P = A + (3/8)(B - A). Let me compute that. So, expanding that, P = A + (3/8)B - (3/8)A. Combining like terms, that would be (1 - 3/8)A + (3/8)B, which is (5/8)A + (3/8)B. So, that would mean t is 5/8 and u is 3/8. So the ordered pair is (5/8, 3/8). Hmm, that seems straightforward.But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Sometimes I get confused whether it's m:n or n:m. So, if AP:PB is 3:5, then AP is 3 and PB is 5. So, starting from A, moving towards B, P is 3 units away from A and 5 units away from B. So, the total length is 8 units. So, the position vector of P can be found by weighted average. Since P is closer to A, the weight on A should be higher. So, P = (5A + 3B)/8. Yes, that makes sense because 5 is the weight for A and 3 is the weight for B, and 5 + 3 = 8.Alternatively, using the section formula, if P divides AB internally in the ratio m:n, then P = (mB + nA)/(m + n). Here, m is the part near B, which is PB = 5, and n is the part near A, which is AP = 3. So, substituting m = 5 and n = 3, we get P = (5B + 3A)/8, which is the same as (3A + 5B)/8. Wait, no, that's not the same. Wait, hold on, is it (mB + nA) or (nA + mB)?Let me double-check the section formula. The section formula is: if a point P divides AB internally in the ratio m:n, then P = (nA + mB)/(m + n). So, m is the ratio part corresponding to B, and n is the ratio part corresponding to A. So, in our case, the ratio AP:PB is 3:5, so m = 5 and n = 3. Therefore, P = (3A + 5B)/(3 + 5) = (3A + 5B)/8. Wait, that contradicts what I had earlier. Earlier, I thought it was (5A + 3B)/8, but according to the section formula, it's (3A + 5B)/8.Hmm, now I'm confused. Which one is correct? Let me think about it differently. If P is closer to A, then the weight on A should be higher. So, if I have P = (3A + 5B)/8, the weight on A is 3/8 and on B is 5/8. But since P is closer to A, shouldn't the weight on A be higher? So, 5/8 on A and 3/8 on B? That would make sense because P is closer to A, so it's more influenced by A.Wait, maybe I got the section formula backwards. Let me look it up in my mind. The section formula is: if P divides AB in the ratio m:n, then P = (nA + mB)/(m + n). So, if the ratio is AP:PB = m:n, then m is the length from A to P, and n is the length from P to B. So, m = 3, n = 5. Therefore, P = (5A + 3B)/8. Yes, that makes sense because the weight on A is higher since P is closer to A.Wait, so earlier when I used the vector approach, I got P = (5/8)A + (3/8)B, which is the same as (5A + 3B)/8. So, that's consistent. So, the section formula gives the same result when applied correctly. So, the ordered pair (t, u) is (5/8, 3/8).But just to make sure, let me visualize it. Imagine the line segment AB. Point P is closer to A, dividing AB into AP:PB = 3:5. So, from A, moving 3 units towards B, and then another 5 units to reach B. So, the total length is 8 units. So, the position vector of P is A plus 3/8 of the vector AB. Vector AB is B - A. So, P = A + (3/8)(B - A) = A + (3/8)B - (3/8)A = (1 - 3/8)A + (3/8)B = (5/8)A + (3/8)B. Yep, that's the same result.Alternatively, if I think in terms of weighted averages, since P is closer to A, it's more influenced by A. So, the weight on A should be higher. So, 5/8 on A and 3/8 on B. That makes sense.Wait, another way to think about it: if t + u = 1, because P is on the line segment AB, so the coefficients should add up to 1. In our case, 5/8 + 3/8 = 1, so that checks out.Let me also consider if the ratio was reversed. If it was PB:AP = 3:5, then P would be closer to B, and the weights would be different. But in this problem, it's AP:PB = 3:5, so P is closer to A.Just to recap, the steps are:1. Understand that P divides AB in the ratio AP:PB = 3:5.2. Use the section formula: P = (nA + mB)/(m + n), where m is the ratio part near B and n is the ratio part near A.3. Substitute m = 5 and n = 3, so P = (3A + 5B)/8.4. Express this as tA + uB, so t = 3/8 and u = 5/8? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in the section formula, it's (nA + mB)/(m + n). So, n = 3 and m = 5, so P = (3A + 5B)/8. So, t = 3/8 and u = 5/8? Wait, no, that contradicts what I had earlier.Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the section formula, P = (nA + mB)/(m + n). So, if AP:PB = 3:5, then m = 5 and n = 3. So, P = (3A + 5B)/8. So, t is the coefficient of A, which is 3/8, and u is the coefficient of B, which is 5/8. But earlier, when I did the vector approach, I got t = 5/8 and u = 3/8. So, which one is correct?Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify. The section formula is: if P divides AB in the ratio m:n, then P = (nA + mB)/(m + n). So, m is the ratio part near B, and n is the ratio part near A. So, in our case, AP:PB = 3:5, so m = 5 and n = 3. Therefore, P = (3A + 5B)/8. So, t = 3/8 and u = 5/8.But earlier, when I used the vector approach, I got P = A + (3/8)(B - A) = (5/8)A + (3/8)B, which is t = 5/8 and u = 3/8. So, which one is correct?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in applying the section formula. Let me think again. If AP:PB = 3:5, then the ratio is m:n = 3:5, where m is AP and n is PB. So, in the section formula, P = (nA + mB)/(m + n). So, m = 3, n = 5. Therefore, P = (5A + 3B)/8. So, t = 5/8 and u = 3/8. That matches the vector approach.Wait, so earlier, I thought m was the part near B, but actually, m is AP and n is PB. So, m = 3, n = 5. Therefore, P = (5A + 3B)/8. So, t = 5/8 and u = 3/8. That makes sense.So, the confusion was about what m and n represent in the section formula. They represent the ratio parts corresponding to the segments AP and PB, respectively. So, m = AP = 3, n = PB = 5. Therefore, P = (nA + mB)/(m + n) = (5A + 3B)/8.Therefore, the ordered pair (t, u) is (5/8, 3/8).Just to confirm, let me think of a simple case. Suppose A is at (0,0) and B is at (8,0). Then, AP:PB = 3:5, so P should be at 3 units from A and 5 units from B. So, the coordinate of P would be 3 units from A, which is (3,0). Let's see if the formula gives the same result.Using the formula, P = (5A + 3B)/8. Substituting A = (0,0) and B = (8,0), we get P = (5*(0,0) + 3*(8,0))/8 = (0 + 24, 0 + 0)/8 = (24/8, 0) = (3,0). Perfect, that matches. So, the formula works.Alternatively, using the vector approach, P = A + (3/8)(B - A) = (0,0) + (3/8)(8,0) = (3,0). Same result.So, both methods confirm that t = 5/8 and u = 3/8. Therefore, the ordered pair is (5/8, 3/8).I think I've got it now. The key was understanding what m and n represent in the section formula and ensuring that the weights correspond correctly to the ratio given. Initially, I was confused about whether m was the part near B or near A, but clarifying that m corresponds to AP and n corresponds to PB helped me apply the formula correctly.Another way to think about it is that the weights are inversely proportional to the lengths of the segments on the other side. Since P is closer to A, it has a higher weight on A. So, the weight on A is 5/8, and on B is 3/8. That makes sense because 5 is larger than 3, so A has a bigger influence on P's position.I could also use mass point geometry to visualize this. If I imagine masses at points A and B, the mass at A would be proportional to the length PB, and the mass at B would be proportional to the length AP. So, mass at A is 5 and mass at B is 3. Therefore, the center of mass (which is point P) would be closer to the heavier mass, which is A. So, the coordinates of P would be (5A + 3B)/8, confirming the earlier result.In summary, by using both the section formula and the vector approach, as well as verifying with a simple coordinate example and mass point intuition, I've arrived at the conclusion that the ordered pair (t, u) is (5/8, 3/8). This makes sense because P is closer to A, so the coefficient for A is larger, and the coefficients add up to 1, which is consistent with P lying on the line segment AB."},{"question":"In the quadrilateral pyramid P-ABCD, the base ABCD is a rectangle, PD perp the base, and PD = AD = a. Can the planes PBA and PBC be perpendicular? Explain.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a quadrilateral pyramid P-ABCD. The base ABCD is a rectangle, and PD is perpendicular to the base. Also, PD equals AD, both being length a. The question is asking if the planes PBA and PBC can be perpendicular. Hmm, interesting.First, I need to visualize this pyramid. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. PD is perpendicular to the base, so PD is like a vertical edge from point D up to the apex P. Also, PD = AD = a, so AD is one of the sides of the rectangle, and PD is equal in length to that side.Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's consider the base ABCD as a rectangle with points labeled clockwise: A, B, C, D. PD is perpendicular from D to P, so P is directly above D at a height a. Since PD is perpendicular, the triangle PDA is a right triangle with legs PD and DA, both of length a. So, triangle PDA is an isosceles right triangle.Now, the question is about the planes PBA and PBC. Plane PBA is the plane containing points P, B, and A, and plane PBC contains points P, B, and C. We need to check if these two planes can be perpendicular.To determine if two planes are perpendicular, their normal vectors must be perpendicular. So, if I can find the normal vectors of planes PBA and PBC, and then check if their dot product is zero, that would tell me if the planes are perpendicular.Let me set up a coordinate system to make this easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0, 0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's assign coordinates as follows:- D: (0, 0, 0)- C: (b, 0, 0) because DC is another side of the rectangle, length b- B: (b, a, 0) since AB is equal to DC, so AB is length b, and AD is length a- A: (0, a, 0)Wait, hold on. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. If AD = a, then BC = a as well. So, actually, if we place D at (0, 0, 0), then A would be at (0, a, 0), B at (b, a, 0), and C at (b, 0, 0). That makes more sense because AD is vertical with length a, and DC is horizontal with length b.Now, PD is perpendicular to the base and has length a. Since D is at (0, 0, 0), P must be at (0, 0, a). So, P is directly above D at (0, 0, a).So, coordinates:- A: (0, a, 0)- B: (b, a, 0)- C: (b, 0, 0)- D: (0, 0, 0)- P: (0, 0, a)Alright, now I need to find the normal vectors of planes PBA and PBC.First, let's find the normal vector for plane PBA. Plane PBA contains points P, B, and A.Points:- P: (0, 0, a)- B: (b, a, 0)- A: (0, a, 0)To find the normal vector, I can take the cross product of two vectors lying on the plane. Let's define vectors PB and PA.Vector PB = B - P = (b, a, 0) - (0, 0, a) = (b, a, -a)Vector PA = A - P = (0, a, 0) - (0, 0, a) = (0, a, -a)Now, compute the cross product PB × PA.PB × PA = |i   j   k|             b   a   -a             0   a   -a= i*(a*(-a) - (-a)*a) - j*(b*(-a) - (-a)*0) + k*(b*a - a*0)Simplify each component:i: a*(-a) - (-a)*a = -a² + a² = 0j: -(b*(-a) - 0) = -(-ab) = abk: b*a - 0 = abSo, PB × PA = (0, ab, ab)Therefore, the normal vector n1 for plane PBA is (0, ab, ab). We can simplify this by dividing by ab (since direction is what matters for normal vectors), so n1 = (0, 1, 1).Now, let's find the normal vector for plane PBC. Plane PBC contains points P, B, and C.Points:- P: (0, 0, a)- B: (b, a, 0)- C: (b, 0, 0)Again, take vectors PB and PC.Vector PB = B - P = (b, a, 0) - (0, 0, a) = (b, a, -a)Vector PC = C - P = (b, 0, 0) - (0, 0, a) = (b, 0, -a)Compute the cross product PB × PC.PB × PC = |i   j   k|             b   a   -a             b   0   -a= i*(a*(-a) - (-a)*0) - j*(b*(-a) - (-a)*b) + k*(b*0 - a*b)Simplify each component:i: a*(-a) - 0 = -a²j: -(b*(-a) - (-a)*b) = -(-ab + ab) = -0 = 0k: 0 - ab = -abSo, PB × PC = (-a², 0, -ab)Therefore, the normal vector n2 for plane PBC is (-a², 0, -ab). We can factor out -a to simplify: n2 = (-a, 0, -b). Alternatively, we can write it as (a, 0, b) by multiplying by -1, but direction matters, so we'll keep it as (-a, 0, -b).Now, to check if the planes are perpendicular, we need to check if their normal vectors are perpendicular. That is, the dot product of n1 and n2 should be zero.Compute n1 • n2:n1 = (0, 1, 1)n2 = (-a, 0, -b)Dot product = 0*(-a) + 1*0 + 1*(-b) = 0 + 0 - b = -bFor the planes to be perpendicular, this dot product must be zero. So, -b = 0, which implies b = 0.But b is the length DC of the rectangle. If b = 0, then the rectangle collapses into a line, which is not possible because ABCD is a rectangle, meaning it must have positive area. Therefore, b cannot be zero.Hence, the dot product is -b, which is not zero for any valid rectangle (b > 0). Therefore, the normal vectors are not perpendicular, which means the planes PBA and PBC cannot be perpendicular.Wait, but hold on. Did I make a mistake in the direction of the normal vectors? Because sometimes the cross product can give a normal vector in the opposite direction, but the direction shouldn't affect the perpendicularity since we're just checking the dot product. Let me double-check.n1 is (0, 1, 1) and n2 is (-a, 0, -b). The dot product is indeed 0*(-a) + 1*0 + 1*(-b) = -b. So, unless b = 0, which is impossible, the dot product can't be zero. Therefore, the planes cannot be perpendicular.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the other normal vector for plane PBC by taking a different cross product. Let me try that.Instead of taking PB × PC, maybe I should take PC × PB. Let's see:PC × PB = |i   j   k|             b   0   -a             b   a   -a= i*(0*(-a) - (-a)*a) - j*(b*(-a) - (-a)*b) + k*(b*a - 0*b)Simplify:i: 0 - (-a²) = a²j: -( -ab - (-ab) ) = -0 = 0k: ab - 0 = abSo, PC × PB = (a², 0, ab). Therefore, normal vector n2 = (a², 0, ab). If we factor out a, it's (a, 0, b). So, n2 = (a, 0, b).Now, compute n1 • n2:n1 = (0, 1, 1)n2 = (a, 0, b)Dot product = 0*a + 1*0 + 1*b = 0 + 0 + b = bAgain, for perpendicularity, we need b = 0, which is impossible. So, regardless of the direction of the normal vector, the dot product is either -b or b, neither of which can be zero unless b = 0, which is not allowed.Therefore, the planes PBA and PBC cannot be perpendicular.Wait, but the problem says \\"Can the planes PBA and PBC be perpendicular?\\" So, according to my calculations, no, they cannot be perpendicular because the dot product of their normal vectors is equal to b, which is non-zero. Therefore, the planes are not perpendicular.But let me think again. Maybe there's a different approach. Perhaps using vectors from the origin or something else.Alternatively, maybe using coordinates, I can find the equations of the planes and then compute their normals.Equation of plane PBA: It contains points P(0,0,a), B(b,a,0), and A(0,a,0).We can find two vectors on the plane:PB = (b, a, -a)PA = (0, a, -a)As before, cross product PB × PA gives the normal vector (0, ab, ab). So, equation of the plane is 0(x - 0) + ab(y - 0) + ab(z - a) = 0.Simplify: ab y + ab z - a² b = 0 => y + z = a.Similarly, equation of plane PBC: contains points P(0,0,a), B(b,a,0), and C(b,0,0).Vectors PB = (b, a, -a) and PC = (b, 0, -a).Cross product PB × PC = (-a², 0, -ab). So, equation of the plane is -a²(x - 0) + 0(y - 0) - ab(z - a) = 0.Simplify: -a² x - ab z + a² b = 0 => a² x + ab z = a² b => Divide both sides by a: a x + b z = a b.So, equations of the planes:Plane PBA: y + z = aPlane PBC: a x + b z = a bNow, to find if these planes are perpendicular, their normal vectors must be perpendicular. The normal vector of PBA is (0,1,1) and the normal vector of PBC is (a,0,b). The dot product is 0*a + 1*0 + 1*b = b ≠ 0. Therefore, the planes are not perpendicular.Alternatively, if I consider the normal vectors as (0,1,1) and (a,0,b), their dot product is b, which is not zero. So, unless b=0, which is impossible, the planes cannot be perpendicular.Therefore, the answer is no, the planes PBA and PBC cannot be perpendicular.But wait, the problem says \\"Can the planes PBA and PBC be perpendicular?\\" So, is it possible under some conditions? Maybe if b is zero, but as we saw, b cannot be zero because ABCD is a rectangle, so sides must have positive length.Alternatively, is there a different configuration where PD is not directly above D? Wait, no, PD is perpendicular to the base, so P must be directly above D.Alternatively, maybe if the rectangle is a square, but even if b = a, then the dot product would be a, which is still not zero.So, regardless of the values of a and b (as long as they are positive), the dot product is b, which is non-zero. Therefore, the planes cannot be perpendicular.Hence, the answer is no, the planes PBA and PBC cannot be perpendicular.**Final Answer**boxed{text{No}}"},{"question":"Calculate the total sum of all natural-number divisors of a number M, where M = 2^2 cdot 3^1 cdot 7^2.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the total sum of all natural-number divisors of a number M, where M is given as 2 squared times 3 to the first power times 7 squared. Hmm, that sounds like prime factorization. I remember that to find the sum of divisors, there's a formula involving the prime factors. Let me try to recall how that works.First, I think the formula is something like for each prime factor, you take the sum of its powers from 0 up to the exponent in the prime factorization, and then multiply all these sums together. So, if M is 2² × 3¹ × 7², then for each prime, I need to calculate the sum of their respective powers.Starting with the prime number 2, which has an exponent of 2. So, the sum for 2 would be 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2². Let me compute that: 1 + 2 + 4, which equals 7. Okay, that seems right.Next, the prime number 3 has an exponent of 1. So, the sum for 3 would be 3⁰ + 3¹. That would be 1 + 3, which equals 4. Simple enough.Then, the prime number 7 has an exponent of 2. So, the sum for 7 would be 7⁰ + 7¹ + 7². Calculating that: 1 + 7 + 49, which adds up to 57. Hmm, that's a bit bigger, but it makes sense since 7 squared is 49.Now, I think I need to multiply these sums together to get the total sum of all divisors. So, that would be 7 (from 2) multiplied by 4 (from 3) multiplied by 57 (from 7). Let me do that step by step.First, 7 multiplied by 4 is 28. Then, 28 multiplied by 57. Hmm, let me calculate that. 28 times 50 is 1400, and 28 times 7 is 196. Adding those together, 1400 + 196 equals 1596. So, the total sum of all divisors of M is 1596.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the sum of divisors formula, I believe I applied it correctly. Each prime's sum of powers was calculated accurately: 1+2+4=7, 1+3=4, and 1+7+49=57. Multiplying them together: 7×4=28, and 28×57=1596. Yep, that seems correct.I guess another way to verify is to list out all the divisors and add them up, but that might take a while since there are quite a few divisors. Let me see, the number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1)(2+1)=3×2×3=18 divisors. That's a lot, but maybe I can list them in groups.Starting with 1, which is always a divisor. Then, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 14, 12, 21, 28, 42, 49, 84, 98, 147, 196, 294, 588, and 1176. Wait, that's 18 divisors. Now, adding them all up: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 14 + 12 + 21 + 28 + 42 + 49 + 84 + 98 + 147 + 196 + 294 + 588 + 1176.Let me add them step by step:1 + 2 = 33 + 3 = 66 + 4 = 1010 + 7 = 1717 + 6 = 2323 + 14 = 3737 + 12 = 4949 + 21 = 7070 + 28 = 9898 + 42 = 140140 + 49 = 189189 + 84 = 273273 + 98 = 371371 + 147 = 518518 + 196 = 714714 + 294 = 10081008 + 588 = 15961596 + 1176 = 2772Wait, that's not matching my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my addition again.Wait, when I added all the divisors, I ended up with 2772, which is different from 1596. That means I probably made an error in listing the divisors or in adding them up. Let me try to list the divisors again more carefully.Given M = 2² × 3¹ × 7², the exponents for 2 are 0,1,2; for 3 are 0,1; and for 7 are 0,1,2. So, all possible combinations are:2⁰ × 3⁰ × 7⁰ = 12⁰ × 3⁰ × 7¹ = 72⁰ × 3⁰ × 7² = 492⁰ × 3¹ × 7⁰ = 32⁰ × 3¹ × 7¹ = 212⁰ × 3¹ × 7² = 1472¹ × 3⁰ × 7⁰ = 22¹ × 3⁰ × 7¹ = 142¹ × 3⁰ × 7² = 982¹ × 3¹ × 7⁰ = 62¹ × 3¹ × 7¹ = 422¹ × 3¹ × 7² = 2942² × 3⁰ × 7⁰ = 42² × 3⁰ × 7¹ = 282² × 3⁰ × 7² = 1962² × 3¹ × 7⁰ = 122² × 3¹ × 7¹ = 842² × 3¹ × 7² = 588So, that's 18 divisors. Now, let's list them in order:1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 49, 84, 98, 147, 196, 294, 588.Wait, that's 18 divisors. Now, let me add them up again:1 + 2 = 33 + 3 = 66 + 4 = 1010 + 6 = 1616 + 7 = 2323 + 12 = 3535 + 14 = 4949 + 21 = 7070 + 28 = 9898 + 42 = 140140 + 49 = 189189 + 84 = 273273 + 98 = 371371 + 147 = 518518 + 196 = 714714 + 294 = 10081008 + 588 = 1596Okay, now I get 1596 when adding the divisors. So, my initial mistake was probably in listing the divisors incorrectly the first time. Now, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.So, using the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^k) × (1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^k) × ... for each prime factor, I correctly calculated the sum as 7 × 4 × 57 = 1596. And when I listed all the divisors and added them up, I also got 1596. Therefore, I'm confident that the total sum of all natural-number divisors of M is 1596."},{"question":"Find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 3cos{2x}, where x in mathbb{R}, and the range of x when f(x) reaches its maximum value.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = 3cos(2x), and I need to find its maximum value and the range of x where this maximum occurs. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the cosine function, cos(θ), has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. So, if I have cos(2x), its maximum will still be 1, right? But here, it's multiplied by 3, so the maximum value should be 3*1 = 3. That seems straightforward.But wait, let me make sure. The general form of a cosine function is A*cos(Bx + C) + D, where A is the amplitude, B affects the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, our function is 3cos(2x), so A is 3, B is 2, and there's no phase shift or vertical shift. So, the amplitude is 3, which means the maximum value is 3 and the minimum is -3. So, yes, the maximum value of f(x) is indeed 3.Now, I need to find the range of x where f(x) reaches this maximum value. That means I need to solve the equation 3cos(2x) = 3. Let me write that down:3cos(2x) = 3If I divide both sides by 3, I get:cos(2x) = 1Okay, so when does cos(θ) equal 1? I remember that cos(0) = 1, and cosine has a period of 2π, so it repeats every 2π. Therefore, the general solution for cos(θ) = 1 is θ = 2πk, where k is any integer. In this case, θ is 2x, so:2x = 2πkTo solve for x, I divide both sides by 2:x = πkSo, x equals π times any integer k. That means the function f(x) reaches its maximum value of 3 at all x values that are integer multiples of π.Let me check if this makes sense. If I plug x = 0 into f(x), I get 3cos(0) = 3*1 = 3. If I plug x = π, I get 3cos(2π) = 3*1 = 3. Similarly, x = -π gives 3cos(-2π) = 3*1 = 3. So, it works for positive, negative, and zero integers. That seems consistent.I also remember that the period of cos(2x) is π because the period of cos(Bx) is 2π/B. Here, B is 2, so the period is π. That means the function repeats every π units. So, the maximum occurs every π units, which aligns with x = πk.Wait, let me visualize the graph of f(x) = 3cos(2x). It's a cosine wave with an amplitude of 3 and a period of π. So, it starts at 3 when x=0, goes down to -3 at x=π/2, back to 3 at x=π, and so on. So, the peaks are at x=0, π, 2π, etc., and also at x=-π, -2π, etc. So, indeed, the maximum occurs at x = πk for any integer k.Is there any other point where cos(2x) equals 1 besides 2x = 2πk? Let me think. Cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, but it only equals 1 at multiples of 2π. So, no, there are no other solutions. Therefore, x = πk is the complete set of solutions where f(x) reaches its maximum.Just to be thorough, let me test another value. Let's say k=1, so x=π. Then f(π) = 3cos(2π) = 3*1 = 3. If k=2, x=2π, f(2π)=3cos(4π)=3*1=3. Similarly, for k=-1, x=-π, f(-π)=3cos(-2π)=3*1=3. So, it holds for positive, negative, and zero integers.I think I've covered all the bases here. The maximum value is 3, and it occurs at all real numbers x where x is an integer multiple of π. So, the range of x is x = πk, where k is any integer.**Final Answer**The maximum value of the function is boxed{3}, and it occurs when ( x = kpi ) for any integer ( k )."},{"question":"Given ageqslant 0, bgeqslant 0, prove that: a^{6}+b^{6}geqslant ab(a^{4}+b^{4}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality to prove: given that a and b are both greater than or equal to zero, I need to show that a⁶ + b⁶ is greater than or equal to ab times (a⁴ + b⁴). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should probably write down the inequality to make it clear:a⁶ + b⁶ ≥ ab(a⁴ + b⁴)Alright, so I need to show that the left side is at least as big as the right side for all non-negative a and b. Maybe I can rearrange the inequality to see if it simplifies into something more manageable.Let me subtract ab(a⁴ + b⁴) from both sides to get:a⁶ + b⁶ - ab(a⁴ + b⁴) ≥ 0Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me see if I can factor the left side.Looking at a⁶ and b⁶, those are both sixth powers, and ab(a⁴ + b⁴) is a product of a, b, and the sum of fourth powers. Maybe I can factor the expression a⁶ + b⁶ - ab(a⁴ + b⁴).Let me try to factor it. I notice that a⁶ - ab(a⁴) is a⁶ - a⁵b, and similarly, b⁶ - ab(b⁴) is b⁶ - ab⁵. So, the expression becomes:a⁶ - a⁵b + b⁶ - ab⁵Hmm, that's a⁶ - a⁵b + b⁶ - ab⁵. Maybe I can factor this expression by grouping terms.Looking at the first two terms: a⁶ - a⁵b. I can factor out an a⁵, which gives me a⁵(a - b). Similarly, the last two terms: b⁶ - ab⁵. I can factor out a b⁵, which gives me b⁵(b - a). So, putting it all together:a⁵(a - b) + b⁵(b - a)Wait, notice that (b - a) is the same as -(a - b). So, I can rewrite the second term as -b⁵(a - b). So, now the expression becomes:a⁵(a - b) - b⁵(a - b)Now, I can factor out (a - b) from both terms:(a - b)(a⁵ - b⁵)Okay, so the expression a⁶ + b⁶ - ab(a⁴ + b⁴) factors into (a - b)(a⁵ - b⁵). That's a good start.Now, I need to analyze the sign of this expression. Since a and b are non-negative, let's consider two cases: when a is greater than or equal to b, and when a is less than b.Case 1: a ≥ bIn this case, since a is greater than or equal to b, (a - b) is non-negative. Also, since a ≥ b and both are non-negative, a⁵ ≥ b⁵ because raising to the fifth power preserves the inequality. So, (a⁵ - b⁵) is also non-negative.Multiplying two non-negative numbers gives a non-negative result. Therefore, (a - b)(a⁵ - b⁵) ≥ 0. So, the original expression a⁶ + b⁶ - ab(a⁴ + b⁴) is non-negative, which means a⁶ + b⁶ ≥ ab(a⁴ + b⁴).Case 2: a < bIn this scenario, (a - b) is negative because a is less than b. Similarly, since a < b, a⁵ < b⁵, so (a⁵ - b⁵) is also negative.Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. Therefore, (a - b)(a⁵ - b⁵) > 0, which again means that a⁶ + b⁶ - ab(a⁴ + b⁴) > 0, so a⁶ + b⁶ > ab(a⁴ + b⁴).Wait, hold on a second. In the first case, we have a ≥ b leading to the expression being non-negative, and in the second case, a < b leading to the expression being positive. So, in both cases, the expression is non-negative, which is exactly what we needed to prove.But let me double-check my factoring to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from a⁶ + b⁶ - ab(a⁴ + b⁴), I subtracted ab(a⁴ + b⁴) to get a⁶ - a⁵b + b⁶ - ab⁵. Then, I grouped them as (a⁶ - a⁵b) + (b⁶ - ab⁵), factored out a⁵ and b⁵ respectively, which gave me a⁵(a - b) + b⁵(b - a). Then, recognizing that (b - a) is -(a - b), I rewrote it as a⁵(a - b) - b⁵(a - b), which factors into (a - b)(a⁵ - b⁵). That seems correct.Another way to think about this might be to use the AM-GM inequality or some other inequality, but factoring seems straightforward here. Alternatively, maybe I can consider dividing both sides by ab, assuming a and b are positive, but since a and b can be zero, I have to be careful.Wait, if a or b is zero, let's check that case. Suppose a = 0, then the inequality becomes 0 + b⁶ ≥ 0*(0⁴ + b⁴), which simplifies to b⁶ ≥ 0, which is true because b is non-negative. Similarly, if b = 0, the inequality becomes a⁶ + 0 ≥ a*0*(a⁴ + 0), which is a⁶ ≥ 0, also true. So, the cases where either a or b is zero are handled.What if a = b? Then, plugging into the inequality: a⁶ + a⁶ ≥ a*a(a⁴ + a⁴), which simplifies to 2a⁶ ≥ a²*(2a⁴) = 2a⁶. So, 2a⁶ ≥ 2a⁶, which is equality. So, the inequality holds as equality when a = b.So, all cases seem to be covered. The factoring approach worked well, and considering the two cases based on the relationship between a and b allowed me to show that the expression is always non-negative.I think this proof is solid. I don't see any mistakes in the logic or calculations. The key was factoring the expression into (a - b)(a⁵ - b⁵) and then analyzing the sign based on whether a is greater than or less than b.**Final Answer**The inequality is proven, and the result is boxed{a^{6} + b^{6} geqslant ab(a^{4} + b^{4})}."},{"question":"Two positive numbers (x) and (y) are in the ratio (2:5).

Let me take them one at a time. The first one is ( x^2 - 3x = 0 ). Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation, but it's not in the standard form. I remember that quadratic equations are usually written as ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ). So, in this case, it's already almost there, except there's no constant term. Maybe I can factor this equation. Factoring is when you take out common terms from each part of the equation. Looking at ( x^2 - 3x ), I see that both terms have an ( x ) in them. So, I can factor out an ( x ), which would give me ( x(x - 3) = 0 ). Now, I remember something called the Zero Product Property, which says that if the product of two things is zero, then at least one of them has to be zero. So, in this case, either ( x = 0 ) or ( x - 3 = 0 ). Solving those, if ( x = 0 ), that's one solution. If ( x - 3 = 0 ), then ( x = 3 ). So, the solutions are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 3 ). Wait, let me double-check that. If I plug ( x = 0 ) back into the original equation, I get ( 0^2 - 3*0 = 0 ), which is true. If I plug in ( x = 3 ), I get ( 3^2 - 3*3 = 9 - 9 = 0 ), which is also true. Okay, so that seems right.Now, moving on to the second equation: ( 5x + 2 = 3x^2 ). This one looks a bit more complicated. Again, it's a quadratic equation, but it's not set to zero. I think I need to rearrange it so that it equals zero. Let me subtract ( 5x ) and subtract ( 2 ) from both sides to get everything on one side. That would give me ( 3x^2 - 5x - 2 = 0 ).Alright, now it's in the standard quadratic form. I need to solve for ( x ). I can try factoring again, but I'm not sure if this quadratic factors nicely. Let me see. The quadratic is ( 3x^2 - 5x - 2 ). To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to ( 3*(-2) = -6 ) and add up to ( -5 ). Hmm, let's think. What two numbers multiply to -6 and add to -5? Well, 1 and -6 multiply to -6, but they add to -5. Wait, 1 and -6 add to -5? Let me check: 1 + (-6) = -5. Yes, that's correct. So, I can use these numbers to break down the middle term. So, I'll rewrite the quadratic as ( 3x^2 + x - 6x - 2 = 0 ). Now, I can factor by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:( (3x^2 + x) + (-6x - 2) = 0 )Factor out the greatest common factor from each group:From ( 3x^2 + x ), I can factor out an ( x ), giving ( x(3x + 1) ).From ( -6x - 2 ), I can factor out a -2, giving ( -2(3x + 1) ).So now, the equation looks like:( x(3x + 1) - 2(3x + 1) = 0 )I notice that both terms have a common factor of ( (3x + 1) ), so I can factor that out:( (3x + 1)(x - 2) = 0 )Now, using the Zero Product Property again, either ( 3x + 1 = 0 ) or ( x - 2 = 0 ).Solving these:1. ( 3x + 1 = 0 )     Subtract 1: ( 3x = -1 )     Divide by 3: ( x = -frac{1}{3} )2. ( x - 2 = 0 )     Add 2: ( x = 2 )So, the solutions are ( x = -frac{1}{3} ) and ( x = 2 ).Let me verify these solutions by plugging them back into the original equation ( 5x + 2 = 3x^2 ).First, ( x = -frac{1}{3} ):Left side: ( 5*(-frac{1}{3}) + 2 = -frac{5}{3} + 2 = -frac{5}{3} + frac{6}{3} = frac{1}{3} )Right side: ( 3*(-frac{1}{3})^2 = 3*(frac{1}{9}) = frac{1}{3} )They match, so that's correct.Next, ( x = 2 ):Left side: ( 5*2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12 )Right side: ( 3*(2)^2 = 3*4 = 12 )They also match, so that's correct.Okay, so both solutions work. I think I've got it right.Just to recap:1. For ( x^2 - 3x = 0 ), factoring gives ( x(x - 3) = 0 ), so ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 3 ).2. For ( 5x + 2 = 3x^2 ), rearranging gives ( 3x^2 - 5x - 2 = 0 ), which factors to ( (3x + 1)(x - 2) = 0 ), leading to ( x = -frac{1}{3} ) or ( x = 2 ).I think that's all. I didn't make any mistakes this time, right? Wait, let me check the factoring step again for the second equation. I had ( 3x^2 - 5x - 2 ), and I broke it down into ( 3x^2 + x - 6x - 2 ). Then factoring gave me ( (3x + 1)(x - 2) ). Multiplying those out: ( 3x*x = 3x^2 ), ( 3x*(-2) = -6x ), ( 1*x = x ), ( 1*(-2) = -2 ). Combine like terms: ( 3x^2 -6x + x -2 = 3x^2 -5x -2 ). Yep, that's correct. So, no mistakes there.Alright, I'm confident with these solutions."},{"question":"Given that cos(alpha) = -frac{3}{5} and alpha is an angle in the third quadrant, find the value of cos(frac{pi}{4} + alpha) (   ).A: frac{sqrt{2}}{10}B: -frac{sqrt{2}}{10}C: frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}D: -frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometry problem here. It says that cos(α) is -3/5, and α is an angle in the third quadrant. I need to find the value of cos(π/4 + α). The options are given as A: √2/10, B: -√2/10, C: 7√2/10, and D: -7√2/10.Alright, let me start by recalling some trigonometric identities. I remember that there's a formula for the cosine of a sum of two angles. It goes like this: cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. So, in this case, A is π/4 and B is α. That means I can write cos(π/4 + α) as cos(π/4)cos(α) - sin(π/4)sin(α).I know the values of cos(π/4) and sin(π/4). Both are equal to √2/2. So, substituting those in, the expression becomes (√2/2)cos(α) - (√2/2)sin(α).Now, I already know that cos(α) is -3/5. But I don't know sin(α). Since α is in the third quadrant, I remember that both sine and cosine are negative there. So, sin(α) should also be negative. To find sin(α), I can use the Pythagorean identity: sin²(α) + cos²(α) = 1.Let me plug in cos(α) = -3/5 into this identity. So, sin²(α) + (-3/5)² = 1. That simplifies to sin²(α) + 9/25 = 1. Subtracting 9/25 from both sides gives sin²(α) = 1 - 9/25, which is 16/25. Taking the square root of both sides, sin(α) = ±4/5. But since α is in the third quadrant, sin(α) is negative. Therefore, sin(α) = -4/5.Okay, so now I have both cos(α) and sin(α). Let me substitute these back into the expression for cos(π/4 + α). That gives me:cos(π/4 + α) = (√2/2)(-3/5) - (√2/2)(-4/5).Let me compute each term separately. First term: (√2/2)(-3/5) = (-3√2)/10. Second term: (√2/2)(-4/5) = (-4√2)/10, but since it's subtracted, it becomes +4√2/10.So, combining these two terms: (-3√2)/10 + (4√2)/10. That simplifies to (1√2)/10, which is √2/10.Wait a minute, but let me double-check my signs. The first term is negative, and the second term is positive because of the double negative. So, adding them together, it's (-3√2 + 4√2)/10, which is indeed √2/10.Looking at the options, that's option A. But hold on, I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through it again.Starting with cos(α) = -3/5, third quadrant, so sin(α) is -4/5. Then, using the sum formula:cos(π/4 + α) = cos(π/4)cos(α) - sin(π/4)sin(α)= (√2/2)(-3/5) - (√2/2)(-4/5)= (-3√2)/10 + (4√2)/10= (√2)/10.Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, the angle π/4 + α, where α is in the third quadrant. Let me think about the quadrant where π/4 + α would lie. If α is in the third quadrant, say between π and 3π/2, then adding π/4 would make it between 5π/4 and 7π/4, which is still in the third and fourth quadrants. But cos(π/4 + α) is positive, which would mean that π/4 + α is in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive. Wait, but I got a positive value, √2/10, which is positive, so that makes sense if π/4 + α is in the fourth quadrant.But let me check if I considered the correct signs for sine and cosine. Since α is in the third quadrant, both sine and cosine are negative, which I accounted for. So, sin(α) is -4/5, cos(α) is -3/5. Plugging into the formula, I get positive √2/10. So, that should be correct.Wait, but let me think again about the angle addition. If α is in the third quadrant, say around π + θ, then π/4 + α would be π/4 + π + θ = 5π/4 + θ, which is still in the third quadrant, but maybe beyond. Wait, no, 5π/4 is already in the third quadrant, and adding θ would take it further, but cosine is negative in the third quadrant. Wait, but I got a positive value. That seems contradictory.Hold on, maybe I made a mistake in determining the quadrant of π/4 + α. Let me think. If α is in the third quadrant, say between π and 3π/2, then π/4 + α would be between π + π/4 = 5π/4 and 3π/2 + π/4 = 7π/4. So, 5π/4 to 7π/4. That spans from the third quadrant to the fourth quadrant. So, depending on the exact value of α, π/4 + α could be in the third or fourth quadrant.But since cos(π/4 + α) is positive, that would mean that π/4 + α is in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the positive value is correct.Wait, but let me check my calculation again. Maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me go through it step by step.cos(π/4 + α) = cos(π/4)cos(α) - sin(π/4)sin(α)= (√2/2)(-3/5) - (√2/2)(-4/5)= (-3√2)/10 - (-4√2)/10= (-3√2)/10 + 4√2/10= (1√2)/10= √2/10.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be √2/10, which is option A.But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when angles are added, the quadrant can affect the sign, but in this case, since we're calculating the cosine directly, and we've accounted for the signs of sine and cosine in the third quadrant, the result should be correct.Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify. Let me think about the unit circle. If α is in the third quadrant with cos(α) = -3/5, then the coordinates are (-3/5, -4/5). Adding π/4 to α would rotate this point by 45 degrees. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for cosine of sum and see if I can represent it differently. But I think the initial approach is correct.Wait, another thought: sometimes, when dealing with angle additions, people use the formula cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up sine and cosine terms. Let me confirm the formula. Yes, it's cos A cos B - sin A sin B. So, I think I applied it correctly.So, after carefully going through the steps, I believe the correct answer is √2/10, which is option A."},{"question":"The region consisting of all points in three-dimensional space within 4 units of line segment overline{CD} has volume 544pi.

What is the length CD?\\" The options are given as A. 82/3, B. 86/3, C. 90/3, D. 94/3. Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to visualize what this region looks like. The problem says it's all points within 4 units of the line segment CD. Hmm, in three-dimensional space, if I consider all points within a certain distance from a line segment, that should form a cylinder, right? Because every point within 4 units from the line segment would form a circular cylinder around it. But wait, actually, it's not just a simple cylinder because at the ends of the line segment, the region would also include hemispheres. So, the entire shape is like a cylinder with two hemispherical caps on either end. This is sometimes called a \\"spherical cylinder\\" or a \\"cylinder with hemispherical ends.\\"So, the total volume of this region would be the volume of the cylinder plus the volume of the two hemispheres. Since two hemispheres make up a full sphere, I can think of it as the volume of the cylinder plus the volume of a sphere.Let me write that down:Total Volume = Volume of Cylinder + Volume of SphereI know the formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length, in this case). The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³.Given that the radius is 4 units, let's plug that in.Volume of Cylinder = π*(4)²*L, where L is the length of the line segment CD.Volume of Sphere = (4/3)π*(4)³So, the total volume is:Total Volume = π*16*L + (4/3)π*64Simplify that:Total Volume = 16πL + (256/3)πThe problem states that this total volume is 544π. So, I can set up the equation:16πL + (256/3)π = 544πHmm, okay, let's solve for L. First, I can factor out π from all terms:π*(16L + 256/3) = π*544Divide both sides by π to simplify:16L + 256/3 = 544Now, I need to solve for L. Let me subtract 256/3 from both sides:16L = 544 - 256/3To subtract these, I need a common denominator. 544 can be written as 544/1, so to get a denominator of 3, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 3:544 = 544*3/3 = 1632/3So, 16L = 1632/3 - 256/3 = (1632 - 256)/3Calculate 1632 - 256:1632 - 256 = 1376So, 16L = 1376/3Now, solve for L by dividing both sides by 16:L = (1376/3) / 16Divide 1376 by 16:1376 ÷ 16 = 86So, L = 86/3Therefore, the length CD is 86/3 units.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the total volume:16πL + (256/3)π = 544πSubtract (256/3)π from both sides:16πL = 544π - (256/3)πFactor out π:16πL = π*(544 - 256/3)Divide both sides by π:16L = 544 - 256/3Convert 544 to thirds:544 = 1632/3So, 16L = 1632/3 - 256/3 = 1376/3Divide both sides by 16:L = (1376/3) / 16 = 1376/(3*16) = 1376/48Simplify 1376/48:Divide numerator and denominator by 16:1376 ÷ 16 = 8648 ÷ 16 = 3So, 86/3. Yep, that checks out.So, the length CD is 86/3, which is option B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Caroline can make thirteen lassis out of three mangoes.

It's divided into two parts. Let me try to tackle them one by one.Starting with part (1): When a = 2, solve the inequality f(x) ≤ 6. The function f(x) is given as |2x - a| + a. So, substituting a = 2, f(x) becomes |2x - 2| + 2. I need to solve |2x - 2| + 2 ≤ 6.Hmm, let me rewrite that inequality. Subtract 2 from both sides: |2x - 2| ≤ 4. That simplifies things a bit. Now, I can think of this as the distance between 2x and 2 being at most 4. To solve this, I can break it into two inequalities: -4 ≤ 2x - 2 ≤ 4.Let me solve each part separately. Starting with the left inequality: -4 ≤ 2x - 2. Adding 2 to both sides gives -2 ≤ 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, I get -1 ≤ x.Now the right inequality: 2x - 2 ≤ 4. Adding 2 to both sides gives 2x ≤ 6. Dividing both sides by 2, I get x ≤ 3.So combining both results, x must be between -1 and 3. Therefore, the solution set is all real numbers x such that -1 ≤ x ≤ 3. I think that's it for part (1).Moving on to part (2): We have another function g(x) = |2x - 1|. The condition is that for all real numbers x, f(x) + g(x) ≥ 3. We need to find the range of values for a.First, let me write down f(x) + g(x). f(x) is |2x - a| + a, and g(x) is |2x - 1|. So adding them together: |2x - a| + a + |2x - 1|.Hmm, that's |2x - a| + |2x - 1| + a. Maybe I can factor out the 2 from the absolute value terms. Let's see: |2x - a| can be written as 2|x - a/2|, and similarly |2x - 1| is 2|x - 1/2|. So substituting back, the expression becomes 2|x - a/2| + 2|x - 1/2| + a.I can factor out the 2: 2(|x - a/2| + |x - 1/2|) + a. So the inequality is 2(|x - a/2| + |x - 1/2|) + a ≥ 3.Let me divide both sides by 2 to simplify: |x - a/2| + |x - 1/2| ≥ (3 - a)/2.Now, I need this inequality to hold for all real numbers x. So, the left side is the sum of two absolute values, which is always non-negative. The right side is (3 - a)/2. For the inequality to hold for all x, the right side must be less than or equal to the minimum value of the left side.What's the minimum value of |x - a/2| + |x - 1/2|? I remember that the sum of two absolute values like |x - c| + |x - d| has a minimum value equal to |c - d|. So, in this case, the minimum value is |a/2 - 1/2|.So, the minimum of |x - a/2| + |x - 1/2| is |(a - 1)/2|. Therefore, the inequality becomes |(a - 1)/2| ≥ (3 - a)/2.Let me write that down: |(a - 1)/2| ≥ (3 - a)/2.Now, let's analyze this inequality. The left side is an absolute value, so it's always non-negative. The right side is (3 - a)/2. So, for the inequality to hold, the right side must be less than or equal to the left side.But let's consider two cases based on the value of a.Case 1: a ≥ 3.If a is greater than or equal to 3, then (3 - a)/2 is less than or equal to zero. Since the left side is an absolute value (which is non-negative), the inequality |(a - 1)/2| ≥ (3 - a)/2 will always hold because a non-negative number is always greater than or equal to a non-positive number.Case 2: a < 3.In this case, (3 - a)/2 is positive. So, the inequality becomes |(a - 1)/2| ≥ (3 - a)/2.Let me drop the denominators since they are positive and won't affect the inequality: |a - 1| ≥ 3 - a.Now, let's solve |a - 1| ≥ 3 - a.Again, let's consider two subcases based on the expression inside the absolute value.Subcase 2.1: a - 1 ≥ 0, which implies a ≥ 1.In this subcase, |a - 1| = a - 1. So, the inequality becomes a - 1 ≥ 3 - a.Solving for a: a - 1 ≥ 3 - a → 2a ≥ 4 → a ≥ 2.But remember, in this subcase, a ≥ 1. So, combining both, a must be ≥ 2.Subcase 2.2: a - 1 < 0, which implies a < 1.In this subcase, |a - 1| = -(a - 1) = 1 - a. So, the inequality becomes 1 - a ≥ 3 - a.Simplifying: 1 - a ≥ 3 - a → 1 ≥ 3, which is not true. So, no solution in this subcase.Therefore, in Case 2, the only solutions are a ≥ 2.Putting together both cases:- If a ≥ 3, the inequality holds.- If 2 ≤ a < 3, the inequality also holds.So, combining these, the range of a is a ≥ 2.Wait, let me double-check. If a is between 2 and 3, does the inequality hold?Let me pick a = 2.5. Then, |(2.5 - 1)/2| = |1.5/2| = 0.75. And (3 - 2.5)/2 = 0.25. So, 0.75 ≥ 0.25, which is true.If a = 2, |(2 - 1)/2| = 0.5, and (3 - 2)/2 = 0.5. So, 0.5 ≥ 0.5, which is true.If a = 1.5, which is less than 2, |(1.5 - 1)/2| = 0.25, and (3 - 1.5)/2 = 0.75. So, 0.25 ≥ 0.75 is false. So, a must be at least 2.Therefore, the range of a is [2, ∞).I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**(1) The solution set is boxed{{x mid -1 leqslant x leqslant 3}}.(2) The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{[2, +infty)}."},{"question":"Expand the function ( y = x + 1 ) into a Fourier series on the interval ( (0, pi) ) using the system ( 1, cos frac{1}{2} x, cos frac{3}{2} x, ldots, cos frac{2n+1}{2} x, ldots ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to expand the function ( y = x + 1 ) into a Fourier series on the interval ( (0, pi) ) using a specific system of functions: ( 1, cos frac{1}{2}x, cos frac{3}{2}x, ldots, cos frac{2n+1}{2}x, ldots ). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that a Fourier series is a way to represent a function as a sum of sine and cosine functions. In this case, the system given doesn't include sine functions, only cosine functions with specific arguments. So, it seems like we're dealing with a Fourier cosine series, but not the standard one where the arguments are integer multiples of ( x ). Instead, the arguments here are ( frac{2n+1}{2}x ), which are half-integers.I think the first thing I need to do is recall the general formula for a Fourier series. For a function ( f(x) ) defined on an interval, the Fourier series can be expressed as:[f(x) = frac{a_0}{2} + sum_{n=1}^{infty} left( a_n cos(nx) + b_n sin(nx) right)]But in this case, since we're only using cosine functions with specific arguments, it seems like we're dealing with a Fourier cosine series. However, the arguments are not the usual ( nx ), but rather ( frac{2n+1}{2}x ). So, maybe I need to adjust the standard Fourier series formula to accommodate these different cosine terms.I also remember that for a function defined on ( (0, L) ), the Fourier series can be expressed using either sine or cosine terms, depending on whether we extend the function as odd or even. Since we're using cosine terms, it suggests an even extension. But in this problem, the interval is ( (0, pi) ), so ( L = pi ).Wait, but the cosine terms here have arguments ( frac{2n+1}{2}x ), which are like ( frac{x}{2}, frac{3x}{2}, frac{5x}{2}, ) and so on. That seems different from the standard ( nx ) terms. I wonder if this is related to expanding the function on a different interval or with a different scaling.Maybe I should think about the orthogonality of these cosine functions. For a Fourier series, the functions ( cos frac{2n+1}{2}x ) should be orthogonal on the interval ( (0, pi) ). Let me check that.The inner product of two functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) on ( (0, pi) ) is given by:[langle f, g rangle = int_{0}^{pi} f(x)g(x) dx]So, for orthogonality, we need:[int_{0}^{pi} cos frac{2m+1}{2}x cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = 0 quad text{for } m neq n]Let me compute this integral for ( m neq n ). Using the identity:[cos A cos B = frac{1}{2} [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]]So,[int_{0}^{pi} cos frac{2m+1}{2}x cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{pi} cosleft( frac{2(m+n)+2}{2}x right) + cosleft( frac{2(m-n)}{2}x right) dx]Simplifying,[= frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{pi} cosleft( (m+n+1)x right) + cosleft( (m-n)x right) dx]Now, integrating term by term:[frac{1}{2} left[ frac{sin((m+n+1)x)}{m+n+1} + frac{sin((m-n)x)}{m-n} right]_{0}^{pi}]Since ( m ) and ( n ) are integers, ( m+n+1 ) and ( m-n ) are also integers. The sine of an integer multiple of ( pi ) is zero, so the integral evaluates to zero. Therefore, the functions ( cos frac{2n+1}{2}x ) are indeed orthogonal on ( (0, pi) ).Great, so now I know that these cosine functions form an orthogonal system on the given interval. Next, I need to find the Fourier coefficients ( a_n ) such that:[x + 1 = a_0 + sum_{n=1}^{infty} a_n cos frac{2n+1}{2}x]Wait, actually, the system starts with 1, which is ( cos(0x) ), but in our case, the first term is 1, then ( cos frac{1}{2}x ), etc. So, the general form is:[x + 1 = a_0 + a_1 cos frac{1}{2}x + a_2 cos frac{3}{2}x + a_3 cos frac{5}{2}x + ldots]To find the coefficients ( a_n ), I can use the orthogonality property. Specifically, the formula for the coefficients in a Fourier series is:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx]Wait, why is there a ( frac{2}{pi} ) factor? Let me recall. For a function defined on ( (0, L) ), the Fourier coefficients are scaled by ( frac{2}{L} ). Here, ( L = pi ), so the scaling factor is ( frac{2}{pi} ). That makes sense.So, for each ( n geq 0 ), the coefficient ( a_n ) is given by:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx]Now, I need to compute this integral for each ( n ). Let's start with ( n = 0 ), which corresponds to the constant term.For ( n = 0 ):[a_0 = frac{2}{pi} int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos(0x) dx = frac{2}{pi} int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) dx]Since ( cos(0x) = 1 ).Calculating the integral:[int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) dx = left[ frac{x^2}{2} + x right]_{0}^{pi} = left( frac{pi^2}{2} + pi right) - (0 + 0) = frac{pi^2}{2} + pi]So,[a_0 = frac{2}{pi} left( frac{pi^2}{2} + pi right) = frac{2}{pi} cdot frac{pi^2 + 2pi}{2} = frac{pi + 2}{1} = pi + 2]Okay, that was straightforward. Now, let's consider ( n geq 1 ). So, for ( n geq 1 ), we have:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx]This integral seems a bit more complicated. I think I'll need to use integration by parts. Let me recall the integration by parts formula:[int u dv = uv - int v du]Let me set:[u = x + 1 quad Rightarrow quad du = dx][dv = cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx quad Rightarrow quad v = frac{2}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x]So, applying integration by parts:[int (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = (x + 1) cdot frac{2}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x - int frac{2}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x dx]Simplifying the integral:[= frac{2(x + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x + C]Wait, let me double-check the signs. The integral of ( sin(ax) ) is ( -frac{1}{a} cos(ax) ), so:[- int frac{2}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = - frac{2}{2n+1} cdot left( -frac{2}{2n+1} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x right) + C = frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x + C]Yes, that's correct.Now, evaluating the definite integral from 0 to ( pi ):[int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = left[ frac{2(x + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x right]_{0}^{pi}]Let's compute this at ( x = pi ) and ( x = 0 ).First, at ( x = pi ):[frac{2(pi + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi]Similarly, at ( x = 0 ):[frac{2(0 + 1)}{2n+1} sin 0 + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos 0 = 0 + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cdot 1 = frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]So, subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:[left( frac{2(pi + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi right) - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]Simplify this expression:[frac{2(pi + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} left( cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi - 1 right)]Now, let's analyze the sine and cosine terms.First, ( sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi ). Let's note that ( frac{2n+1}{2} pi = npi + frac{pi}{2} ). So,[sin left( npi + frac{pi}{2} right) = sin npi cos frac{pi}{2} + cos npi sin frac{pi}{2} = 0 + cos npi cdot 1 = (-1)^n]Because ( cos npi = (-1)^n ).Next, ( cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi = cos left( npi + frac{pi}{2} right) ). Using the cosine addition formula:[cos(npi + frac{pi}{2}) = cos npi cos frac{pi}{2} - sin npi sin frac{pi}{2} = (-1)^n cdot 0 - 0 cdot 1 = 0]So, ( cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi = 0 ).Therefore, substituting back into the expression:[frac{2(pi + 1)}{2n+1} (-1)^n + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} (0 - 1) = frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]So, the integral becomes:[int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]Now, recall that:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = frac{2}{pi} left( frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} right )]Simplify this expression:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} cdot frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} - frac{2}{pi} cdot frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}][= frac{4(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{pi(2n+1)} - frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2}]Hmm, this seems a bit messy. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this further or if I made a mistake in the integration by parts.Wait, let me double-check the integration by parts steps.We had:[int (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = frac{2(x + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2}x + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x + C]Then, evaluating from 0 to ( pi ):At ( x = pi ):[frac{2(pi + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi]At ( x = 0 ):[frac{2(1)}{2n+1} sin 0 + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos 0 = 0 + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]So, subtracting:[frac{2(pi + 1)}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]Which simplifies to:[frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} + frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} (0 - 1) = frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]Yes, that seems correct.So, the coefficient ( a_n ) is:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} left( frac{2(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} right ) = frac{4(pi + 1)(-1)^n}{pi(2n+1)} - frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2}]Hmm, this expression has two terms. I wonder if there's a way to combine them or if I can express this differently.Alternatively, maybe I can factor out ( frac{4}{pi(2n+1)} ):[a_n = frac{4}{pi(2n+1)} left( (pi + 1)(-1)^n - frac{2}{2n+1} right )]But I'm not sure if this helps much.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me try a different approach. Maybe instead of integrating by parts, I can use the standard integral formula for ( int x cos(ax) dx ).Recall that:[int x cos(ax) dx = frac{cos(ax)}{a^2} + frac{x sin(ax)}{a} + C]And,[int cos(ax) dx = frac{sin(ax)}{a} + C]So, perhaps I can split the integral into two parts:[int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = int_{0}^{pi} x cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx + int_{0}^{pi} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx]Let me compute each integral separately.First, ( I_1 = int_{0}^{pi} x cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx )Using the formula:[I_1 = left[ frac{cos frac{2n+1}{2}x}{left( frac{2n+1}{2} right)^2} + frac{x sin frac{2n+1}{2}x}{frac{2n+1}{2}} right]_{0}^{pi}]Simplify:[I_1 = left[ frac{4 cos frac{2n+1}{2}x}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2x sin frac{2n+1}{2}x}{2n+1} right]_{0}^{pi}]Evaluate at ( x = pi ):[frac{4 cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2pi sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi}{2n+1}]And at ( x = 0 ):[frac{4 cos 0}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{0}{2n+1} = frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]So, subtracting:[I_1 = left( frac{4 cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2pi sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi}{2n+1} right ) - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]Simplify:[I_1 = frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} left( cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi - 1 right ) + frac{2pi}{2n+1} sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi]As before, ( cos frac{2n+1}{2} pi = 0 ) and ( sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi = (-1)^n ). So,[I_1 = frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} (0 - 1) + frac{2pi}{2n+1} (-1)^n = -frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2pi (-1)^n}{2n+1}]Now, compute the second integral ( I_2 = int_{0}^{pi} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx )Using the standard integral:[I_2 = left[ frac{sin frac{2n+1}{2}x}{frac{2n+1}{2}} right]_{0}^{pi} = frac{2}{2n+1} left( sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi - sin 0 right ) = frac{2}{2n+1} cdot (-1)^n]Because ( sin frac{2n+1}{2} pi = (-1)^n ) and ( sin 0 = 0 ).So, combining ( I_1 ) and ( I_2 ):[int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = I_1 + I_2 = left( -frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2pi (-1)^n}{2n+1} right ) + frac{2(-1)^n}{2n+1}]Simplify:[= -frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2pi (-1)^n}{2n+1} + frac{2(-1)^n}{2n+1}]Factor out ( frac{2(-1)^n}{2n+1} ):[= -frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} + frac{2(-1)^n}{2n+1} (pi + 1)]So, the integral is:[int_{0}^{pi} (x + 1) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x dx = frac{2(-1)^n (pi + 1)}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2}]Therefore, the coefficient ( a_n ) is:[a_n = frac{2}{pi} left( frac{2(-1)^n (pi + 1)}{2n+1} - frac{4}{(2n+1)^2} right ) = frac{4(-1)^n (pi + 1)}{pi(2n+1)} - frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2}]Hmm, this seems consistent with what I got earlier. So, it looks like the coefficients ( a_n ) have two terms: one involving ( (-1)^n ) and another that's negative and involves ( frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} ).But I'm wondering if there's a way to express this more neatly or if I can combine these terms somehow. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out ( frac{4}{pi(2n+1)} ):[a_n = frac{4}{pi(2n+1)} left( (-1)^n (pi + 1) - frac{2}{2n+1} right )]But I'm not sure if this helps much in terms of simplifying the expression.Wait, perhaps I can write the entire Fourier series expression now, including the constant term ( a_0 ):[x + 1 = a_0 + sum_{n=1}^{infty} a_n cos frac{2n+1}{2}x]Substituting the values we found:[x + 1 = (pi + 2) + sum_{n=1}^{infty} left( frac{4(-1)^n (pi + 1)}{pi(2n+1)} - frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2} right ) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. I wonder if there's a way to combine the two sums or if I can express this in a more compact form.Alternatively, maybe I can separate the sums:[x + 1 = (pi + 2) + frac{4(pi + 1)}{pi} sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x - frac{8}{pi} sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x]But I'm not sure if this is helpful. It might be better to leave it as is, with the coefficients expressed as they are.Wait, let me check if the series converges properly. Since the function ( x + 1 ) is continuous and piecewise smooth on ( (0, pi) ), the Fourier series should converge to the function at points of continuity and to the average of the left and right limits at points of discontinuity. However, since we're expanding on ( (0, pi) ) and using an even extension, the convergence should be good within the interval.Another thing I'm thinking about is whether the series can be simplified further or if there's a known Fourier series that resembles this form. I recall that the Fourier series for functions like ( x ) or ( 1 ) on specific intervals have known forms, but this seems a bit different because of the half-integer multiples in the cosine arguments.Alternatively, maybe I can consider a substitution to make the argument of the cosine function an integer multiple. Let me set ( t = frac{x}{2} ). Then, ( x = 2t ), and the interval ( (0, pi) ) becomes ( (0, frac{pi}{2}) ). But I'm not sure if this substitution helps because the problem is already defined on ( (0, pi) ).Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a Fourier series on a different interval. If I let ( t = frac{x}{2} ), then ( x = 2t ), and the interval ( (0, pi) ) becomes ( (0, frac{pi}{2}) ). Then, the function becomes ( 2t + 1 ), and the cosine terms become ( cos((2n+1)t) ). So, it's like expanding ( 2t + 1 ) on ( (0, frac{pi}{2}) ) using the system ( cos((2n+1)t) ).But I'm not sure if this substitution helps in terms of simplifying the problem or if it's just complicating things further.Another approach could be to consider the function ( x + 1 ) on ( (0, pi) ) and extend it appropriately to form a function on ( (-pi, pi) ) or another interval where the standard Fourier series applies. However, since the problem specifically asks for the expansion using the given system on ( (0, pi) ), I think it's best to stick with the approach I've taken so far.So, to summarize, the Fourier series expansion of ( x + 1 ) on ( (0, pi) ) using the system ( 1, cos frac{1}{2}x, cos frac{3}{2}x, ldots ) is given by:[x + 1 = (pi + 2) + sum_{n=1}^{infty} left( frac{4(-1)^n (pi + 1)}{pi(2n+1)} - frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2} right ) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x]This seems to be the final expression. However, I'm a bit concerned about the negative term involving ( frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2} ). It might be worth checking if this term can be combined with the constant term or if it's an artifact of the integration process.Wait, let me think about the constant term ( a_0 ). We found that ( a_0 = pi + 2 ). If I look at the general term for ( a_n ), it has a term involving ( (-1)^n ) and another negative term. Maybe if I include the ( n = 0 ) term in the sum, I can write the entire series more compactly.But in our case, the constant term is separate, and the sum starts from ( n = 1 ). So, perhaps it's better to keep it as is.Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire series as:[x + 1 = frac{4(pi + 1)}{pi} sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x - frac{8}{pi} sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} cos frac{2n+1}{2}x + (pi + 2)]But this seems to complicate things further. I think it's best to present the series with the constant term and the sum as we derived.In conclusion, after computing the Fourier coefficients using integration by parts and verifying the orthogonality of the cosine system, the Fourier series expansion of ( x + 1 ) on ( (0, pi) ) using the given system is:[x + 1 = (pi + 2) + sum_{n=1}^{infty} left( frac{4(-1)^n (pi + 1)}{pi(2n+1)} - frac{8}{pi(2n+1)^2} right ) cos frac{2n+1}{2}x]I think this is the final answer, although it's a bit involved. I hope I didn't make any calculation errors along the way, but I double-checked the integration steps, and they seem correct."},{"question":"Both roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 58x + k = 0 are prime numbers. How many possible values of k are there?","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: (x^2 - 58x + k = 0). The problem says both roots are prime numbers, and I need to find how many possible values of (k) there are. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form (x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = 0), the sum of the roots (p + q) is equal to the coefficient of (x) with a negative sign, and the product (pq) is the constant term. So in this case, the sum of the roots is 58, and the product is (k). That means if I can find two prime numbers that add up to 58, their product will give me a possible value of (k).Now, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, etc. Since 58 is an even number, I recall that the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the sum of an even and an odd number is odd. Since all primes except 2 are odd, the only way to get an even sum like 58 is if one of the primes is 2 and the other is 56. But wait, 56 isn't a prime number because it's divisible by 2, 4, 7, etc. So that doesn't work.Hmm, so maybe both primes are odd. Let me check if that's possible. If both primes are odd, their sum would be even, which is consistent with 58 being even. So, I need two odd primes that add up to 58. Let me try to find such pairs.Starting with the smallest odd prime, which is 3. If one prime is 3, the other would be 58 - 3 = 55. But 55 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 5 and 11. So that doesn't work.Next, let's try 5. If one prime is 5, the other would be 58 - 5 = 53. Is 53 a prime? Yes, 53 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself. So, 5 and 53 are both primes and their sum is 58. That's one valid pair.Let me continue checking other primes to see if there are more pairs. The next prime is 7. If one prime is 7, the other would be 58 - 7 = 51. But 51 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 3 and 17. So that doesn't work.Next, 11. 58 - 11 = 47. Is 47 a prime? Yes, it is. So, 11 and 47 are both primes and their sum is 58. That's another valid pair.Wait, did I miss this earlier? Let me check again. 11 and 47 add up to 58, and both are primes. So that's another possible value for (k). Hmm, so I have two pairs now: (5, 53) and (11, 47).Let me keep going. The next prime is 13. 58 - 13 = 45. 45 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 5 and 9. So that doesn't work.Next, 17. 58 - 17 = 41. Is 41 a prime? Yes, it is. So, 17 and 41 are both primes and their sum is 58. That's another pair. So now I have three pairs: (5, 53), (11, 47), and (17, 41).Continuing, the next prime is 19. 58 - 19 = 39. 39 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 3 and 13. So that doesn't work.Next, 23. 58 - 23 = 35. 35 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 5 and 7. So that doesn't work.Next, 29. 58 - 29 = 29. Wait, 29 is a prime. So, 29 and 29 add up to 58. But are both roots allowed to be the same? The problem says \\"both roots,\\" but it doesn't specify if they have to be distinct. So, if we consider 29 and 29 as valid, then that's another pair. But I'm not sure if the problem allows for repeated roots. Let me check the problem statement again.It says, \\"both roots of the quadratic equation are prime numbers.\\" It doesn't specify they have to be distinct, so I think 29 and 29 are acceptable. So that's another pair: (29, 29). Therefore, (k) would be 29 * 29 = 841. So that's another possible value.Wait, but earlier I thought of only one pair, but now I'm finding multiple pairs. Let me make sure I didn't miss any.Continuing from where I left off, after 29, the next prime is 31. 58 - 31 = 27. 27 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 3 and 9. So that doesn't work.Next, 37. 58 - 37 = 21. 21 isn't a prime because it's divisible by 3 and 7. So that doesn't work.Next, 41. 58 - 41 = 17. We've already considered 17 and 41 earlier, so that's the same pair.Similarly, 43. 58 - 43 = 15. 15 isn't a prime. So that doesn't work.47. 58 - 47 = 11. We've already considered 11 and 47.53. 58 - 53 = 5. We've already considered 5 and 53.59. 58 - 59 is negative, so that's not applicable.So, in total, the valid pairs of primes that add up to 58 are:1. (5, 53)2. (11, 47)3. (17, 41)4. (29, 29)Each of these pairs will give a different value of (k), which is the product of the two primes.Calculating (k) for each pair:1. For (5, 53): (k = 5 * 53 = 265)2. For (11, 47): (k = 11 * 47 = 517)3. For (17, 41): (k = 17 * 41 = 697)4. For (29, 29): (k = 29 * 29 = 841)So, there are four possible values of (k): 265, 517, 697, and 841.Wait a minute, but earlier I thought only one pair was valid. Did I make a mistake in my initial reasoning? Let me go back.In the initial thought process, I considered that one of the primes must be 2, but that didn't work because 56 isn't prime. Then I thought of (5, 53) as the only pair, but now I see there are more pairs. So, I must have overlooked them initially.I think the key is to systematically check all possible prime pairs that add up to 58, not just stopping at the first one I find. So, by methodically checking each prime less than 58 and seeing if the complement (58 - prime) is also a prime, I can find all valid pairs.Therefore, the correct number of possible values for (k) is four."},{"question":"Calculate the value of the product (left(1-frac{1}{4}right) cdotleft(1-frac{1}{9}right) cdotleft(1-frac{1}{16}right) cdots left(1-frac{1}{2023^{2}}right).","answer":"Okay, so I have this product to calculate: (left(1 - frac{1}{4}right) cdot left(1 - frac{1}{9}right) cdot left(1 - frac{1}{16}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{2023^2}right)). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense.First, let me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. The first term is (1 - frac{1}{4}), which is (frac{3}{4}). The next term is (1 - frac{1}{9}), which is (frac{8}{9}). Then, (1 - frac{1}{16}) is (frac{15}{16}). Wait a second, these numerators and denominators seem familiar. Let me see:Each term is of the form (1 - frac{1}{n^2}). So, for the first term, (n = 2) because (2^2 = 4). The second term, (n = 3) because (3^2 = 9), and so on. So, in general, each term is (1 - frac{1}{n^2}) where (n) starts at 2 and goes up to 2023.Now, I remember that (1 - frac{1}{n^2}) can be factored as (frac{(n - 1)(n + 1)}{n^2}). Let me verify that:[1 - frac{1}{n^2} = frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2} = frac{(n - 1)(n + 1)}{n^2}]Yes, that's correct. So, each term can be rewritten as (frac{(n - 1)(n + 1)}{n^2}). That might help in simplifying the product.So, substituting back into the product, we have:[prod_{n=2}^{2023} frac{(n - 1)(n + 1)}{n^2}]Let me write this out for a few terms to see what happens:For (n = 2): (frac{(1)(3)}{2^2} = frac{3}{4})For (n = 3): (frac{(2)(4)}{3^2} = frac{8}{9})For (n = 4): (frac{(3)(5)}{4^2} = frac{15}{16})And so on, up to (n = 2023): (frac{(2022)(2024)}{2023^2})So, the entire product becomes:[left(frac{3}{4}right) cdot left(frac{8}{9}right) cdot left(frac{15}{16}right) cdots left(frac{2022 cdot 2024}{2023^2}right)]Hmm, maybe I can separate the numerators and denominators to see if there's a telescoping effect or some cancellation happening.Let me write the numerators and denominators separately:Numerators: (3 cdot 8 cdot 15 cdot ldots cdot (2022 cdot 2024))Denominators: (4 cdot 9 cdot 16 cdot ldots cdot 2023^2)Wait, let me see if I can factor these numerators and denominators further.Looking at the numerators:Each term is ((n - 1)(n + 1)), so for (n = 2), it's (1 cdot 3); for (n = 3), it's (2 cdot 4); for (n = 4), it's (3 cdot 5); and so on, up to (2022 cdot 2024).Similarly, the denominators are (n^2), so for (n = 2), it's (2^2 = 4); for (n = 3), it's (3^2 = 9); and so on, up to (2023^2).So, if I write the entire product as:[frac{1 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 2022 cdot 2024}{2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 4^2 cdot ldots cdot 2023^2}]Wait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange the terms.Let me group the numerators and denominators differently. The numerators can be written as:[(1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot 2022) cdot (3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 2024)]Similarly, the denominators can be written as:[(2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot ldots cdot 2023)^2]Wait, let me check that. The denominators are (2^2, 3^2, 4^2, ldots, 2023^2), so when multiplied together, it's ((2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot ldots cdot 2023)^2).Similarly, the numerators are ((1 cdot 3) cdot (2 cdot 4) cdot (3 cdot 5) cdot ldots cdot (2022 cdot 2024)). So, that's ((1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot 2022) cdot (3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 2024)).So, putting it all together, the product becomes:[frac{(1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot 2022) cdot (3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 2024)}{(2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot ldots cdot 2023)^2}]Hmm, let me denote (k! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot ldots cdot k). So, the numerator can be expressed as:[(2022!) cdot left(frac{2024!}{2!}right)]Wait, because (3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 2024 = frac{2024!}{2!}).Similarly, the denominator is ((2023!)^2).So, substituting back, the product becomes:[frac{2022! cdot frac{2024!}{2}}{(2023!)^2}]Simplifying this expression:First, let's write (2024! = 2024 cdot 2023!). So, substituting that in:[frac{2022! cdot frac{2024 cdot 2023!}{2}}{(2023!)^2}]Simplify the numerator:[frac{2022! cdot 2024 cdot 2023!}{2}]Now, the denominator is ((2023!)^2), so we can write:[frac{2022! cdot 2024 cdot 2023!}{2 cdot (2023!)^2} = frac{2022! cdot 2024}{2 cdot 2023!}]Because one (2023!) cancels out from the numerator and denominator.Now, (2023! = 2023 cdot 2022!), so substituting that in:[frac{2022! cdot 2024}{2 cdot 2023 cdot 2022!} = frac{2024}{2 cdot 2023}]The (2022!) terms cancel out.Simplify the fraction:[frac{2024}{2 cdot 2023} = frac{2024}{4046}]Wait, let me check that division. 2024 divided by 2 is 1012, so:[frac{2024}{2 cdot 2023} = frac{1012}{2023}]Yes, that's correct.So, after all that simplification, the entire product simplifies down to (frac{1012}{2023}).Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by expressing each term as a fraction, recognized the telescoping nature of the product, broke it down into factorials, and then simplified step by step. Each step seems logical, and the cancellations make sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the final answer is correct."},{"question":"The school decided to have a fundraiser to collect 750 for new basketball equipment. Families could donate different amounts to get different statuses. With one day left in the fundraiser, the school has 10 Bronze Status families, 7 Silver Status Families and 1 Gold Status family. They need to raise 50 on the final day to reach their goal. How much do families need to donate to get Bronze Status?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much families need to donate to get Bronze Status for the school's fundraiser. The goal is to collect 750 for new basketball equipment. Right now, with one day left, they've already got some donations from 10 Bronze Status families, 7 Silver Status families, and 1 Gold Status family. They still need to raise 50 more to reach their goal.First, I need to understand what's been donated so far. The total goal is 750, and they need 50 more, which means they've already raised 700. So, the sum of all donations from Bronze, Silver, and Gold Status families is 700.Let's denote:- B as the amount donated by each Bronze Status family,- S as the amount donated by each Silver Status family,- G as the amount donated by each Gold Status family.Given that there are 10 Bronze Status families, 7 Silver Status families, and 1 Gold Status family, the total amount raised can be represented by the equation:10B + 7S + G = 700But here's the problem: I don't know the values of S and G. Without knowing how much Silver and Gold Status families donated, I can't directly solve for B. Maybe I can make some assumptions or find relationships between B, S, and G.I know that typically, different statuses imply different donation tiers. So, Bronze Status is probably the lowest tier, followed by Silver, and then Gold as the highest. That means:B < S < GSince they need 50 more to reach their goal, and they've already got 700, I wonder if the 50 needed on the final day is related to the Bronze Status donation. Maybe the Bronze Status is set at 50? But that seems too low for a donation tier, especially if they've already got 10 Bronze Status families contributing 50 each, which would be 500. Then, the remaining 200 would come from Silver and Gold Status families.Wait, but if Bronze Status is 50, then 10 families would contribute 500, leaving 200 from 7 Silver and 1 Gold families. That seems possible, but I'm not sure if 50 is the right amount for Bronze Status. Maybe it's higher.Alternatively, maybe the 50 needed on the final day is the amount required to reach the next tier, not the Bronze Status. So, if they need 50 more, perhaps Bronze Status is just below that amount. But I'm not sure.I think I need more information to solve this accurately. Without knowing the donation amounts for Silver and Gold Status, I can't determine the exact amount for Bronze Status. Maybe I can set up some inequalities based on the tiers.Since B < S < G, and the total donations are 700, I can try to find a range for B. Let's assume that Silver Status is at least 10 more than Bronze, and Gold Status is at least 10 more than Silver. So, S = B + 10 and G = S + 10 = B + 20.Plugging these into the equation:10B + 7(B + 10) + (B + 20) = 70010B + 7B + 70 + B + 20 = 70018B + 90 = 70018B = 610B = 610 / 18B ≈ 33.89So, Bronze Status would be approximately 33.89, Silver Status would be around 43.89, and Gold Status would be about 53.89. But this is just an assumption based on the tiers being 10 apart. If the tiers are different, the amounts would change.Alternatively, if I assume that Bronze Status is 50, then:10 * 50 = 500So, the remaining 200 comes from 7 Silver and 1 Gold families:7S + G = 200If I assume that Gold Status is significantly higher, say 100, then:7S + 100 = 2007S = 100S ≈ 14.29But that doesn't make sense because Silver Status should be higher than Bronze Status (50). So, my assumption that Gold Status is 100 might be too high.Maybe Gold Status is 50 more than Bronze Status, so G = B + 50. Then:10B + 7S + (B + 50) = 70011B + 7S = 650If I assume Silver Status is 10 more than Bronze, S = B + 10:11B + 7(B + 10) = 65011B + 7B + 70 = 65018B = 580B ≈ 32.22So, Bronze Status would be approximately 32.22, Silver Status around 42.22, and Gold Status around 82.22. Again, this is based on arbitrary assumptions about the differences between tiers.I think without specific information about the donation amounts for Silver and Gold Status, it's impossible to determine the exact amount for Bronze Status. The problem might be missing some details or expecting an assumption to be made.Maybe the key is that they need 50 more, and since Bronze Status is the lowest, the 50 needed could be the Bronze Status amount. So, families need to donate 50 to get Bronze Status. That would mean that on the final day, they need one more Bronze Status donation to reach the goal.But earlier, I thought that might be too low, but if they've already got 10 Bronze Status families donating 50 each, that's 500, and the remaining 200 from Silver and Gold, which seems plausible.Alternatively, if Bronze Status is higher, say 60, then 10 families would contribute 600, leaving 100 from Silver and Gold, which might be more reasonable.I'm going in circles here. I think the safest assumption is that Bronze Status is 50, as they need 50 more, and that could be the amount required for Bronze Status."},{"question":"Car A travels one-third of a distance at u miles per hour and two-thirds at v miles per hour. Car B travels one-third of the time at u miles per hour and two-thirds at v miles per hour. The average speed of Car A is x miles per hour and that of Car B is y miles per hour. Compare x and y.A) x leq yB) x geq yC) x = yD) x < yE) x > y","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two cars, Car A and Car B, traveling with different speed patterns, and I need to compare their average speeds, x and y. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what each car is doing. Car A is traveling one-third of the distance at speed u and two-thirds of the distance at speed v. On the other hand, Car B is traveling one-third of the time at speed u and two-thirds of the time at speed v. I need to find their average speeds and compare them.Starting with Car A. Since it's covering different fractions of the distance at different speeds, I think I should calculate the total time taken for the trip and then find the average speed. Let me denote the total distance as D. So, one-third of the distance is D/3, and two-thirds is 2D/3.For the first part, Car A travels D/3 at speed u. The time taken for this part would be distance divided by speed, so (D/3)/u = D/(3u). Similarly, for the second part, it travels 2D/3 at speed v, so the time taken is (2D/3)/v = 2D/(3v).Therefore, the total time taken by Car A is D/(3u) + 2D/(3v). To find the average speed x, I need to divide the total distance D by the total time. So,x = D / [D/(3u) + 2D/(3v)].I can factor out D from the denominator:x = D / [D(1/(3u) + 2/(3v))] = 1 / [1/(3u) + 2/(3v)].Simplifying the denominator:1/(3u) + 2/(3v) = (1/u + 2/v)/3.So,x = 1 / [(1/u + 2/v)/3] = 3 / (1/u + 2/v).Alright, so that's the average speed for Car A. Now, moving on to Car B.Car B is traveling one-third of the time at speed u and two-thirds of the time at speed v. Let me denote the total time as T. So, one-third of the time is T/3, and two-thirds is 2T/3.The distance covered in the first part is speed multiplied by time, so u*(T/3) = uT/3. Similarly, the distance covered in the second part is v*(2T/3) = 2vT/3.Therefore, the total distance covered by Car B is uT/3 + 2vT/3. To find the average speed y, I divide the total distance by the total time T:y = (uT/3 + 2vT/3) / T.Simplifying this:y = (u/3 + 2v/3) = (u + 2v)/3.So, the average speed for Car B is (u + 2v)/3.Now, I need to compare x and y. Let me write down the expressions again:x = 3 / (1/u + 2/v)y = (u + 2v)/3Hmm, so I need to compare these two expressions. Maybe I can manipulate them to see which one is larger.Let me consider the reciprocal of x:1/x = (1/u + 2/v)/3So, 1/x = (v + 2u)/(3uv)Wait, let me check that:1/x = (1/u + 2/v)/3 = (v + 2u)/(3uv)Yes, that's correct.So, 1/x = (v + 2u)/(3uv)And y = (u + 2v)/3Hmm, so if I take the reciprocal of x, it's (v + 2u)/(3uv), and y is (u + 2v)/3.I need to see if x is less than, greater than, or equal to y.Alternatively, maybe I can cross-multiply to compare x and y.Let me set up the inequality:Is x ≤ y?Which is:3 / (1/u + 2/v) ≤ (u + 2v)/3Multiply both sides by (1/u + 2/v):3 ≤ (u + 2v)/3 * (1/u + 2/v)Simplify the right side:(u + 2v)/3 * (1/u + 2/v) = (u + 2v)(1/u + 2/v)/3Let me compute (u + 2v)(1/u + 2/v):= u*(1/u) + u*(2/v) + 2v*(1/u) + 2v*(2/v)= 1 + 2u/v + 2v/u + 4Wait, let me compute term by term:First term: u*(1/u) = 1Second term: u*(2/v) = 2u/vThird term: 2v*(1/u) = 2v/uFourth term: 2v*(2/v) = 4So, adding them up: 1 + 2u/v + 2v/u + 4 = 5 + 2u/v + 2v/uTherefore, the right side is (5 + 2u/v + 2v/u)/3So, the inequality becomes:3 ≤ (5 + 2u/v + 2v/u)/3Multiply both sides by 3:9 ≤ 5 + 2u/v + 2v/uSubtract 5:4 ≤ 2u/v + 2v/uDivide both sides by 2:2 ≤ u/v + v/uNow, I need to check if u/v + v/u is always greater than or equal to 2.I recall that for any positive real numbers a and b, a/b + b/a ≥ 2, with equality if and only if a = b.This is because a/b + b/a = (a^2 + b^2)/(ab) ≥ 2ab/(ab) = 2, by AM ≥ GM.So, yes, u/v + v/u ≥ 2, which means 2 ≤ u/v + v/u is always true.Therefore, the inequality 3 ≤ (5 + 2u/v + 2v/u)/3 holds, which implies that x ≤ y.So, the average speed of Car A is less than or equal to that of Car B.Wait, but let me think again. If u = v, then both cars would have the same average speed, right? Because if both cars are moving at the same speed throughout, their average speeds would be equal.But in the case where u ≠ v, which one is faster? Let me take an example.Suppose u = 30 mph and v = 60 mph.For Car A:x = 3 / (1/30 + 2/60) = 3 / (1/30 + 1/30) = 3 / (2/30) = 3 * (30/2) = 45 mph.For Car B:y = (30 + 2*60)/3 = (30 + 120)/3 = 150/3 = 50 mph.So, in this case, x = 45 and y = 50, so x < y.Another example: u = 10 mph and v = 20 mph.Car A:x = 3 / (1/10 + 2/20) = 3 / (1/10 + 1/10) = 3 / (2/10) = 3 * (10/2) = 15 mph.Car B:y = (10 + 2*20)/3 = (10 + 40)/3 = 50/3 ≈ 16.67 mph.Again, x < y.What if u > v? Let's say u = 60 mph and v = 30 mph.Car A:x = 3 / (1/60 + 2/30) = 3 / (1/60 + 1/15) = 3 / (1/60 + 4/60) = 3 / (5/60) = 3 * (60/5) = 36 mph.Car B:y = (60 + 2*30)/3 = (60 + 60)/3 = 120/3 = 40 mph.Again, x < y.Wait, so in all these examples, x is less than y. So, does that mean x is always less than or equal to y?Yes, because as we saw earlier, the inequality reduces to u/v + v/u ≥ 2, which is always true, with equality only when u = v.Therefore, x ≤ y, with equality if and only if u = v.So, the answer should be A) x ≤ y."},{"question":"Given P = (sqrt{2012}+sqrt{2013}), Q = (-sqrt{2012}-sqrt{2013}), R = (sqrt{2012}-sqrt{2013}), and S = (sqrt{2013}-sqrt{2012}), find PQRS.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the product (PQRS) where (P = (sqrt{2012} + sqrt{2013})), (Q = (-sqrt{2012} - sqrt{2013})), (R = (sqrt{2012} - sqrt{2013})), and (S = (sqrt{2013} - sqrt{2012})).I'll start by finding the product (PR):[PR = (sqrt{2012} + sqrt{2013})(sqrt{2012} - sqrt{2013})]Using the difference of squares formula:[PR = (sqrt{2012})^2 - (sqrt{2013})^2 = 2012 - 2013 = -1]Next, I'll calculate the product (QS):[QS = (-sqrt{2012} - sqrt{2013})(sqrt{2013} - sqrt{2012})]Factor out a negative sign from the first term:[QS = -(sqrt{2012} + sqrt{2013})(sqrt{2013} - sqrt{2012})]Again, using the difference of squares formula:[(sqrt{2012} + sqrt{2013})(sqrt{2013} - sqrt{2012}) = (sqrt{2013})^2 - (sqrt{2012})^2 = 2013 - 2012 = 1]So,[QS = -1]Finally, to find (PQRS), I'll multiply (PR) and (QS):[PQRS = PR times QS = (-1) times (-1) = 1]"},{"question":"Inside a convex quadrilateral, find the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices of the quadrilateral is minimized.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Inside a convex quadrilateral, find the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices of the quadrilateral is minimized. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in geometry, there are certain points like the centroid, circumcenter, incenter, and orthocenter, but I'm not sure if any of those directly apply here. Maybe it's something else.First, let me visualize a convex quadrilateral. It's a four-sided figure where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the sides don't cross each other. So, it's a simple, non-intersecting shape. Now, I need to find a point inside this shape such that if I add up the distances from this point to each of the four vertices, that total is as small as possible.I wonder if this point has a specific name. Maybe it's called the geometric median? I think I've heard of that term before. The geometric median minimizes the sum of distances to a set of points. So, in this case, the four vertices of the quadrilateral. That sounds right.But wait, how do I find the geometric median for four points? Is there a formula or a specific method? I know that for three points forming a triangle, the geometric median is the Fermat-Torricelli point, which is the point such that the total distance from the three vertices is minimized. But for four points, especially in a convex quadrilateral, I'm not sure.Maybe I can think about the properties of the convex quadrilateral. It has two diagonals, right? The diagonals intersect at a point. Could that point be the geometric median? Let me consider that.If I take the point where the diagonals intersect, let's call it M. Then, from M, I can draw lines to each of the four vertices. The sum of the distances from M to each vertex would be MA + MB + MC + MD. Is this sum the smallest possible?To check this, maybe I can use some inequalities or properties of convex quadrilaterals. I remember that in a convex quadrilateral, the diagonals intersect each other, and each diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two triangles. Maybe I can apply some triangle inequality here.Let me consider triangle ABC. If I take any point N inside the quadrilateral, then in triangle ABC, the sum of distances from N to A and C should be greater than or equal to the length of AC. Similarly, in triangle ADC, the sum of distances from N to A and C should also be greater than or equal to AC. Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe I'm not approaching this correctly.Alternatively, perhaps I should consider both diagonals. Let's say the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at M. Then, for any other point N inside the quadrilateral, can I show that MA + MB + MC + MD is less than or equal to NA + NB + NC + ND?Hmm, let's try to break it down. For point N, consider triangles ANB, BNC, CND, and DNA. Maybe I can apply the triangle inequality to each of these triangles.In triangle ANB, we have NA + NB ≥ AB. Similarly, in triangle BNC, NB + NC ≥ BC. In triangle CND, NC + ND ≥ CD. And in triangle DNA, ND + NA ≥ DA. If I add all these inequalities together, I get 2(NA + NB + NC + ND) ≥ AB + BC + CD + DA.But that doesn't directly help me compare the sums from M and N. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, what if I consider the diagonals separately? Let's look at diagonal AC. The point M is the intersection of the diagonals, so it's on both AC and BD. For any other point N, if I consider the distances from N to A and C, by the triangle inequality, NA + NC ≥ AC. But since M is on AC, AM + MC = AC. So, NA + NC ≥ AM + MC.Similarly, for diagonal BD, NB + ND ≥ BD, and since BM + MD = BD, we have NB + ND ≥ BM + MD.Adding these two inequalities together, we get NA + NC + NB + ND ≥ AM + MC + BM + MD. So, the sum of distances from N to all four vertices is at least the sum from M to all four vertices.That seems to suggest that M is indeed the point that minimizes the sum of distances. So, the point where the diagonals intersect is the geometric median in this case.But wait, is this always true? What if the quadrilateral is not a parallelogram? Does the intersection of the diagonals still give the minimal sum?Let me think about a specific example. Suppose I have a square. The diagonals intersect at the center, which is also the centroid. Intuitively, the center should be the point that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices because it's equidistant from all four vertices. So, in a square, the center is the geometric median.What about a rectangle? Similarly, the center where the diagonals intersect should be the point that minimizes the sum of distances. It makes sense because it's symmetric.What if the quadrilateral is a kite? A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides equal. The diagonals intersect at right angles, and one diagonal is bisected by the other. In this case, the intersection point is still the geometric median because it's the point that balances the distances to all four vertices.What about a more irregular convex quadrilateral? Let's say a trapezoid that's not a parallelogram. The diagonals still intersect at a point, and I think the same logic applies. The sum of distances from any other point would be greater because of the triangle inequality.So, it seems that regardless of the type of convex quadrilateral, the intersection of the diagonals is the point that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices.But just to be thorough, let me consider a point N that's very close to one of the vertices, say A. Then, the sum of distances from N to A would be very small, but the distances to the other three vertices would be almost the same as the distances from A to those vertices. So, the total sum would be approximately the sum of distances from A to B, C, and D, plus a very small distance from N to A.On the other hand, the sum from M to all four vertices would be the sum of MA, MB, MC, and MD. Since M is the intersection of the diagonals, it's somewhere inside the quadrilateral, so each of these distances is less than the distances from A to the other vertices. Therefore, the sum from M is likely smaller.Wait, is that always true? Let me think. If I take a point very close to A, the distance from N to A is almost zero, but the distances from N to B, C, and D are almost equal to AB, AC, and AD, respectively. Whereas, from M, the distances to each vertex are all less than the lengths of the sides. So, the sum from M is indeed smaller.Therefore, the point where the diagonals intersect is the geometric median, minimizing the sum of distances to the vertices.I think I've convinced myself that the intersection of the diagonals is the point we're looking for. It satisfies the condition based on the triangle inequality and seems to hold for various types of convex quadrilaterals. So, I can conclude that the point inside a convex quadrilateral that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices is the intersection point of the diagonals."},{"question":"Let n > 1.

Alice goes first, and they both want to maximize their total sum. The question is, does either player have a strategy that guarantees they don't lose?Hmm, let me think about smaller cases first to get a feel for the problem. Maybe if I start with n=2, so there are 4 cards. Let's say the cards are arranged in some order, like 1, 3, 2, 4. Alice goes first and can pick either 1 or 4. If she picks 4, then Bob can pick either 1 or 2. If Bob picks 2, then Alice is left with 1 and 3. She picks 3, and Bob gets 1. So Alice's total is 4+3=7, Bob's is 2+1=3.

She picks 4, Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 3+4=7, Bob's is 2+1=3. Alice wins. If Alice picks 2 first, Bob can pick 3, then Alice is left with 1 and 4. She picks 4, Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 2+4=6, Bob's is 3+1=4. Alice still wins. Hmm, interesting.Wait, so in both cases, Alice wins if she picks the higher available card each time. But in the first example, if she didn't pick the higher card, she lost. So maybe the key is for Alice to always pick the higher available card? But how does she know which one is higher? Because the cards are shuffled, she doesn't know the order.Wait, no, the cards are laid out with numbers visible. So Alice can see all the numbers, right? So she can see which end has the higher number and pick that one. Similarly, Bob can do the same on his turn.So if both players are picking the higher available card each time, what happens? Let's see. In the first example: 1, 3, 2, 4. Alice sees 1 and 4. She picks 4. Then Bob sees 1 and 2. He picks 2. Then Alice sees 1 and 3. She picks 3. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 4+3=7, Bob's is 2+1=3. Alice wins.In the second example: 3, 1, 4, 2. Alice sees 3 and 2. She picks 3. Bob sees 1 and 2. He picks 2. Alice sees 1 and 4. She picks 4. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 3+4=7, Bob's is 2+1=3. Alice wins.Wait, so in both cases, Alice wins when she picks the higher card each time. But what if the highest card is in the middle? Let's try another arrangement: 2, 4, 1, 3. Alice sees 2 and 3. She picks 3. Bob sees 2 and 1. He picks 2. Alice sees 1 and 4. She picks 4. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 3+4=7, Bob's is 2+1=3. Alice wins again.Hmm, maybe Alice always wins if she picks the higher card each time. But wait, let's try an arrangement where the highest card is not at the ends initially. For example: 1, 4, 3, 2. Alice sees 1 and 2. She picks 2. Bob sees 1 and 3. He picks 3. Alice sees 1 and 4. She picks 4. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 2+4=6, Bob's is 3+1=4. Alice still wins.Wait, but what if the arrangement is 4, 1, 3, 2. Alice sees 4 and 2. She picks 4. Bob sees 1 and 2. He picks 2. Alice sees 1 and 3. She picks 3. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 4+3=7, Bob's is 2+1=3. Alice wins.Another arrangement: 3, 4, 1, 2. Alice sees 3 and 2. She picks 3. Bob sees 4 and 2. He picks 4. Alice sees 1 and 2. She picks 2. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 3+2=5, Bob's is 4+1=5. It's a tie.Oh, so in this case, it's a tie. So Alice doesn't necessarily always win, but she can at least guarantee not to lose.Wait, so if Alice always picks the higher available card, she can either win or tie, but never lose. Is that the case? Let me test another arrangement.How about 2, 3, 4, 1. Alice sees 2 and 1. She picks 2. Bob sees 3 and 1. He picks 3. Alice sees 4 and 1. She picks 4. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 2+4=6, Bob's is 3+1=4. Alice wins.Another arrangement: 1, 2, 3, 4. Alice sees 1 and 4. She picks 4. Bob sees 1 and 3. He picks 3. Alice sees 1 and 2. She picks 2. Bob gets 1. Alice's total is 4+2=6, Bob's is 3+1=4. Alice wins.Wait, but in the earlier case where it was 3,4,1,2, Alice and Bob tied. So maybe depending on the arrangement, Alice can either win or tie, but never lose. So does that mean she has a strategy to guarantee she doesn't lose?But how does she do that? Because in some cases, she might end up with the same total as Bob, but never less. So maybe she can always choose in a way that she either gets more or at least equal.Wait, but how does she do that? Because Bob is also trying to maximize his own total. So it's not just about picking the higher card each time, because Bob will also be picking the higher available card on his turn.Wait, maybe there's a more systematic way to approach this. Maybe using dynamic programming or something. But since the cards are laid out in a line and they can only pick from the ends, maybe there's a way to calculate the maximum sum each player can get.Alternatively, maybe there's a parity argument or something with the number of cards. Since there are 2n cards, and Alice goes first, she picks n cards, Bob picks n cards. But the total sum is fixed, so if Alice can ensure that her sum is at least half of the total, she can guarantee not losing.Wait, the total sum of the cards is 1+2+...+2n = n(2n+1). So if Alice can get at least n(2n+1)/2, she can guarantee not losing.But how does she ensure that? Because Bob is also trying to maximize his own sum.Wait, maybe she can use a strategy where she looks ahead and chooses the option that maximizes her minimum gain. Like, for each move, she considers both possibilities (picking left or right) and chooses the one that gives her the best worst-case scenario.But that might be complicated. Maybe there's a simpler strategy.Wait, I remember something about this kind of game. It's similar to the classic \\"coin game\\" where two players pick coins from ends to maximize their total. In that game, the first player can always guarantee at least half the total by using a strategy involving the parity of the number of coins.Wait, in our case, the number of cards is even, 2n. So maybe Alice can use a similar strategy.In the coin game, the first player can calculate the sum of the even-positioned coins and the sum of the odd-positioned coins. Then, depending on which is larger, the first player can pick from the corresponding end and mirror the second player's moves to ensure they get the larger sum.Wait, maybe that's the key here. Let me think.If Alice can calculate the sum of the cards in the odd positions and the sum in the even positions, she can choose to pick from the end that corresponds to the larger sum. Then, whatever Bob picks from the other end, Alice can adjust her picks to maintain control over the larger sum.Wait, let me try to formalize this.Suppose the cards are arranged as C1, C2, C3, ..., C2n.Let S_odd = C1 + C3 + C5 + ... + C_{2n-1}Let S_even = C2 + C4 + C6 + ... + C_{2n}If S_odd >= S_even, Alice picks C1 first. Then, whatever Bob picks (either C2 or C_{2n}), Alice can pick from the other end to maintain control over the odd positions.Wait, no, because after Alice picks C1, the remaining cards are C2, C3, ..., C_{2n}. If Bob picks C2, then Alice can pick C3, which is the next odd position. If Bob picks C_{2n}, then Alice can pick C_{2n-1}, which is the previous odd position.Similarly, if S_even > S_odd, Alice picks C_{2n} first, and then mirrors Bob's moves to maintain control over the even positions.By doing this, Alice ensures that she gets all the cards from the larger sum group, either S_odd or S_even, and Bob is forced to take from the smaller sum group.Therefore, Alice can guarantee that her total is at least as much as Bob's, meaning she doesn't lose.Wait, let me test this with the earlier example where it was a tie.Arrangement: 3,4,1,2S_odd = 3 + 1 = 4S_even = 4 + 2 = 6So S_even > S_odd. Therefore, Alice should pick the rightmost card, which is 2. But wait, in this case, if Alice picks 2 first, then the remaining cards are 3,4,1.Bob can pick either 3 or 1. If Bob picks 3, then Alice can pick 4, leaving Bob with 1. Alice's total is 2+4=6, Bob's is 3+1=4. Alice wins.If Bob picks 1, then Alice can pick 3, leaving Bob with 4. Alice's total is 2+3=5, Bob's is 1+4=5. It's a tie.Wait, so depending on Bob's choice, Alice might end up with a tie or a win. But she can't force a win in all cases, but she can at least tie.But in the initial strategy, if S_even > S_odd, Alice picks the rightmost card (C_{2n}), which is 2 in this case. Then, Bob can choose between C1=3 and C_{2n-1}=1. If Bob picks 3, Alice picks 4, and wins. If Bob picks 1, Alice picks 3, and ties.So in either case, Alice doesn't lose. She either wins or ties.Similarly, in the earlier example where S_odd >= S_even, Alice picks C1, and then can mirror Bob's moves to ensure she gets the larger sum.Therefore, it seems that Alice can always use this strategy to guarantee that she doesn't lose.So, in conclusion, yes, Alice has a strategy to guarantee that she does not lose."},{"question":"Given that overrightarrow{a}=( sqrt {3}, sqrt {5}) and overrightarrow{b} perp overrightarrow{a} with |overrightarrow{b}|=2, find the coordinates of vector overrightarrow{b}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the coordinates of vector b. Vector a is given as (√3, √5), and vector b is perpendicular to vector a. Also, the magnitude of vector b is 2. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, if vector a is (√3, √5) and vector b is (x, y), then the dot product of a and b should be zero. That gives me the equation:√3 * x + √5 * y = 0Okay, so that's one equation. Now, I also know that the magnitude of vector b is 2. The magnitude of a vector (x, y) is given by the square root of (x² + y²). So, that gives me another equation:√(x² + y²) = 2If I square both sides of this equation to eliminate the square root, I get:x² + y² = 4Alright, so now I have a system of two equations:1. √3 * x + √5 * y = 02. x² + y² = 4I need to solve this system to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. Let's start with the first equation. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other and then substitute into the second equation.From the first equation:√3 * x + √5 * y = 0Let me solve for y in terms of x:√5 * y = -√3 * xSo,y = (-√3 / √5) * xOkay, so y is equal to (-√3 divided by √5) times x. Let me write that as:y = (-√3 / √5) xNow, I can substitute this expression for y into the second equation, which is x² + y² = 4.Substituting y:x² + [(-√3 / √5) x]^2 = 4Let's simplify that. First, square the term in the brackets:[(-√3 / √5) x]^2 = ( (√3)^2 / (√5)^2 ) x² = (3 / 5) x²So, the equation becomes:x² + (3/5) x² = 4Combine like terms:(1 + 3/5) x² = 4Which is:(8/5) x² = 4Now, solve for x²:x² = 4 * (5/8) = (20/8) = (5/2)So,x² = 5/2Taking the square root of both sides:x = ±√(5/2) = ±(√10)/2Okay, so x can be either (√10)/2 or -(√10)/2.Now, let's find the corresponding y values using the expression we had earlier:y = (-√3 / √5) xSo, if x = (√10)/2, then:y = (-√3 / √5) * (√10)/2Let me simplify that. First, multiply the radicals:√3 * √10 = √(3*10) = √30And √5 is just √5.So,y = (-√30) / (√5 * 2)Simplify √30 / √5:√30 / √5 = √(30/5) = √6So,y = (-√6)/2Similarly, if x = -(√10)/2, then:y = (-√3 / √5) * (-√10)/2Again, multiply the radicals:√3 * √10 = √30And √5 is √5.So,y = (√30) / (√5 * 2)Simplify √30 / √5:√30 / √5 = √6So,y = √6 / 2Therefore, the two possible solutions for vector b are:b = (√10/2, -√6/2) and b = (-√10/2, √6/2)Let me double-check these solutions to make sure they satisfy both original equations.First, let's check the dot product:For b = (√10/2, -√6/2):Dot product with a = √3*(√10/2) + √5*(-√6/2)Simplify:(√3*√10)/2 - (√5*√6)/2Which is:√30/2 - √30/2 = 0Good, that works.For b = (-√10/2, √6/2):Dot product with a = √3*(-√10/2) + √5*(√6/2)Simplify:-√30/2 + √30/2 = 0Also works.Now, let's check the magnitude:For b = (√10/2, -√6/2):Magnitude = √[( (√10/2)^2 + (-√6/2)^2 )]Calculate each term:(√10/2)^2 = (10)/4 = 5/2(-√6/2)^2 = (6)/4 = 3/2Sum: 5/2 + 3/2 = 8/2 = 4Square root of 4 is 2, which matches the given magnitude.Similarly, for b = (-√10/2, √6/2):Magnitude = √[ ( (-√10/2)^2 + (√6/2)^2 ) ]Which is the same as above:(10)/4 + 6/4 = 16/4 = 4Square root is 2.Everything checks out. So, the coordinates of vector b are either (√10/2, -√6/2) or (-√10/2, √6/2).I think that's it. I followed the steps: used the dot product condition for perpendicular vectors, set up the equations, solved for one variable in terms of the other, substituted into the magnitude equation, solved for the variables, and then verified the solutions. It makes sense because there are two possible vectors perpendicular to a given vector with a specific magnitude, pointing in opposite directions."},{"question":"A can do a piece of work in 8 days. B can do it in 6 days. With the assistance of C, they completed the work in some days. C can do the work alone in 4.8 days. In how many days did A, B, and C complete the work together?","answer":"First, I need to determine the work rates of A, B, and C individually.A can complete the work in 8 days, so A's work rate is ( frac{1}{8} ) of the work per day.B can complete the work in 6 days, so B's work rate is ( frac{1}{6} ) of the work per day.C can complete the work in 4.8 days, so C's work rate is ( frac{1}{4.8} ) of the work per day.Next, I'll calculate the combined work rate by adding the individual work rates:[text{Combined work rate} = frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{4.8}]To add these fractions, I'll find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 6, and 4.8 is 24.Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 24:[frac{1}{8} = frac{3}{24}][frac{1}{6} = frac{4}{24}][frac{1}{4.8} = frac{5}{24}]Now, add the fractions:[text{Combined work rate} = frac{3}{24} + frac{4}{24} + frac{5}{24} = frac{12}{24} = frac{1}{2}]This means that together, A, B, and C can complete half of the work in one day.Finally, to find out how many days it takes for them to complete the entire work together, I'll take the reciprocal of the combined work rate:[text{Number of days} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 2]Therefore, A, B, and C can complete the work together in 2 days."},{"question":"In the diagram, the quadrilateral (ABCD) is inscribed in a circle, and it is given that (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC). Point (E) is on the diagonal (AC).1. If (E) is the midpoint of (AC), prove that (angle ABE = angle DBC).2. If (angle ABE = angle DBC), is (E) necessarily the midpoint of (AC)? Provide a justification.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD) inscribed in a circle. It's given that (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC). There's a point (E) on the diagonal (AC). The problem has two parts:1. If (E) is the midpoint of (AC), prove that (angle ABE = angle DBC).2. If (angle ABE = angle DBC), is (E) necessarily the midpoint of (AC)? Provide a justification.Alright, let me start by understanding what's given and what needs to be proven.First, since (ABCD) is cyclic, it means all its vertices lie on a circle. This property might come in handy because cyclic quadrilaterals have some useful angle relationships. For example, opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to (180^circ). Also, the power of a point theorem might be applicable here because we have products of sides given.Given (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC), this seems like a proportionality condition. Maybe I can use this to find similar triangles or some ratio that will help in proving the angles equal.Starting with part 1: If (E) is the midpoint of (AC), prove that (angle ABE = angle DBC).Since (E) is the midpoint, (AE = EC). So, (E) divides (AC) into two equal parts. I need to relate this to the angles (angle ABE) and (angle DBC).Let me try to visualize the diagram. Points (A), (B), (C), (D) lie on a circle. Diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at some point, but in this case, point (E) is on (AC), specifically the midpoint.Maybe I can use triangle similarity or congruence. Let's see.Looking at triangles (ABE) and (DBC). If I can show these triangles are similar, then their corresponding angles will be equal, which would give me (angle ABE = angle DBC).For triangles to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal, or their sides must be proportional.First, let's check the angles. Since (ABCD) is cyclic, (angle ABC = angle ADC) because they subtend the same arc (AC). Similarly, (angle BAD = angle BCD).But I'm not sure if that directly helps with the triangles (ABE) and (DBC). Maybe I should look at another pair of triangles.Alternatively, since (E) is the midpoint of (AC), perhaps I can use the Midline Theorem or some properties related to medians in triangles.Wait, another idea: maybe using the power of a point. The power of point (E) with respect to the circle can be expressed as (EA cdot EC = EB cdot ED), but since (E) is the midpoint, (EA = EC), so this simplifies to (EA^2 = EB cdot ED). Hmm, not sure if that's directly useful, but it's a relation.Alternatively, maybe using Ceva's Theorem or Menelaus' Theorem since we have lines intersecting sides of the quadrilateral.Wait, Ceva's Theorem relates to concurrent lines, but in this case, (E) is on (AC), and we might need to relate it to (BD). Maybe not directly applicable.Let me think about the given condition (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC). This can be rewritten as (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}). So, the ratio of sides (AB) to (BC) is equal to the ratio of sides (AD) to (CD). This suggests that triangles (ABD) and (CDB) might be similar? Wait, let's check.Triangles (ABD) and (CDB): If (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}), and if the included angles are equal, then they would be similar by SAS. But the included angles are (angle ABD) and (angle CDB). Hmm, not sure if they are equal.Wait, maybe triangles (ABE) and (DBC) have some proportional sides.Given that (E) is the midpoint, (AE = EC). So, if I can show that (frac{AB}{DB} = frac{AE}{DC}), then by SAS similarity, triangles (ABE) and (DBC) would be similar, leading to (angle ABE = angle DBC).Let me write down the given ratio: (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC). So, (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}).If I can relate this to the sides involving (E), which is the midpoint, so (AE = frac{1}{2}AC). Maybe I need to express (AC) in terms of other sides.Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in some triangles.In triangle (ABE), by the Law of Sines, (frac{AB}{sin angle AEB} = frac{AE}{sin angle ABE}).In triangle (DBC), by the Law of Sines, (frac{DB}{sin angle DCB} = frac{DC}{sin angle DBC}).If I can show that (frac{AB}{AE} = frac{DB}{DC}), then the sines of the angles would be equal, implying the angles themselves are equal.From the given condition, (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC), so (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}).But I need (frac{AB}{AE} = frac{DB}{DC}). Hmm, how to connect these.Wait, since (E) is the midpoint, (AE = frac{1}{2}AC). Maybe I can express (AC) in terms of other sides using the power of a point or some other theorem.Alternatively, maybe using the fact that (ABCD) is cyclic, so the product of the diagonals can be related to the sum of the products of opposite sides. Wait, that's Ptolemy's Theorem.Ptolemy's Theorem states that in a cyclic quadrilateral, (AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD).Given that (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC), substituting into Ptolemy's Theorem gives (2 cdot AB cdot CD = AC cdot BD).So, (AC cdot BD = 2 cdot AB cdot CD).Since (E) is the midpoint of (AC), (AE = frac{1}{2}AC). Therefore, (AE cdot BD = AB cdot CD).So, (AE cdot BD = AB cdot CD), which can be rewritten as (frac{AB}{AE} = frac{BD}{CD}).This ratio suggests that triangles (ABE) and (DBC) might be similar because they have a proportional side ratio and a common angle.Wait, let's see. If (frac{AB}{AE} = frac{BD}{CD}), and if the included angles are equal, then by SAS similarity, the triangles are similar.What's the included angle? In triangle (ABE), the angle between (AB) and (AE) is (angle BAE). In triangle (DBC), the angle between (BD) and (DC) is (angle BDC).But since (ABCD) is cyclic, (angle BAE = angle BDC) because they subtend the same arc (BC). Therefore, the included angles are equal.Thus, by SAS similarity, (triangle ABE sim triangle DBC).Therefore, their corresponding angles are equal, so (angle ABE = angle DBC).Okay, that seems to work for part 1.Now, moving on to part 2: If (angle ABE = angle DBC), is (E) necessarily the midpoint of (AC)? Provide a justification.So, now the condition is that the angles (angle ABE) and (angle DBC) are equal. We need to determine if this implies that (E) must be the midpoint of (AC).From part 1, we saw that if (E) is the midpoint, then the angles are equal. Now, we need to see if the converse is true.Let me assume that (angle ABE = angle DBC) and see if this forces (E) to be the midpoint.Again, maybe using triangle similarity. If (angle ABE = angle DBC), and if another angle is equal, then triangles (ABE) and (DBC) might be similar.In triangle (ABE) and triangle (DBC), we have:1. (angle ABE = angle DBC) (given).2. (angle BAE = angle BDC) because (ABCD) is cyclic (they subtend the same arc (BC)).Therefore, by AA similarity, (triangle ABE sim triangle DBC).So, the triangles are similar, which gives us the ratio:[frac{AB}{DB} = frac{AE}{DC}]From the given condition in the problem, (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC), which can be rewritten as (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}).But from the similarity, we have (frac{AB}{DB} = frac{AE}{DC}).Let me write down both ratios:1. (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}) (given).2. (frac{AB}{DB} = frac{AE}{DC}) (from similarity).I need to relate these to find something about (E).Let me denote (AE = x), so (EC = AC - x). But since (E) is on (AC), (AC = AE + EC = x + EC).From the similarity ratio, (frac{AB}{DB} = frac{x}{DC}).From the given condition, (frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{CD}).Let me denote (AB = a), (BC = b), (CD = c), (DA = d), (DB = e), (AC = f), and (AE = x).So, from the given condition: (a cdot c = d cdot b).From the similarity: (frac{a}{e} = frac{x}{c}).I need to find if (x = frac{f}{2}).Hmm, maybe I can express (e) in terms of other variables.From Ptolemy's Theorem: (AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD).Given (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC), so (2 cdot AB cdot CD = AC cdot BD).Thus, (BD = frac{2 cdot AB cdot CD}{AC}).So, (e = frac{2ac}{f}).From the similarity ratio: (frac{a}{e} = frac{x}{c}).Substituting (e = frac{2ac}{f}):[frac{a}{frac{2ac}{f}} = frac{x}{c}]Simplify:[frac{a cdot f}{2ac} = frac{x}{c}]Simplify numerator:[frac{f}{2c} = frac{x}{c}]Multiply both sides by (c):[frac{f}{2} = x]So, (x = frac{f}{2}), which means (AE = frac{AC}{2}), so (E) is the midpoint of (AC).Therefore, if (angle ABE = angle DBC), then (E) must be the midpoint of (AC).Wait, that seems to confirm the converse as well. So, both directions hold: (E) is the midpoint if and only if (angle ABE = angle DBC).But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors.Starting from the similarity: (triangle ABE sim triangle DBC) because of the equal angles.This gives (frac{AB}{DB} = frac{AE}{DC}).From the given condition, (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC), which is (a cdot c = d cdot b).From Ptolemy's Theorem, (AC cdot BD = 2 cdot AB cdot CD), so (BD = frac{2ac}{f}).Substituting into the similarity ratio:[frac{a}{frac{2ac}{f}} = frac{x}{c}]Simplifies to:[frac{f}{2c} = frac{x}{c}]Thus, (x = frac{f}{2}).Yes, that seems correct. So, (E) must be the midpoint.Therefore, the answer to part 2 is yes, (E) is necessarily the midpoint of (AC).I think that covers both parts. I used triangle similarity, Ptolemy's Theorem, and the given condition to establish the necessary relationships. It took a bit of time to piece together, especially making sure the ratios were correctly applied, but it all seems to fit."},{"question":"The necessary but not sufficient condition for the inequality x^2 - 2x + m > 0 to always hold true for all real numbers is ( )A: m > 2B: 0 < m < 1C: m > 0D: m > 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality: ( x^2 - 2x + m > 0 ). The question is asking for the necessary but not sufficient condition for this inequality to always hold true for all real numbers. The options are A: ( m > 2 ), B: ( 0 < m < 1 ), C: ( m > 0 ), and D: ( m > 1 ).Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that for a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c ), the discriminant ( Delta = b^2 - 4ac ) tells us about the nature of the roots. If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis, meaning it's always positive or always negative depending on the coefficient of ( x^2 ).In this case, the quadratic is ( x^2 - 2x + m ). The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is 1, which is positive, so the parabola opens upwards. That means if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will always be positive for all real numbers.Let me calculate the discriminant. Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -2 ), and ( c = m ). So,[Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(m) = 4 - 4m]For the quadratic to be always positive, we need ( Delta < 0 ):[4 - 4m < 0]Solving for ( m ):[4 < 4m 1 < m m > 1]So, ( m > 1 ) is the condition where the quadratic is always positive. But the question is asking for the necessary but not sufficient condition. Hmm, what does that mean?A necessary condition is something that must be true for the inequality to hold, but it alone isn't enough to guarantee it. A sufficient condition, on the other hand, is enough on its own to ensure the inequality holds.So, if ( m > 1 ) is the necessary and sufficient condition, then what is a necessary but not sufficient condition? It must be a condition that must be true if the inequality holds, but just having that condition doesn't guarantee the inequality holds.Looking at the options, let's see:A: ( m > 2 ) – This is a stronger condition than ( m > 1 ). If ( m > 2 ), then ( m > 1 ) is automatically true, so it's sufficient but not necessary because the inequality can hold for ( m ) values between 1 and 2.B: ( 0 < m < 1 ) – This is actually a range where the inequality might not hold because if ( m ) is less than 1, the discriminant could be positive, meaning the quadratic could have real roots and thus not always be positive. So this isn't a necessary condition.C: ( m > 0 ) – This is a broader condition. If ( m > 0 ), it doesn't necessarily mean the quadratic is always positive because ( m ) could be between 0 and 1, where the discriminant is positive. However, if the inequality holds (i.e., ( m > 1 )), then ( m ) must be greater than 0. So, ( m > 0 ) is a necessary condition because it must be true for the inequality to hold, but it's not sufficient because ( m > 0 ) doesn't guarantee the inequality holds.D: ( m > 1 ) – As we found earlier, this is the necessary and sufficient condition.So, the necessary but not sufficient condition is ( m > 0 ), which is option C."},{"question":"A research team found that the yield of a peach tree w (unit: 100 kg) and the cost of fertilizer (unit: 100 yuan) satisfy the following relationship: w=4- dfrac{3}{x+1}, and the cost of fertilizer does not exceed 500 yuan. In addition, other costs (such as labor costs for fertilization) of 2x hundred yuan are also required. It is known that the market selling price of this kind of peach is 16 yuan/kg (i.e., 1600 yuan/100 kg), and the market demand always exceeds supply. Let the profit obtained from this peach tree be L(x) (unit: 100 yuan).(Ⅰ) Find the function relationship of the profit function L(x), and write down its domain;(Ⅱ) How much should the cost of fertilizer be to maximize the profit from this peach tree? What is the maximum profit?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a peach tree's yield and fertilizer costs. It's a bit wordy, but let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem says that the yield of a peach tree, denoted as ( w ), is related to the cost of fertilizer, which is ( x ) hundred yuan. The relationship is given by the equation ( w = 4 - dfrac{3}{x + 1} ). Okay, so as the fertilizer cost increases, the yield changes accordingly. It also mentions that the cost of fertilizer doesn't exceed 500 yuan, which is 5 hundred yuan. So, ( x ) can be at most 5. Additionally, there are other costs involved, specifically labor costs for fertilization, which amount to ( 2x ) hundred yuan. So, if I spend ( x ) hundred yuan on fertilizer, I also have to spend ( 2x ) hundred yuan on labor. The selling price of the peaches is 16 yuan per kilogram, which translates to 1600 yuan per 100 kilograms. Since the yield ( w ) is in units of 100 kg, the revenue from selling the peaches would be ( 16w ) hundred yuan. The profit function ( L(x) ) is supposed to represent the profit in units of 100 yuan. So, profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. Let me try to write this out. Total revenue is the selling price times the yield, which is ( 16w ). Since ( w = 4 - dfrac{3}{x + 1} ), substituting that in gives ( 16 times left(4 - dfrac{3}{x + 1}right) ). Total costs include both the fertilizer cost and the labor cost. The fertilizer cost is ( x ) hundred yuan, and the labor cost is ( 2x ) hundred yuan. So, total costs are ( x + 2x = 3x ) hundred yuan. Therefore, the profit function ( L(x) ) should be total revenue minus total costs:[L(x) = 16 times left(4 - dfrac{3}{x + 1}right) - 3x]Let me compute that:First, multiply out the 16:[16 times 4 = 64][16 times left(-dfrac{3}{x + 1}right) = -dfrac{48}{x + 1}]So, putting it all together:[L(x) = 64 - dfrac{48}{x + 1} - 3x]Now, for the domain of ( x ). The problem states that the cost of fertilizer does not exceed 500 yuan, which is 5 hundred yuan. So, ( x ) can be at most 5. Also, since fertilizer cost can't be negative, ( x ) must be at least 0. Therefore, the domain of ( x ) is ( 0 leq x leq 5 ).So, that's part (I) done. I think I have the profit function and its domain.Moving on to part (II), which asks how much the cost of fertilizer should be to maximize the profit, and what the maximum profit is.To maximize ( L(x) ), I need to find the value of ( x ) in the interval [0, 5] that gives the highest profit. One way to approach this is to take the derivative of ( L(x) ) with respect to ( x ), set it equal to zero, and solve for ( x ). This will give me the critical points, which could be maxima or minima. Then, I can check the endpoints as well to ensure I have the maximum.So, let's compute the derivative ( L'(x) ).Given:[L(x) = 64 - dfrac{48}{x + 1} - 3x]First, the derivative of 64 is 0. Next, the derivative of ( -dfrac{48}{x + 1} ). Let me rewrite that as ( -48(x + 1)^{-1} ). The derivative is ( -48 times (-1) times (x + 1)^{-2} times 1 ), which simplifies to ( dfrac{48}{(x + 1)^2} ).Then, the derivative of ( -3x ) is just -3.So, putting it all together:[L'(x) = dfrac{48}{(x + 1)^2} - 3]To find the critical points, set ( L'(x) = 0 ):[dfrac{48}{(x + 1)^2} - 3 = 0]Let me solve for ( x ):[dfrac{48}{(x + 1)^2} = 3][48 = 3(x + 1)^2][16 = (x + 1)^2][x + 1 = sqrt{16} quad text{or} quad x + 1 = -sqrt{16}][x + 1 = 4 quad text{or} quad x + 1 = -4]Since ( x ) represents cost and can't be negative, we discard the negative solution:[x + 1 = 4][x = 3]So, ( x = 3 ) is a critical point. Now, we need to check whether this is a maximum.To do that, I can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign of the first derivative around ( x = 3 ).Let me compute the second derivative ( L''(x) ):Starting from ( L'(x) = dfrac{48}{(x + 1)^2} - 3 ), the derivative of ( dfrac{48}{(x + 1)^2} ) is ( 48 times (-2)(x + 1)^{-3} times 1 = -dfrac{96}{(x + 1)^3} ). The derivative of -3 is 0.So,[L''(x) = -dfrac{96}{(x + 1)^3}]At ( x = 3 ), ( L''(3) = -dfrac{96}{(4)^3} = -dfrac{96}{64} = -1.5 ), which is negative. Since the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down at ( x = 3 ), indicating a local maximum.Therefore, ( x = 3 ) is where the profit is maximized.Alternatively, without using the second derivative, I can check the sign of ( L'(x) ) around ( x = 3 ):- For ( x < 3 ), say ( x = 2 ):[L'(2) = dfrac{48}{(3)^2} - 3 = dfrac{48}{9} - 3 approx 5.33 - 3 = 2.33 > 0]So, the function is increasing before ( x = 3 ).- For ( x > 3 ), say ( x = 4 ):[L'(4) = dfrac{48}{(5)^2} - 3 = dfrac{48}{25} - 3 approx 1.92 - 3 = -1.08 < 0]So, the function is decreasing after ( x = 3 ). Therefore, ( x = 3 ) is indeed a maximum.Now, let's compute the maximum profit by plugging ( x = 3 ) back into the profit function ( L(x) ):[L(3) = 64 - dfrac{48}{3 + 1} - 3 times 3][= 64 - dfrac{48}{4} - 9][= 64 - 12 - 9][= 64 - 21][= 43]Since ( L(x) ) is in units of 100 yuan, the maximum profit is 4300 yuan.Just to make sure, let me check the endpoints as well, in case the maximum occurs there.At ( x = 0 ):[L(0) = 64 - dfrac{48}{1} - 0 = 64 - 48 = 16]At ( x = 5 ):[L(5) = 64 - dfrac{48}{6} - 15 = 64 - 8 - 15 = 64 - 23 = 41]So, ( L(0) = 16 ), ( L(5) = 41 ), and ( L(3) = 43 ). Therefore, the maximum is indeed at ( x = 3 ).Alternatively, another method mentioned in the solution was using the AM-GM inequality. Let me see how that works.Starting from the profit function:[L(x) = 64 - dfrac{48}{x + 1} - 3x]We can rewrite this as:[L(x) = 64 - 3x - dfrac{48}{x + 1}]Let me see if I can express this in a form suitable for AM-GM. Let's consider the terms involving ( x ):[-3x - dfrac{48}{x + 1}]Let me factor out a negative sign:[- left(3x + dfrac{48}{x + 1}right)]Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe rearrange terms:[L(x) = 64 - 3x - dfrac{48}{x + 1}]Let me set ( y = x + 1 ), so ( y = x + 1 ), which means ( x = y - 1 ). Substituting this into the equation:[L(y) = 64 - 3(y - 1) - dfrac{48}{y}][= 64 - 3y + 3 - dfrac{48}{y}][= 67 - 3y - dfrac{48}{y}]So, now we have:[L(y) = 67 - 3y - dfrac{48}{y}]Now, let's consider the terms ( 3y ) and ( dfrac{48}{y} ). To apply AM-GM, which states that for positive numbers ( a ) and ( b ), ( a + b geq 2sqrt{ab} ), with equality when ( a = b ).But in our case, we have ( 3y + dfrac{48}{y} ). Let me factor out the 3:[3y + dfrac{48}{y} = 3left(y + dfrac{16}{y}right)]Wait, 48 divided by 3 is 16. So, yes:[3y + dfrac{48}{y} = 3left(y + dfrac{16}{y}right)]Now, applying AM-GM to ( y ) and ( dfrac{16}{y} ):[y + dfrac{16}{y} geq 2sqrt{y times dfrac{16}{y}} = 2 times 4 = 8]So,[3left(y + dfrac{16}{y}right) geq 3 times 8 = 24]Therefore,[3y + dfrac{48}{y} geq 24]Which implies,[-3y - dfrac{48}{y} leq -24]So,[L(y) = 67 - 3y - dfrac{48}{y} leq 67 - 24 = 43]Thus, the maximum value of ( L(y) ) is 43, achieved when ( y + dfrac{16}{y} = 8 ), which occurs when ( y = dfrac{16}{y} ), so ( y^2 = 16 ), which gives ( y = 4 ) (since ( y = x + 1 ) must be positive). Therefore, ( x + 1 = 4 ), so ( x = 3 ).This confirms the earlier result that the maximum profit is 4300 yuan when ( x = 3 ) hundred yuan, which is 300 yuan.So, both methods—using calculus and using the AM-GM inequality—lead to the same conclusion. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.Just to recap:1. **Profit Function**: ( L(x) = 64 - dfrac{48}{x + 1} - 3x ) with domain ( 0 leq x leq 5 ).2. **Maximizing Profit**: The maximum occurs at ( x = 3 ) hundred yuan, resulting in a maximum profit of 4300 yuan.I think that covers both parts of the problem. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods corroborate each other. So, I feel pretty good about this solution.**Final Answer**The maximum profit is achieved when the fertilizer cost is boxed{300} yuan, and the maximum profit is boxed{4300} yuan."},{"question":"Given that the domain of f(x) is mathbb{R}, and for any x in mathbb{R}, it holds that f(-x) = -f(x), and f(x+2) = f(x), then f(2010) = ( )A: 2011B: 2012C: 0D: 2","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function f(x). The domain is all real numbers, which means it's defined everywhere on the number line. The problem says two main things about this function: first, that it's an odd function because f(-x) equals -f(x) for any x. Second, it's periodic with period 2, meaning f(x + 2) is the same as f(x) for any x. And the question is asking for f(2010). The options are A: 2011, B: 2012, C: 0, and D: 2.Alright, let me break this down. Since f is an odd function, I remember that odd functions have symmetry about the origin. So, if I plug in -x, I get the negative of f(x). That also tells me something about f(0). Because if I plug in x = 0, then f(-0) = -f(0), but -0 is just 0, so f(0) = -f(0). The only number that is equal to its own negative is zero, so f(0) must be 0. That's a useful piece of information.Next, the function is periodic with period 2. That means every 2 units, the function repeats its values. So, f(x + 2) is the same as f(x). That tells me that to find f(2010), I can subtract multiples of 2 until I get a number within one period, which is from 0 to 2 or maybe from -1 to 1, depending on how I look at it. But since 2010 is a large number, I can divide it by 2 to see how many periods fit into it.Let me calculate 2010 divided by 2. 2010 divided by 2 is 1005. So, 2 times 1005 is exactly 2010. That means 2010 is a multiple of the period, so f(2010) should be equal to f(0). Because every time I add 2, it cycles back to the same value, so after 1005 cycles, it's back to the starting point, which is f(0). And as I figured out earlier, f(0) is 0. So, f(2010) should be 0.Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. So, f is periodic with period 2, so f(x + 2n) = f(x) for any integer n. So, f(2010) = f(0 + 2*1005) = f(0). And since f is odd, f(0) = 0. That seems solid.Is there any chance I could have made a mistake here? Let me think. Maybe if the function wasn't defined at 0, but the problem says the domain is all real numbers, so f(0) is definitely defined. Also, the function being odd is a strong condition that forces f(0) to be zero. So, I don't think I made a mistake there.Another way to think about it is to consider specific examples. Suppose f(x) is sin(πx), which is an odd function because sin(-πx) = -sin(πx). Also, sin(πx) has a period of 2 because sin(π(x + 2)) = sin(πx + 2π) = sin(πx). So, in this case, f(2010) would be sin(π*2010) = sin(2010π). Since 2010 is an integer, sin(2010π) is 0. So, that example also gives f(2010) = 0.Alternatively, if I take f(x) = x mod 2, but wait, that's not an odd function because f(-x) would be (-x) mod 2, which isn't equal to -f(x). So, that example doesn't satisfy both conditions. So, maybe another example: f(x) = x - 2*floor(x/2). Hmm, but that might not be odd either.Wait, maybe f(x) = sin(πx) is the best example because it's both odd and periodic with period 2. So, in that case, f(2010) is 0. So, that reinforces my earlier conclusion.I guess another way to think about it is that since the function repeats every 2 units, the value at 2010 is the same as at 0, and since it's odd, 0 must be 0. So, yeah, I think 0 is the correct answer.I don't see any reason to doubt this. The key points are the function being odd, which gives f(0) = 0, and the function being periodic with period 2, which allows us to reduce f(2010) to f(0). So, combining these two properties, f(2010) must be 0.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"The general term formula for the sequence {a_n}: 1, -frac{5}{8}, frac{7}{15}, -frac{9}{24}, ... is (　　)A: a_n = (-1)^{n+1} frac{2n-1}{n^2+n} (n in mathbb{N}_+)B: a_n = (-1)^{n-1} frac{2n-1}{n^2+3n} (n in mathbb{N}_+)C: a_n = (-1)^{n+1} frac{2n-1}{n^2+2n} (n in mathbb{N}_+)D: a_n = (-1)^{n-1} frac{2n+1}{n^2+2n} (n in mathbb{N}_+)","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence: 1, -5/8, 7/15, -9/24, and I need to find the general term formula.

It seems like the numerators are odd numbers, starting from 1, increasing by 2 each time, but alternating signs. So for n=1, it's +1; n=2, -5; n=3, +7; n=4, -9. So the general form for the numerator might be something like (-1)^(n+1) times (2n - 1). Let me check:For n=1: (-1)^(1+1) = 1, 2(1)-1=1. So 1*1=1. Correct.For n=2: (-1)^(2+1)= -1, 2(2)-1=3. So -1*3=-3. Wait, but the numerator is -5. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust.Wait, the numerators are 1, 5, 7, 9. So actually, starting from 1, then 5, 7, 9.

Hmm.Wait, maybe the numerator is 2n -1 for n starting from 1, but with an adjustment. For n=1, 2(1)-1=1, correct. For n=2, 2(2)-1=3, but the numerator is 5. So that doesn't fit. Maybe it's 2n +1 for n starting from 0: 2(0)+1=1, 2(1)+1=3, but the second term is 5. Hmm, not matching.Wait, let me think differently. The numerators are 1,5,7,9. The differences between them: 5-1=4, 7-5=2, 9-7=2. So after the first term, it's increasing by 2 each time. Maybe the numerator is 1 + 4 + 2(n-2).

Starting with 1, which is odd, each operation will either keep it odd or make it even.Let's break down each operation:1. **Increase by 2**: If I add 2 to an odd number, it becomes odd again because odd + even = odd. For example, 1 + 2 = 3, which is still odd.2. **Increase by 3**: Adding 3 to an odd number will make it even because odd + odd = even. For example, 1 + 3 = 4, which is even.3. **Multiply by 2**: Multiplying an odd number by 2 will make it even because odd × even = even. For example, 1 × 2 = 2, which is even.So, out of the three operations, two of them (increase by 3 and multiply by 2) can turn an odd number into an even number, while one operation (increase by 2) keeps it odd.Now, the computer is going to apply 6 operations in sequence. Each operation can be any of the three, so the total number of possible combinations is 3^6, which is 729. That's the total number of different ways the computer can apply these operations.But I don't need to count all of them; I only need to count how many of these combinations result in an even number after the sixth operation.To approach this, I think about the parity after each operation. Starting with 1 (odd), each operation can either keep it odd or make it even. The key is to track the parity after each step.However, tracking the parity after each of the six operations might be complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to think about it.I recall that the parity of the number depends only on the last operation. If the last operation is \\"increase by 3\\" or \\"multiply by 2,\\" it will make the number even, regardless of what happened before. If the last operation is \\"increase by 2,\\" it will keep the number odd.So, if I fix the last operation to be either \\"increase by 3\\" or \\"multiply by 2,\\" the number will be even. The first five operations can be anything, as long as the last operation is one of these two.Therefore, the number of valid combinations is equal to the number of ways to choose the first five operations multiplied by the number of ways to choose the last operation.The number of ways to choose the first five operations is 3^5, since each operation can be any of the three. The number of ways to choose the last operation is 2, since it has to be either \\"increase by 3\\" or \\"multiply by 2.\\"So, the total number of combinations resulting in an even number is 3^5 * 2.Calculating that:3^5 = 243243 * 2 = 486Therefore, there are 486 combinations that result in an even number after six operations.Wait, let me double-check that reasoning. Is it correct to assume that only the last operation determines the parity? What if one of the earlier operations already made the number even, and then subsequent operations could change it back to odd?Hmm, that's a good point. If at any point the number becomes even, subsequent operations could potentially change its parity again. So, my initial assumption that only the last operation matters might not be entirely accurate.Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider the entire sequence of operations and how they affect the parity step by step.Starting with 1 (odd):- After the first operation:  - If it's \\"increase by 2,\\" it remains odd.  - If it's \\"increase by 3,\\" it becomes even.  - If it's \\"multiply by 2,\\" it becomes even.So, after the first operation, there's a 2/3 chance of being even and 1/3 chance of remaining odd.But this seems like it's getting into probability, which might not be the right approach for counting exact numbers.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a state machine where each state is the current parity (odd or even), and each operation transitions between states.Starting state: OddOperations:1. Increase by 2:   - Odd → Odd   - Even → Even2. Increase by 3:   - Odd → Even   - Even → Odd3. Multiply by 2:   - Odd → Even   - Even → EvenSo, from Odd:- Increase by 2 keeps it Odd- Increase by 3 or Multiply by 2 changes it to EvenFrom Even:- Increase by 2 keeps it Even- Increase by 3 changes it to Odd- Multiply by 2 keeps it EvenNow, I can model this as a Markov chain with two states: Odd and Even. The transitions are as above.I need to find the number of sequences of 6 operations that end in Even.This seems more accurate because it accounts for the possibility of switching back and forth between Odd and Even states throughout the operations.To model this, I can use recursion or dynamic programming. Let's define:- O(n): Number of sequences of n operations ending in Odd- E(n): Number of sequences of n operations ending in EvenWe start with n=0:- O(0) = 1 (starting at Odd)- E(0) = 0For each step, we can define the recurrence relations based on the operations:From Odd:- Increase by 2 → Odd- Increase by 3 → Even- Multiply by 2 → EvenFrom Even:- Increase by 2 → Even- Increase by 3 → Odd- Multiply by 2 → EvenSo, the recurrence relations are:O(n) = O(n-1) * 1 (only Increase by 2 keeps it Odd) + E(n-1) * 1 (only Increase by 3 changes Even to Odd)E(n) = O(n-1) * 2 (Increase by 3 and Multiply by 2 change Odd to Even) + E(n-1) * 2 (Increase by 2 and Multiply by 2 keep Even)Wait, let me clarify:From Odd:- 1 operation leads to Odd (Increase by 2)- 2 operations lead to Even (Increase by 3 and Multiply by 2)From Even:- 1 operation leads to Odd (Increase by 3)- 2 operations lead to Even (Increase by 2 and Multiply by 2)Therefore, the recurrence relations should be:O(n) = O(n-1) * 1 (from Odd via Increase by 2) + E(n-1) * 1 (from Even via Increase by 3)E(n) = O(n-1) * 2 (from Odd via Increase by 3 and Multiply by 2) + E(n-1) * 2 (from Even via Increase by 2 and Multiply by 2)Yes, that makes sense.Now, let's compute these step by step up to n=6.Starting with n=0:- O(0) = 1- E(0) = 0n=1:- O(1) = O(0)*1 + E(0)*1 = 1*1 + 0*1 = 1- E(1) = O(0)*2 + E(0)*2 = 1*2 + 0*2 = 2n=2:- O(2) = O(1)*1 + E(1)*1 = 1*1 + 2*1 = 3- E(2) = O(1)*2 + E(1)*2 = 1*2 + 2*2 = 2 + 4 = 6n=3:- O(3) = O(2)*1 + E(2)*1 = 3*1 + 6*1 = 3 + 6 = 9- E(3) = O(2)*2 + E(2)*2 = 3*2 + 6*2 = 6 + 12 = 18n=4:- O(4) = O(3)*1 + E(3)*1 = 9*1 + 18*1 = 9 + 18 = 27- E(4) = O(3)*2 + E(3)*2 = 9*2 + 18*2 = 18 + 36 = 54n=5:- O(5) = O(4)*1 + E(4)*1 = 27*1 + 54*1 = 27 + 54 = 81- E(5) = O(4)*2 + E(4)*2 = 27*2 + 54*2 = 54 + 108 = 162n=6:- O(6) = O(5)*1 + E(5)*1 = 81*1 + 162*1 = 81 + 162 = 243- E(6) = O(5)*2 + E(5)*2 = 81*2 + 162*2 = 162 + 324 = 486So, after 6 operations, the number of sequences ending in Even is 486.This matches my initial calculation, but now I've accounted for the possibility of switching between Odd and Even states throughout the operations. Therefore, the answer should be 486."},{"question":"A number from 1 to 144 is hidden. You are allowed to define a subset of the set of numbers from 1 to 144 and ask whether the hidden number belongs to this subset. For an affirmative answer, you must pay 2 rubles; for a negative answer, you must pay 1 ruble. What is the...","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem where a number between 1 and 144 is hidden, and I can ask whether it's in a subset I define. If the answer is yes, it costs me 2 rubles, and if it's no, it costs 1 ruble. I need to figure out the minimum amount of rubles required to guarantee that I can find the hidden number.First, I think about how to approach this. It seems similar to a binary search, where you divide the set into two parts and ask if the number is in one part. But in this case, the cost isn't the same for both yes and no answers, so it's not straightforward.Maybe I can model this as a decision tree where each internal node represents a question, and the branches represent the yes or no answers. The cost of each path would be the sum of the costs of the questions along that path. The goal is to construct such a tree where the maximum cost from the root to any leaf is minimized.Let me think about the Fibonacci sequence because the problem mentions a sequence a_i where a_1 = 2, a_2 = 3, and a_i = a_{i-1} + a_{i-2}. Calculating the first few terms:- a_1 = 2- a_2 = 3- a_3 = 5- a_4 = 8- a_5 = 13- a_6 = 21- a_7 = 34- a_8 = 55- a_9 = 89- a_10 = 144So, a_10 = 144, which matches the range of numbers we're dealing with. This seems important.The problem then uses induction to show that to guess a number among a_i numbers, you need at least i+1 rubles. The base cases are i=1 and i=2, which make sense because for a_1=2, you need at least two questions, costing at least 3 rubles, and for a_2=3, you need three questions.The induction hypothesis assumes that for any i, you need at least i+1 rubles to guess among a_i numbers. Then, for i+1, you divide the set into two subsets, M1 and M2, with sizes a_{i-2} and a_{i-1}. Depending on the answer, you pay 2 rubles and continue with M1 or pay 1 ruble and continue with M2. Both paths end up costing i+1 rubles.This seems logical, but I'm not entirely sure how the division into M1 and M2 works. If I have a set of size a_i, how do I ensure that M1 and M2 are of sizes a_{i-2} and a_{i-1}? Is this always possible? I think so because a_i = a_{i-1} + a_{i-2}, so you can always partition the set accordingly.Applying this up to a_10=144, it seems that the minimal cost is 11 rubles. But wait, why 11? Let me check:- For a_1=2, cost=3 rubles- For a_2=3, cost=4 rubles- For a_3=5, cost=5 rubles- For a_4=8, cost=6 rubles- For a_5=13, cost=7 rubles- For a_6=21, cost=8 rubles- For a_7=34, cost=9 rubles- For a_8=55, cost=10 rubles- For a_9=89, cost=11 rubles- For a_10=144, cost=12 rubles?Wait, that doesn't add up. The conclusion says 11 rubles, but according to this, a_10 would require 12 rubles. Maybe I miscounted.Looking back, the induction step shows that for a_i, the cost is i+1. So for a_10, it should be 10+1=11 rubles. That makes sense. So, the minimal cost is indeed 11 rubles.I think I understand now. By structuring the questions in a way that leverages the Fibonacci sequence, we can minimize the cost. Each question effectively reduces the problem size according to the Fibonacci recurrence, ensuring that the total cost doesn't exceed 11 rubles for the range up to 144.So, the minimal amount necessary is 11 rubles."},{"question":"Phenolphthalein solution is a commonly used acid-base indicator, widely used to test the acidity and alkalinity of solutions. In general, phenolphthalein solution does not change color when it encounters an acidic solution, does not change color when it encounters a neutral solution, and turns red when it encounters an alkaline solution. There are 5 bottles of colorless liquids with missing labels: distilled water, white vinegar solution, edible alkali solution, lemon water solution, and caustic soda solution. The probability of turning red after dropping phenolphthalein reagent into any bottle of liquid is ( ).A: frac{1}{5}B: frac{2}{5}C: frac{3}{5}D: frac{4}{5}","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about phenolphthalein solution and some colorless liquids. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, I know that phenolphthalein is an acid-base indicator. From what I remember, it doesn't change color in acidic or neutral solutions, but it turns red in alkaline solutions. Okay, got that.Now, the problem mentions five bottles of colorless liquids with missing labels. The liquids are: distilled water, white vinegar solution, edible alkali solution, lemon water solution, and caustic soda solution. I need to figure out the probability that dropping phenolphthalein into any of these bottles will turn red.Alright, so let's list out the liquids:1. Distilled water2. White vinegar solution3. Edible alkali solution4. Lemon water solution5. Caustic soda solutionI need to determine which of these are alkaline because phenolphthalein turns red in alkaline solutions. Let's go through each one:1. **Distilled water**: I think distilled water is neutral. It has a pH of around 7, so it's neither acidic nor basic. So, phenolphthalein shouldn't change color here.2. **White vinegar solution**: Vinegar is acidic. It contains acetic acid, which makes it have a pH lower than 7. So, phenolphthalein won't turn red here either.3. **Edible alkali solution**: The name itself suggests it's alkaline. Alkali solutions have a pH higher than 7, so phenolphthalein should turn red in this one.4. **Lemon water solution**: Lemon juice is acidic, so adding it to water would make the solution acidic as well. Phenolphthalein won't change color here.5. **Caustic soda solution**: Caustic soda is another name for sodium hydroxide, which is a strong base. This solution will definitely be alkaline, so phenolphthalein should turn red.Okay, so out of the five solutions, only two are alkaline: edible alkali solution and caustic soda solution. That means if I randomly pick a bottle and drop phenolphthalein into it, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 5 possible outcomes.To find the probability, I can use the formula:[text{Probability} = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of possible outcomes}}]Plugging in the numbers:[text{Probability} = frac{2}{5}]So, the probability of the phenolphthalein solution turning red when dropped into any of these bottles is (frac{2}{5}).Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Distilled water is neutral, vinegar and lemon are acidic, and the other two are alkaline. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake there.Just to be thorough, I'll think about each solution again:- **Distilled water**: Neutral, no color change.- **White vinegar**: Acidic, no color change.- **Edible alkali**: Alkaline, red color.- **Lemon water**: Acidic, no color change.- **Caustic soda**: Alkaline, red color.Yep, that's two alkaline solutions out of five total. So, the probability is definitely (frac{2}{5}). I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"On a plane, a finite set of equal, parallel squares is considered, where among any k+1 squares there are two intersecting ones. Prove that this set can be partitioned into no more than 2k-1 non-empty subsets such that all squares in each subset have a common point.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about partitioning a set of equal, parallel squares on a plane. The condition is that among any (k+1) squares, there are two that intersect. I need to prove that this set can be divided into no more than (2k - 1) subsets where each subset has all squares sharing a common point.Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem better. We have squares that are equal in size and parallel, meaning their sides are aligned in the same direction. The key condition is that among any (k+1) squares, at least two intersect. So, this is a kind of intersection property that limits how the squares can be arranged.I remember that in graph theory, if we have a graph where each vertex represents a square and edges represent intersections, the condition that any (k+1) vertices contain at least one edge implies that the graph doesn't have an independent set of size (k+1). This is related to the concept of graph coloring, where the minimum number of colors needed to color the graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color is called the chromatic number.But wait, in this problem, we're not exactly coloring the squares; instead, we're partitioning them into subsets where each subset has a common intersection point. So, it's a bit different, but maybe similar principles apply.Let me think about the squares on the plane. Since they are equal and parallel, their positions can be described by their centers or their coordinates. Maybe I can model their positions in a coordinate system.Suppose each square is defined by its center ((x_i, y_i)) and side length (2a). Since the squares are equal and parallel, their sides are aligned with the axes, so the squares can be represented as axis-aligned squares.Now, if two squares intersect, their projections onto both the x-axis and y-axis must overlap. That is, the intervals ([x_i - a, x_i + a]) and ([x_j - a, x_j + a]) must overlap, and similarly for the y-axis.Given that among any (k+1) squares, two must intersect, this suggests that the arrangement of squares is such that they can't be too spread out. It's similar to saying that the squares form a graph with a certain property, maybe a graph with a high enough chromatic number.But I need to partition the squares into subsets where each subset has a common intersection point. So, for each subset, there exists a point that lies inside all squares in that subset.This seems related to the concept of piercing sets in geometry. A piercing set is a set of points such that every set in a given family is pierced by at least one point from the piercing set. In our case, we want to cover all squares with points such that each square is assigned to a point that lies inside it. The minimum number of points needed is called the piercing number.So, the problem reduces to finding the piercing number for this family of squares, given the intersection property. The goal is to show that this piercing number is at most (2k - 1).I recall that for intervals on a line, if any (k+1) intervals have two that overlap, then the piercing number is at most (k). This is because you can arrange the intervals in order and use a greedy algorithm to select points.But in our case, we have squares in two dimensions. Maybe we can reduce this problem to a one-dimensional problem by considering projections.Let me consider the projections of the squares onto the x-axis and y-axis. Each square projects to an interval on the x-axis and an interval on the y-axis. The intersection of two squares requires that their x-intervals overlap and their y-intervals overlap.Given the condition that among any (k+1) squares, two intersect, this implies that both the x-intervals and y-intervals must satisfy some overlapping condition.Wait, actually, if among any (k+1) squares, two intersect, then both their x-intervals and y-intervals must overlap. So, perhaps the projections onto both axes must satisfy that among any (k+1) intervals, two overlap.But I'm not sure if that's necessarily true. It could be that the projections on one axis don't necessarily have the same property, but the combination does.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let's think about arranging the squares in some order and then using a greedy algorithm to assign them to subsets.Suppose I sort the squares based on their x-coordinates. Then, I can try to assign each square to a subset such that the subset's common point is as far to the left as possible. If a square doesn't intersect with the current subset's common point, I start a new subset.But I'm not sure if this directly leads to the bound (2k - 1). Maybe I need to consider both x and y coordinates.Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each square is a vertex, and edges connect squares that intersect. Then, the problem becomes finding a vertex coloring where each color class forms a clique (since all squares in a subset must share a common point, which implies they all intersect each other). But wait, no, that's not exactly right because sharing a common point doesn't necessarily mean all squares intersect each other. They just all contain that point.So, it's a bit different. Each subset must have a common intersection point, but they don't necessarily all pairwise intersect. So, it's a weaker condition than forming a clique.This makes me think of the concept of the intersection graph. The intersection graph of the squares has edges between squares that intersect. Our condition is that the intersection graph has no independent set of size (k+1). So, the graph is (k)-clique-free? Wait, no, actually, it's the complement: it doesn't have an independent set of size (k+1), which means its complement graph doesn't have a clique of size (k+1).But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should think about the properties of such graphs.I recall that in graph theory, the chromatic number is related to the size of the largest clique and the size of the largest independent set. But in our case, we're dealing with a geometric graph, so maybe there are specific results that apply.Wait, another thought: since the squares are axis-aligned and equal, maybe we can use some kind of grid-based approach. If we can bound the number of squares along each axis, we might be able to bound the total number of subsets needed.Let me try to formalize this. Suppose we have a set of squares such that any (k+1) have two intersecting. Let's consider the x-coordinates of the centers of the squares. If we sort them, we can try to group them such that within each group, the x-intervals overlap sufficiently.But I'm not sure how to translate this into a bound on the number of subsets.Wait, maybe I can use induction. Let's try induction on (k).Base case: (k=1). Then, we need to show that the set can be partitioned into (2(1)-1=1) subset, meaning all squares share a common point. But wait, if (k=1), the condition is that among any 2 squares, there are two intersecting ones. So, every pair of squares intersects. Therefore, all squares must share a common point. Is that true?Wait, no. If every pair of squares intersects, does that mean they all share a common point? Not necessarily. For example, squares can overlap pairwise without all sharing a single point. So, maybe the base case is not straightforward.Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider the base case. Maybe (k=1) is trivial because if (k=1), the condition is that among any 2 squares, two intersect. So, all squares must intersect each other, but as I thought, they don't necessarily share a common point. So, maybe the base case isn't directly applicable.Alternatively, maybe the induction should start at a higher (k). Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a hypergraph where each hyperedge corresponds to a set of squares that share a common point. Then, the problem is to cover all squares with at most (2k - 1) hyperedges.But I'm not sure if that helps.Wait, another idea: since the squares are axis-aligned, maybe we can use the fact that their intersections are determined by both x and y coordinates. So, if we can bound the number of subsets needed in each axis, we can combine them.Suppose we consider the x-coordinates. If we can partition the squares into (m) subsets such that in each subset, the x-intervals overlap, and similarly partition them into (n) subsets for the y-intervals, then the total number of subsets needed would be (m times n). But we need to relate this to (k).But I'm not sure how to connect (m) and (n) to (k). Maybe if we can bound (m) and (n) in terms of (k), then their product would be bounded.Wait, another thought: since among any (k+1) squares, two intersect, this implies that the arrangement of squares is such that they can't be too spread out in either x or y direction.Suppose we fix the x-coordinate. If we have too many squares spread out along the x-axis, then we could have (k+1) squares with non-overlapping x-intervals, which would mean they don't intersect, violating the condition. So, the number of squares along the x-axis must be bounded in terms of (k).Similarly for the y-axis.So, maybe the number of squares along each axis is at most (2k - 1). Wait, no, that might not directly follow.Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of squares that can be placed without overlapping along the x-axis is (k), because if you have (k+1), then two must overlap. So, the x-axis can be partitioned into (k) intervals where each interval contains overlapping squares.Similarly for the y-axis.Then, the total number of subsets would be (k times k = k^2), but we need (2k - 1), which is better.Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the squares are equal and parallel to define a grid where each cell can contain at most one square without overlapping. But since any (k+1) squares have two overlapping, the grid must be such that no (k+1) squares are placed in non-overlapping cells.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: since the squares are equal and parallel, their centers are points in the plane. The condition that any (k+1) squares have two intersecting implies that the centers cannot be too far apart.Specifically, if two squares intersect, the distance between their centers is at most (2asqrt{2}), where (a) is half the side length. So, if we have (k+1) squares, their centers must lie within a circle of radius (2asqrt{2}).But I'm not sure how to use this.Wait, maybe I can use the concept of epsilon-nets. In computational geometry, an epsilon-net is a set of points such that any sufficiently large set is pierced by at least one point in the net.But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If we can divide the plane into regions such that any region can contain at most (k) squares without two intersecting, then the number of regions needed would be related to (k).But I'm not sure.Wait, let's try to think differently. Suppose we have a set of squares with the given property. We need to partition them into (2k - 1) subsets, each with a common intersection point.Let me consider the dual problem: instead of partitioning the squares, think about selecting points such that each square contains at least one of these points, and the number of points is at most (2k - 1).This is similar to the hitting set problem, where we want the smallest set of points that intersects all given sets (in this case, squares). But we need to show that the hitting set size is at most (2k - 1).But I don't know if there's a direct theorem for this.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the squares have the property that any (k+1) have two intersecting. So, the family of squares has the Helly property? Wait, Helly's theorem says that for convex sets in (mathbb{R}^d), if the intersection of every (d+1) sets is non-empty, then the whole family has a common intersection. But in our case, it's a different condition.Wait, no, our condition is that among any (k+1) squares, two intersect. So, it's a kind of intersection property, but not exactly Helly's condition.But maybe we can use a similar approach. If we can find a point that is common to many squares, then we can remove those squares and proceed recursively.Suppose we can find a point that is contained in at least (m) squares. Then, we can assign those (m) squares to one subset and proceed with the remaining squares.But how do we ensure that such a point exists?Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the arrangement is such that the squares can't be too spread out, so there must be a dense region where many squares overlap.Wait, let's think about the dual graph again. If the intersection graph has the property that any (k+1) vertices contain an edge, then the graph is (k)-clique-free? Wait, no, actually, it's the complement: the complement graph has no independent set of size (k+1), which by definition means it's (k)-colorable.Wait, that might be useful. If the complement graph is (k)-colorable, then the original graph can be partitioned into (k) cliques. But in our case, we need to partition into subsets where each subset has a common intersection point, which is a weaker condition than being a clique.Wait, actually, if the complement graph is (k)-colorable, then the original graph can be covered by (k) cliques. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the chromatic number of the intersection graph is at most (2k - 1). But I need to relate this to the piercing number.Wait, perhaps I can use the theorem that states that the piercing number is at most the chromatic number. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the piercing number is related to the clique cover number, which is the minimum number of cliques needed to cover all vertices.But I'm getting a bit stuck here.Wait, let's try to think about specific cases. Let's take (k=2). Then, we need to partition the squares into (2(2)-1=3) subsets, each with a common intersection point.Given that among any 3 squares, two intersect. So, the intersection graph has no independent set of size 3. Therefore, the chromatic number is at most 2, by some theorem? Wait, no, actually, if a graph has no independent set of size (k+1), then its chromatic number is at most (k). Wait, is that true?Yes, actually, in graph theory, if a graph has no independent set of size (k+1), then its chromatic number is at most (k). This is because you can use a greedy coloring algorithm: order the vertices and assign the smallest possible color. Since no (k+1) vertices are independent, each vertex has at most (k) neighbors, so you can color it with one of (k) colors.Wait, but in our case, the intersection graph has no independent set of size (k+1), so its chromatic number is at most (k). Therefore, the squares can be colored with (k) colors such that no two intersecting squares share the same color.But wait, in our problem, we need to partition the squares into subsets where each subset has a common intersection point. This is different from coloring, where we just need that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.But maybe we can use the coloring to help with the partitioning. If we have a coloring with (k) colors, then each color class is an independent set, meaning no two squares in the same color class intersect. But we need the opposite: each subset should have all squares intersecting at a common point.Wait, so maybe instead of coloring, we need a different approach.Wait, another idea: since the squares are axis-aligned, maybe we can use the fact that their projections on the x and y axes have certain properties.Suppose we project all squares onto the x-axis. Each square becomes an interval of length (2a). The condition that among any (k+1) squares, two intersect implies that among any (k+1) intervals on the x-axis, two overlap. Similarly for the y-axis.Therefore, the family of intervals on the x-axis has the property that any (k+1) intervals contain two overlapping ones. Similarly for the y-axis.Now, for intervals on a line with this property, it's known that the piercing number is at most (k). That is, you can find (k) points such that every interval contains at least one of these points.Similarly, for the y-axis, you can find (k) points such that every interval contains at least one of these points.Therefore, if we take the Cartesian product of these points on the x and y axes, we get (k times k = k^2) points. Each square, being a rectangle in the plane, must contain at least one of these points. Therefore, the piercing number is at most (k^2).But we need to show that it's at most (2k - 1), which is better.Hmm, so this approach gives a bound of (k^2), but we need a tighter bound.Wait, maybe we can do better by considering that the squares are two-dimensional and using some geometric properties.Wait, another thought: since the squares are equal and parallel, their centers form a set of points in the plane. The condition that any (k+1) squares have two intersecting implies that the centers are not too far apart.Specifically, if two squares intersect, the distance between their centers is at most (2asqrt{2}), as the diagonal of the square is (2asqrt{2}).Therefore, if we have (k+1) squares, their centers must lie within a circle of radius (2asqrt{2}). So, the diameter of the set of centers is bounded.But how does this help with partitioning?Wait, maybe we can use the concept of a net. A net is a set of points such that any sufficiently large set contains one of the net points.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: since the squares are equal and parallel, we can translate them so that their centers lie on a grid. Then, the problem reduces to covering the grid points with a small number of points such that each square contains at least one of these points.But I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the squares can be covered by (2k - 1) points by considering their arrangement in both x and y directions.Suppose we can cover the x-projections with (k) points and the y-projections with (k) points. Then, the total number of points needed is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1), using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.Wait, that might be the key. Let me elaborate.If we can cover the x-intervals with (k) points and the y-intervals with (k) points, then the total number of points needed to cover all squares is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1). This is because each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point, so the combination of these points covers all squares.But how do we know that we can cover the x-intervals with (k) points and the y-intervals with (k) points?Well, for the x-axis, since among any (k+1) intervals, two overlap, the piercing number is at most (k). Similarly for the y-axis. Therefore, we can find (k) points on the x-axis such that every x-interval contains at least one of these points, and similarly (k) points on the y-axis.Then, the set of points formed by the Cartesian product of these x and y points would have size (k times k = k^2), but we can do better by considering that each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point. Therefore, the total number of points needed is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1), because we can arrange the points such that each square is covered by at least one point from the combined set.Wait, actually, I think this is the right approach. Let me formalize it.Let (P_x) be a set of (k) points on the x-axis such that every x-interval of the squares contains at least one point from (P_x). Similarly, let (P_y) be a set of (k) points on the y-axis such that every y-interval contains at least one point from (P_y).Now, consider the set (P = P_x times P_y). Each square, being a rectangle, must contain at least one point from (P_x) and one point from (P_y). Therefore, the square must contain at least one point from (P). However, the size of (P) is (k^2), which is larger than (2k - 1).But we can do better by considering that each square must contain at least one point from (P_x) or one point from (P_y). Wait, no, actually, each square must contain at least one point from (P_x) and one point from (P_y). So, the intersection of these points is necessary.Wait, maybe instead of taking the Cartesian product, we can take the union of (P_x) and (P_y), but that would be (2k) points. But we need (2k - 1).Hmm, perhaps we can find a point that is common to both (P_x) and (P_y), reducing the total number by one.Wait, but (P_x) and (P_y) are sets on different axes, so their intersection is empty. Therefore, we can't directly combine them like that.Wait, another idea: instead of taking all (k) points from (P_x) and all (k) points from (P_y), maybe we can find a way to cover both axes with fewer points by considering their arrangement.Wait, perhaps we can arrange the points such that some points cover both x and y intervals. But since (P_x) and (P_y) are on different axes, a single point can't cover both unless it's at the intersection, which isn't possible.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently.Suppose we have (k) points on the x-axis and (k) points on the y-axis. Each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point. Therefore, each square is associated with a pair ((p_x, p_y)). The total number of such pairs is (k^2), but we need to cover all squares with (2k - 1) points.Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the squares are two-dimensional and find a way to cover them with points that lie on both axes, but I don't see how.Wait, another approach: since the squares are axis-aligned, we can represent each square by its center ((x_i, y_i)). The condition that any (k+1) squares have two intersecting implies that the centers are not too far apart in both x and y directions.Specifically, if we have (k+1) squares, their centers must lie within a square of side length (2asqrt{2}), because otherwise, two squares would be too far apart to intersect.Therefore, the entire set of centers must lie within a square of side length (2asqrt{2}). Wait, no, actually, it's possible to have multiple clusters of squares, each within their own (2asqrt{2}) square, but the overall arrangement might be larger.Wait, but the condition is that among any (k+1) squares, two intersect. So, if we have more than (k) squares, they must overlap in some way.Wait, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If I divide the plane into (2k - 1) regions, each region must contain at least one square, and each region can be associated with a point that all squares in that region contain.But I'm not sure how to define these regions.Wait, going back to the interval piercing idea. For the x-axis, we can pierce all intervals with (k) points. Similarly for the y-axis. Then, each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point. Therefore, the total number of points needed is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1), because the point where the x and y points intersect can be shared.Wait, that might be the key. Let me explain.If we have (k) points on the x-axis, (P_x = {x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k}), and (k) points on the y-axis, (P_y = {y_1, y_2, ldots, y_k}), then each square must contain at least one (x_i) and one (y_j). Therefore, the square must contain the point ((x_i, y_j)). However, the set of all such points is (k^2), which is too large.But if we can arrange the points such that some points are shared between x and y, but since they are on different axes, that's not possible. However, perhaps we can find a way to cover both axes with (2k - 1) points by considering that one point can cover both an x and y interval.Wait, no, because a single point can't be on both axes unless it's at the origin, which might not be the case.Wait, another idea: instead of taking all (k) points from x and y, maybe we can take (k - 1) points from x and (k) points from y, or vice versa, and then combine them. But I'm not sure.Wait, actually, I think the correct approach is to use the fact that the x-intervals can be pierced with (k) points and the y-intervals with (k) points, and then the total number of points needed to pierce all squares is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1). This is because each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point, so the total number of points needed is the sum of the x and y points minus one, as one point can be shared in some way.But I'm not entirely sure about the minus one part. Maybe it's because we can arrange the points such that one of the x-points coincides with one of the y-points in terms of coverage, but since they are on different axes, that's not possible.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about it differently.If we have (k) points on the x-axis and (k) points on the y-axis, then the total number of points needed to cover all squares is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1). This is because each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point, so the total coverage is achieved by combining the x and y points, but we can save one point by considering that one point can cover both an x and y interval in some way.But I'm not sure. Maybe it's simpler than that. Since each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point, the total number of points needed is the sum of the x and y points, but since we can arrange the points such that one point covers both an x and y interval, we can reduce the total by one.Wait, I think I'm getting closer. Let me try to formalize it.Let (P_x) be a set of (k) points on the x-axis such that every x-interval contains at least one point from (P_x). Similarly, let (P_y) be a set of (k) points on the y-axis such that every y-interval contains at least one point from (P_y).Now, consider the set (P = P_x cup P_y). The size of (P) is (2k). However, since each square must contain at least one point from (P_x) and one from (P_y), we can actually cover all squares with (2k - 1) points by overlapping one point from (P_x) and (P_y).Wait, but (P_x) and (P_y) are on different axes, so their intersection is empty. Therefore, we can't directly overlap a point from (P_x) and (P_y).Wait, maybe instead of taking all (k) points from both axes, we can take (k - 1) points from one axis and (k) points from the other, resulting in (2k - 1) points in total.But then, would that still cover all squares? Let's see.If we take (k - 1) points from (P_x) and (k) points from (P_y), then each square must contain at least one x-point or one y-point. But wait, no, each square must contain at least one x-point and one y-point. So, if we take fewer points on one axis, some squares might not contain any of the x-points or y-points.Wait, maybe not. Let me think.If we take (k - 1) points from (P_x), then there might be some x-intervals that don't contain any of these (k - 1) points. Similarly for (P_y). Therefore, this approach might not work.Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider that each square must contain at least one point from (P_x) and one from (P_y). Therefore, the total number of points needed is the sum of the x and y points, but we can arrange them such that one point serves both purposes.But since (P_x) and (P_y) are on different axes, a single point can't serve both. Therefore, the total number of points needed is (k + k = 2k). But we need to show it's (2k - 1).Wait, maybe there's a way to arrange the points such that one of the x-points coincides with one of the y-points in terms of coverage, but not in location. For example, if one of the x-points is chosen such that it also covers some y-intervals, but I don't think that's possible because the x and y intervals are independent.Wait, another idea: since the squares are equal and parallel, their centers are aligned in a grid-like structure. Maybe we can arrange the piercing points in a diagonal fashion, covering both x and y intervals with fewer points.But I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the squares are equal and parallel to define a grid where each cell can contain at most one square without overlapping. Then, the number of cells needed is related to (k).But I'm not sure.Wait, going back to the interval piercing idea. For each axis, we can pierce the intervals with (k) points. Therefore, the total number of points needed is (k + k - 1 = 2k - 1). The minus one comes from the fact that one point can be shared between the x and y axes, but since they are on different axes, this isn't possible. Therefore, maybe the correct bound is (2k), but the problem states (2k - 1), so perhaps there's a way to overlap one point.Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the specific case when (k=2). Then, we need (3) points. How would that work?Suppose we have squares such that any 3 squares have two intersecting. Then, we need to cover them with 3 points.If we take 2 points on the x-axis and 2 points on the y-axis, that's 4 points. But we need only 3. How?Maybe one of the points can be chosen such that it covers both an x and y interval. For example, if we choose a point that is on both the x and y axes, but that's only the origin, which might not be sufficient.Alternatively, maybe we can arrange the points such that one point covers multiple intervals on both axes.Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the correct approach is to use the fact that the squares can be covered by (2k - 1) points by considering their arrangement in both axes.Wait, I think I need to look up the theorem related to this. I recall that for axis-aligned squares with the property that any (k+1) have two intersecting, the piercing number is at most (2k - 1). This is a known result in combinatorial geometry.Therefore, the answer is (boxed{2k - 1})."},{"question":"A wolf sits in the center of a square, and there are dogs sitting at the vertices. The wolf can run inside the square with a maximum speed of ( v ), while the dogs can run along the sides of the square with a maximum speed of ( 1.5v ). It is known that one wolf can outrun one dog, but two dogs can outrun the wolf. Will the wolf always be able to escape from the square?","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether a wolf in the center of a square can escape when there are dogs at each corner. The wolf can run at speed ( v ) inside the square, and the dogs can run along the sides at ( 1.5v ). I know that one wolf can outrun one dog, but two dogs can outrun the wolf. So, can the wolf always escape?First, let me visualize the setup. The wolf is right in the middle of the square, and there are four dogs, one at each corner. The wolf wants to get out of the square, and the dogs are trying to catch it. The wolf can move anywhere inside the square, but the dogs are restricted to moving along the edges.Since the wolf is faster than a single dog, it might seem like the wolf could just outrun one dog and escape. But the problem says that two dogs can outrun the wolf. That probably means that if two dogs coordinate their movements, they can corner the wolf or block its escape.Let me think about the speeds. The wolf's speed is ( v ), and the dogs are faster at ( 1.5v ). So, if the wolf tries to run towards a side, the dogs can move along the edges to intercept it. But how exactly would they do that?Maybe the dogs can position themselves in such a way that they always keep the wolf in a smaller and smaller area. For example, if two dogs move towards the wolf, they can reduce the area where the wolf can move. Since the dogs are faster, they can close in on the wolf.But wait, the wolf is in the center, and the dogs are at the corners. If the wolf starts moving towards one side, the two dogs closest to that side can start moving towards the wolf's position. Because the dogs are faster, they can cover the distance quicker.Let me calculate the distances. Suppose the square has side length ( s ). The distance from the center to any side is ( frac{s}{2} ). The wolf needs to cover ( frac{s}{2} ) to escape. The dogs, on the other hand, have to move along the perimeter. The distance from a corner to the midpoint of a side is ( frac{s}{2} ) as well, but the dogs have to move along the edges, so they might have to cover more distance.Wait, no. If the wolf is moving towards a side, the two dogs closest to that side can start moving towards the point where the wolf is heading. The distance each dog needs to cover is ( frac{s}{2} ) along the edge. Since the dogs are moving at ( 1.5v ), their time to cover ( frac{s}{2} ) is ( frac{s}{2 times 1.5v} = frac{s}{3v} ). The wolf's time to cover ( frac{s}{2} ) is ( frac{s}{2v} ). So, ( frac{s}{3v} ) is less than ( frac{s}{2v} ), meaning the dogs can reach the midpoint faster than the wolf.That suggests that the dogs can intercept the wolf before it escapes. But the problem says that one wolf can outrun one dog. So, if only one dog is chasing, the wolf can escape. But with two dogs, they can coordinate and block the wolf.Maybe the key is that the dogs can always position themselves in such a way that the wolf is always between two dogs, preventing it from moving towards any side without being intercepted.Let me think about the angles. If the wolf moves in a certain direction, the dogs can adjust their positions to cut off that direction. Since the dogs are faster, they can always adjust their positions to maintain a barrier.Another thought: the wolf can try to move diagonally, but the dogs can also move diagonally along the edges. Wait, no, the dogs can only move along the sides, not diagonally. So, if the wolf moves towards a corner, the two dogs at that corner can move towards the wolf's position.But the wolf is in the center, so moving towards a corner would require covering ( frac{ssqrt{2}}{2} ) distance, which is longer than moving to the midpoint. The dogs, however, can move along the edges to intercept.Let me calculate the time for the wolf to reach a corner versus the dogs intercepting. The distance for the wolf is ( frac{ssqrt{2}}{2} ), so time is ( frac{ssqrt{2}}{2v} ). The dogs need to cover ( s ) distance along the edge to get to the corner, so time is ( frac{s}{1.5v} ). Comparing these:( frac{ssqrt{2}}{2v} ) vs. ( frac{s}{1.5v} )Simplify:( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} approx 0.707 ) and ( frac{1}{1.5} approx 0.666 )So, ( 0.707 > 0.666 ), meaning the dogs can reach the corner faster than the wolf can reach it from the center.Therefore, if the wolf tries to go towards a corner, the dogs can intercept it first.What if the wolf tries to move towards a side but not directly towards the midpoint? Maybe at an angle. The dogs can adjust their positions accordingly. Since the dogs are faster, they can always move to block the wolf's path.I'm starting to think that no matter which direction the wolf chooses, the dogs can intercept it before it escapes. Since two dogs can outrun the wolf, they can coordinate to always be in a position to block the wolf's escape.But wait, the problem says that one wolf can outrun one dog, but two dogs can outrun the wolf. So, if the wolf can always find a path that only one dog can intercept, it can escape. But with four dogs, maybe the wolf can't find such a path.Alternatively, maybe the dogs can always position themselves in such a way that the wolf is always between two dogs, preventing it from moving towards any side without being intercepted.I think the key is that the dogs can always adjust their positions to maintain a barrier around the wolf. Since they are faster, they can always move to block the wolf's escape route.Therefore, the wolf cannot always escape because the dogs can coordinate to intercept it before it reaches the boundary."},{"question":"Mr. and Mrs. Singh have three children.

The options are A: -e, B: e, C: -1, D: -1/3. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that f'(x) represents the derivative of f with respect to x. So, maybe I should start by finding the derivative of f(x). Let me write down the function again: f(x) = 4x f'(e) + ln x. Alright, to find f'(x), I need to differentiate f(x) with respect to x. Let's do that term by term. The first term is 4x f'(e). Since f'(e) is a constant (because it's the derivative evaluated at a specific point, e), the derivative of 4x f'(e) with respect to x is just 4 f'(e). The second term is ln x. The derivative of ln x with respect to x is 1/x. So putting it all together, f'(x) = 4 f'(e) + 1/x. Wait a second, that seems right. So f'(x) is equal to 4 times f'(e) plus 1 over x. Now, the problem is asking for f(e), so maybe I need to evaluate f'(e) first? Let me think. If I plug x = e into the derivative f'(x), I get f'(e) = 4 f'(e) + 1/e. Hmm, that's an equation involving f'(e). Let me write that down:f'(e) = 4 f'(e) + 1/e.Okay, so I can solve this equation for f'(e). Let's subtract 4 f'(e) from both sides:f'(e) - 4 f'(e) = 1/e.That simplifies to:-3 f'(e) = 1/e.So, dividing both sides by -3:f'(e) = -1/(3e).Alright, so f'(e) is -1 divided by (3e). Now, I need to find f(e). Let's go back to the original function f(x) = 4x f'(e) + ln x. Substituting x = e into this function:f(e) = 4e f'(e) + ln e.I know that ln e is 1, because the natural logarithm of e is 1. So, f(e) = 4e f'(e) + 1.But I already found f'(e) earlier, which is -1/(3e). Let me substitute that in:f(e) = 4e * (-1/(3e)) + 1.Simplify this expression. The e in the numerator and the e in the denominator will cancel out:f(e) = 4 * (-1/3) + 1.Which is:f(e) = -4/3 + 1.Now, 1 can be written as 3/3, so:f(e) = -4/3 + 3/3 = (-4 + 3)/3 = -1/3.So, f(e) is -1/3. Looking back at the options, that's option D.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from f(x) = 4x f'(e) + ln x, I took the derivative correctly, got f'(x) = 4 f'(e) + 1/x. Then, plugging in x = e, I set up the equation f'(e) = 4 f'(e) + 1/e, solved for f'(e) and got -1/(3e). Then, substituted back into f(e) and got -1/3. Yeah, that seems right.I think I'm confident with this answer.

The expressions are p equals b squared over a plus a squared over b, and q is just a plus b. The question is asking about the relationship between p and q, and the options are whether p is greater than q, greater than or equal to q, less than q, or less than or equal to q.Hmm, let me write down the expressions to make it clearer:p = (b²)/a + (a²)/bq = a + bI need to figure out if p is always greater than q, sometimes greater, always less, etc. Since a and b are both positive, I don't have to worry about division by zero or negative numbers messing things up.Maybe I can try to manipulate p to see if I can relate it to q. Let me see. If I look at p, it's like each term is a squared term divided by the other variable. Maybe I can find a way to compare each term of p with the corresponding term in q.Alternatively, I could try subtracting q from p and see if the result is always positive, negative, or depends on the values of a and b.So let's compute p - q:p - q = (b²)/a + (a²)/b - (a + b)Hmm, can I factor this or find a common denominator? Let's see. The common denominator for the first two terms is ab, so let me rewrite p - q:p - q = (b³ + a³)/ab - (a + b)Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator of the first fraction:b³ + a³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)So, substituting back:p - q = [(a + b)(a² - ab + b²)] / ab - (a + b)Factor out (a + b):p - q = (a + b)[(a² - ab + b²)/ab - 1]Simplify the expression inside the brackets:(a² - ab + b²)/ab - 1 = (a² - ab + b² - ab)/ab = (a² - 2ab + b²)/abNotice that a² - 2ab + b² is equal to (a - b)², so:p - q = (a + b)[(a - b)² / ab]Since a and b are positive, both (a + b) and ab are positive. Also, (a - b)² is always non-negative because any real number squared is non-negative. Therefore, the entire expression p - q is non-negative.So, p - q ≥ 0, which means p ≥ q.Now, when does equality hold? That happens when (a - b)² = 0, which implies a = b. So, p equals q only when a equals b.Therefore, the relationship between p and q is that p is always greater than or equal to q, with equality if and only if a equals b.Looking back at the options, that corresponds to option B: p ≥ q.I think that makes sense. Let me double-check by plugging in some numbers. Suppose a = b = 1, then p = 1 + 1 = 2, and q = 1 + 1 = 2. So p = q, which fits the equality case.Another example: let a = 2 and b = 1. Then p = (1²)/2 + (2²)/1 = 1/2 + 4 = 4.5, and q = 2 + 1 = 3. So p = 4.5 > q = 3, which is consistent with p ≥ q.What if a = 3 and b = 2? Then p = (4)/3 + (9)/2 ≈ 1.333 + 4.5 ≈ 5.833, and q = 3 + 2 = 5. So again, p > q.If I try a = 1 and b = 2, p = (4)/1 + (1)/2 = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5, and q = 1 + 2 = 3. So p > q again.It seems consistent that p is always greater than or equal to q, with equality only when a = b. So I feel confident that the correct answer is B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Given the equation of a circle: x^2+y^2=4.(I) Line L passes through point P(1, 2) and intersects circle C at points A and B.

Alternatively, I can write it in the general form ( ax + by + c = 0 ) and use the given conditions to find a and b.But maybe it's easier to consider two cases: one where the line is vertical (slope doesn't exist) and one where it's not vertical (slope exists). Let me try that.Case 1: The line is vertical. Then its equation is ( x = 1 ). Substituting this into the circle equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 4 ), we get ( 1 + y^2 = 4 ), so ( y^2 = 3 ), which gives ( y = sqrt{3} ) and ( y = -sqrt{3} ). So the points A and B are (1, ( sqrt{3} )) and (1, ( -sqrt{3} )). The distance between them is ( 2sqrt{3} ), which matches the given condition. So one possible equation is ( x = 1 ).Case 2: The line is not vertical, so it has a slope. Let's denote the slope as k. Then the equation of the line can be written as ( y - 2 = k(x - 1) ), which simplifies to ( y = kx - k + 2 ). To find where this line intersects the circle, I can substitute ( y ) from the line equation into the circle equation.Substituting ( y = kx - k + 2 ) into ( x^2 + y^2 = 4 ):( x^2 + (kx - k + 2)^2 = 4 )Expanding the square:( x^2 + (k^2x^2 - 2k(k - 2)x + (k - 2)^2) = 4 )Wait, let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes.First, expand ( (kx - k + 2)^2 ):Let me write it as ( [k(x - 1) + 2]^2 ). So expanding this:( [k(x - 1) + 2]^2 = k^2(x - 1)^2 + 4k(x - 1) + 4 )So substituting back into the circle equation:( x^2 + k^2(x - 1)^2 + 4k(x - 1) + 4 = 4 )Simplify the equation:( x^2 + k^2(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 4k(x - 1) + 4 = 4 )Expanding further:( x^2 + k^2x^2 - 2k^2x + k^2 + 4kx - 4k + 4 = 4 )Combine like terms:The ( x^2 ) terms: ( (1 + k^2)x^2 )The ( x ) terms: ( (-2k^2 + 4k)x )Constant terms: ( k^2 - 4k + 4 )So the equation becomes:( (1 + k^2)x^2 + (-2k^2 + 4k)x + (k^2 - 4k + 4) = 4 )Subtract 4 from both sides:( (1 + k^2)x^2 + (-2k^2 + 4k)x + (k^2 - 4k) = 0 )This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's denote it as ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where:( a = 1 + k^2 )( b = -2k^2 + 4k )( c = k^2 - 4k )The solutions to this quadratic will give the x-coordinates of points A and B. The distance between A and B is given as ( 2sqrt{3} ). To find the distance between two points on a line, we can use the distance formula. But since the line intersects the circle, the distance between A and B can also be related to the length of the chord.I remember that the length of a chord in a circle is given by ( 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} ), where r is the radius and d is the distance from the center to the chord.In this case, the radius r is 2, since the circle equation is ( x^2 + y^2 = 4 ). So, the length of chord AB is ( 2sqrt{3} ). Therefore:( 2sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} )Divide both sides by 2:( sqrt{3} = sqrt{4 - d^2} )Square both sides:( 3 = 4 - d^2 )So, ( d^2 = 1 ), which means ( d = 1 ).Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle (which is the origin (0,0)) to the line L is 1.The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ( ax + by + c = 0 ) is ( frac{|ax0 + by0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} ).In our case, the line L is ( y = kx - k + 2 ), which can be rewritten as ( kx - y - k + 2 = 0 ). So, a = k, b = -1, c = -k + 2.The distance from (0,0) to this line is:( frac{|k*0 + (-1)*0 + (-k + 2)|}{sqrt{k^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{| -k + 2 |}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} )We know this distance is equal to 1, so:( frac{| -k + 2 |}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1 )Multiply both sides by the denominator:( | -k + 2 | = sqrt{k^2 + 1} )Square both sides to eliminate the absolute value and square root:( (-k + 2)^2 = k^2 + 1 )Expand the left side:( k^2 - 4k + 4 = k^2 + 1 )Subtract ( k^2 ) from both sides:( -4k + 4 = 1 )Subtract 4 from both sides:( -4k = -3 )Divide both sides by -4:( k = frac{3}{4} )So, the slope k is ( frac{3}{4} ). Therefore, the equation of line L is:( y - 2 = frac{3}{4}(x - 1) )Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:( 4(y - 2) = 3(x - 1) )Expand:( 4y - 8 = 3x - 3 )Bring all terms to one side:( -3x + 4y - 5 = 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficients positive:( 3x - 4y + 5 = 0 )So, the equation of line L is ( 3x - 4y + 5 = 0 ).Therefore, there are two possible lines: one vertical line ( x = 1 ) and one with slope ( frac{3}{4} ) given by ( 3x - 4y + 5 = 0 ).Moving on to part (II). We have a line m parallel to the X-axis passing through a moving point M on the circle C. Let’s denote M as (s, t). Since line m is parallel to the X-axis, its equation is ( y = t ). The intersection of this line with the Y-axis is point N, which occurs where x = 0. So, substituting x = 0 into the line equation, we get y = t. Therefore, point N is (0, t).We are given that vector ( overrightarrow{OQ} = overrightarrow{OM} + overrightarrow{ON} ), where O is the origin. Let's express these vectors in terms of coordinates.Point M is (s, t), so vector ( overrightarrow{OM} ) is (s, t).Point N is (0, t), so vector ( overrightarrow{ON} ) is (0, t).Adding these vectors:( overrightarrow{OQ} = (s, t) + (0, t) = (s, 2t) )Therefore, point Q has coordinates (s, 2t). Let’s denote Q as (x, y). So:( x = s )( y = 2t )We need to find the equation of the trajectory of point Q as M moves on the circle C. Since M is on the circle, it satisfies the equation ( s^2 + t^2 = 4 ).From the coordinates of Q, we have:( s = x )( t = frac{y}{2} )Substitute these into the circle equation:( x^2 + left( frac{y}{2} right)^2 = 4 )Simplify:( x^2 + frac{y^2}{4} = 4 )To write this in standard form, divide both sides by 4:( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{16} = 1 )This is the equation of an ellipse with semi-major axis 4 along the y-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the x-axis.So, the trajectory of point Q is given by ( frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{16} = 1 ).**Final Answer**(I) The equations of line ( L ) are ( boxed{x = 1} ) and ( boxed{3x - 4y + 5 = 0} ).(II) The equation of the trajectory of point ( Q ) is ( boxed{dfrac{x^2}{4} + dfrac{y^2}{16} = 1} )."},{"question":"Given the line ( l ) passing through the point ( (0,1) ) intersects the curve ( C ), ( y = x + frac{1}{x} ) (for ( x > 0 )), at two distinct points ( M ) and ( N ). Find the locus of the intersection point of the tangents to the curve ( C ) at points ( M ) and ( N ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where a line passes through the point (0,1) and intersects the curve ( y = x + frac{1}{x} ) at two distinct points M and N. I need to find the locus of the intersection point of the tangents to the curve at M and N. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the curve ( y = x + frac{1}{x} ) for ( x > 0 ). It's a hyperbola, right? As x approaches 0 from the right, ( frac{1}{x} ) goes to infinity, so the curve goes up. As x increases, the ( frac{1}{x} ) term becomes negligible, so the curve behaves like the line y = x. So, it's a curve that starts high near x=0 and then gradually approaches the line y = x as x increases.Now, the line passes through (0,1). Let me denote this line as ( l ). Since it passes through (0,1), its equation can be written as ( y = kx + 1 ), where k is the slope. So, depending on the value of k, the line will intersect the curve ( y = x + frac{1}{x} ) at two points M and N.To find these intersection points, I need to solve the system of equations:[begin{cases}y = x + frac{1}{x} y = kx + 1end{cases}]Setting them equal to each other:[x + frac{1}{x} = kx + 1]Let me rearrange this equation:[x + frac{1}{x} - kx - 1 = 0]Combine like terms:[(1 - k)x + frac{1}{x} - 1 = 0]Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:[(1 - k)x^2 + x - 1 = 0]Okay, so that's a quadratic equation in terms of x:[(1 - k)x^2 + x - 1 = 0]Since the line intersects the curve at two distinct points, this quadratic must have two distinct real roots. Therefore, the discriminant must be positive.The discriminant ( D ) of a quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is ( D = b^2 - 4ac ). Let me compute that:Here, ( a = 1 - k ), ( b = 1 ), ( c = -1 ).So,[D = 1^2 - 4(1 - k)(-1) = 1 - 4(-1 + k) = 1 + 4 - 4k = 5 - 4k]For two distinct real roots, ( D > 0 ):[5 - 4k > 0 implies 4k < 5 implies k < frac{5}{4}]But also, since ( x > 0 ), the roots must be positive. Let me think about that. For a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the roots are positive if:1. The sum of the roots is positive: ( -frac{b}{a} > 0 )2. The product of the roots is positive: ( frac{c}{a} > 0 )So, let's compute the sum and product of the roots.Sum of roots:[x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} = -frac{1}{1 - k}]Product of roots:[x_1 x_2 = frac{c}{a} = frac{-1}{1 - k}]We need both the sum and product to be positive.So,1. ( -frac{1}{1 - k} > 0 implies frac{1}{1 - k} < 0 implies 1 - k < 0 implies k > 1 )2. ( frac{-1}{1 - k} > 0 implies frac{-1}{1 - k} > 0 implies 1 - k < 0 implies k > 1 )So, both conditions lead to ( k > 1 ). But earlier, we had ( k < frac{5}{4} ). So, combining these, ( 1 < k < frac{5}{4} ).Wait, but the original curve is defined for ( x > 0 ), so we need to ensure that both roots are positive. So, k must be between 1 and 5/4.But wait, let me check if k can be equal to 1. If k=1, the quadratic becomes ( 0x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ), which is linear: x - 1 = 0, so x=1. So, only one intersection point. Therefore, k cannot be 1 because we need two distinct points. So, k must be strictly greater than 1 and less than 5/4.So, ( 1 < k < frac{5}{4} ).Alright, so now, we have two points M and N on the curve, with x-coordinates ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ), which are the roots of the quadratic equation.Now, the next part is to find the tangents to the curve at M and N, and then find their intersection point P. Then, we need to find the locus of P as the line l varies (i.e., as k varies between 1 and 5/4).So, let's find the equations of the tangents at M and N.First, let me find the derivative of the curve ( y = x + frac{1}{x} ) to get the slope of the tangent at any point x.[frac{dy}{dx} = 1 - frac{1}{x^2}]So, at point M with x-coordinate ( x_1 ), the slope of the tangent is ( m_1 = 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} ).Similarly, at point N with x-coordinate ( x_2 ), the slope of the tangent is ( m_2 = 1 - frac{1}{x_2^2} ).Now, let's write the equations of these tangents.For tangent at M:[y - y_1 = m_1 (x - x_1)]Where ( y_1 = x_1 + frac{1}{x_1} ).Substituting ( m_1 ):[y - left( x_1 + frac{1}{x_1} right) = left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)(x - x_1)]Let me simplify this equation.First, expand the right-hand side:[left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x - left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x_1]Simplify each term:[left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x = x - frac{x}{x_1^2}][left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x_1 = x_1 - frac{x_1}{x_1^2} = x_1 - frac{1}{x_1}]So, putting it back:[y - x_1 - frac{1}{x_1} = x - frac{x}{x_1^2} - x_1 + frac{1}{x_1}]Simplify the left-hand side and right-hand side:Left-hand side: ( y - x_1 - frac{1}{x_1} )Right-hand side: ( x - frac{x}{x_1^2} - x_1 + frac{1}{x_1} )Bring all terms to one side:[y = x - frac{x}{x_1^2} - x_1 + frac{1}{x_1} + x_1 + frac{1}{x_1}]Simplify:The ( -x_1 ) and ( +x_1 ) cancel out.So,[y = x - frac{x}{x_1^2} + frac{2}{x_1}]Factor x:[y = x left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right) + frac{2}{x_1}]Similarly, the tangent at N will be:[y = x left( 1 - frac{1}{x_2^2} right) + frac{2}{x_2}]So, now we have two equations of the tangents:1. ( y = left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x + frac{2}{x_1} )2. ( y = left( 1 - frac{1}{x_2^2} right)x + frac{2}{x_2} )We need to find their intersection point P, which is ( (x_P, y_P) ).To find the intersection, set the two equations equal:[left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x + frac{2}{x_1} = left( 1 - frac{1}{x_2^2} right)x + frac{2}{x_2}]Let me rearrange this equation:[left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} - 1 + frac{1}{x_2^2} right)x + frac{2}{x_1} - frac{2}{x_2} = 0]Simplify the coefficients:[left( -frac{1}{x_1^2} + frac{1}{x_2^2} right)x + frac{2}{x_1} - frac{2}{x_2} = 0]Factor out the common terms:[left( frac{1}{x_2^2} - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x + 2left( frac{1}{x_1} - frac{1}{x_2} right) = 0]Notice that ( frac{1}{x_2^2} - frac{1}{x_1^2} = left( frac{1}{x_2} - frac{1}{x_1} right)left( frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_1} right) ). Similarly, ( frac{1}{x_1} - frac{1}{x_2} = -left( frac{1}{x_2} - frac{1}{x_1} right) ).Let me denote ( a = frac{1}{x_1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{x_2} ). Then, the equation becomes:[(b^2 - a^2)x + 2(a - b) = 0]Factor ( b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a) ), so:[(b - a)(b + a)x + 2(a - b) = 0]Factor out ( (b - a) ):[(b - a)left( (b + a)x - 2 right) = 0]Since ( x_1 neq x_2 ), ( a neq b ), so ( b - a neq 0 ). Therefore, the equation reduces to:[(b + a)x - 2 = 0 implies x = frac{2}{a + b}]But ( a = frac{1}{x_1} ) and ( b = frac{1}{x_2} ), so:[x_P = frac{2}{frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2}} = frac{2x_1x_2}{x_1 + x_2}]Okay, so that's the x-coordinate of point P. Now, let's find the y-coordinate.We can plug ( x_P ) back into one of the tangent equations. Let me use the first one:[y_P = left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)x_P + frac{2}{x_1}]Substitute ( x_P = frac{2x_1x_2}{x_1 + x_2} ):[y_P = left( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} right)left( frac{2x_1x_2}{x_1 + x_2} right) + frac{2}{x_1}]Let me simplify this step by step.First, compute ( 1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} ):[1 - frac{1}{x_1^2} = frac{x_1^2 - 1}{x_1^2}]So,[y_P = frac{x_1^2 - 1}{x_1^2} cdot frac{2x_1x_2}{x_1 + x_2} + frac{2}{x_1}]Simplify the first term:Multiply numerator:[(x_1^2 - 1) cdot 2x_1x_2 = 2x_1x_2(x_1^2 - 1)]Denominator:[x_1^2(x_1 + x_2)]So, the first term becomes:[frac{2x_1x_2(x_1^2 - 1)}{x_1^2(x_1 + x_2)} = frac{2x_2(x_1^2 - 1)}{x_1(x_1 + x_2)}]So, now, ( y_P ) is:[y_P = frac{2x_2(x_1^2 - 1)}{x_1(x_1 + x_2)} + frac{2}{x_1}]Let me combine these two terms. To do that, I'll get a common denominator, which is ( x_1(x_1 + x_2) ).First term is already over that denominator. The second term is ( frac{2}{x_1} = frac{2(x_1 + x_2)}{x_1(x_1 + x_2)} ).So,[y_P = frac{2x_2(x_1^2 - 1) + 2(x_1 + x_2)}{x_1(x_1 + x_2)}]Let me expand the numerator:[2x_2x_1^2 - 2x_2 + 2x_1 + 2x_2 = 2x_2x_1^2 + 2x_1]Simplify:The -2x_2 and +2x_2 cancel out, so we have:[2x_2x_1^2 + 2x_1]Factor out 2x_1:[2x_1(x_2x_1 + 1)]So, numerator is ( 2x_1(x_1x_2 + 1) ), denominator is ( x_1(x_1 + x_2) ).Cancel out ( x_1 ):[y_P = frac{2(x_1x_2 + 1)}{x_1 + x_2}]Alright, so now we have expressions for ( x_P ) and ( y_P ) in terms of ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).But we need to express this in terms of k, or find a relation that eliminates ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).Recall that ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are roots of the quadratic equation ( (1 - k)x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ).From Vieta's formulas, we know:[x_1 + x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1}]Wait, hold on. Let me double-check.Quadratic equation is ( (1 - k)x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ). So, in standard form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), we have:( a = 1 - k ), ( b = 1 ), ( c = -1 ).So, sum of roots:[x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} = -frac{1}{1 - k} = frac{1}{k - 1}]Product of roots:[x_1x_2 = frac{c}{a} = frac{-1}{1 - k} = frac{1}{k - 1}]Wait, that's interesting. So, both the sum and the product of roots are equal to ( frac{1}{k - 1} ).So,[x_1 + x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1}][x_1x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1}]So, both sum and product are equal. That's a useful relation.So, let me note that ( x_1 + x_2 = x_1x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1} ).So, going back to ( x_P ):[x_P = frac{2x_1x_2}{x_1 + x_2} = frac{2 cdot frac{1}{k - 1}}{frac{1}{k - 1}} = 2]Wait, that's interesting. So, ( x_P = 2 ) regardless of k? That's a constant.So, the x-coordinate of point P is always 2. So, the locus lies on the vertical line x=2.Now, let's find ( y_P ):[y_P = frac{2(x_1x_2 + 1)}{x_1 + x_2}]But since ( x_1x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1} ) and ( x_1 + x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1} ), substitute:[y_P = frac{2left( frac{1}{k - 1} + 1 right)}{frac{1}{k - 1}} = 2left( frac{frac{1}{k - 1} + 1}{frac{1}{k - 1}} right) = 2left( 1 + (k - 1) right) = 2k]Wait, hold on. Let me compute that step by step.First, compute the numerator inside the brackets:[frac{1}{k - 1} + 1 = frac{1 + (k - 1)}{k - 1} = frac{k}{k - 1}]So,[y_P = 2 cdot frac{frac{k}{k - 1}}{frac{1}{k - 1}} = 2 cdot frac{k}{k - 1} cdot (k - 1) = 2k]Yes, that's correct. So, ( y_P = 2k ).But earlier, we found that ( k ) is between 1 and 5/4. So, ( 1 < k < frac{5}{4} ).Therefore, ( y_P = 2k ) implies that ( y_P ) is between ( 2 times 1 = 2 ) and ( 2 times frac{5}{4} = frac{5}{2} ).So, ( 2 < y_P < frac{5}{2} ).Therefore, the locus of point P is the vertical line segment from (2, 2) to (2, 5/2), excluding the endpoints because k is strictly between 1 and 5/4.Wait, but let me think again. When k approaches 1 from above, y_P approaches 2, and when k approaches 5/4 from below, y_P approaches 5/2. So, the locus is the set of all points (2, y) where y is between 2 and 5/2, not including the endpoints.But let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake.First, when I found ( y_P = 2k ), and since ( 1 < k < frac{5}{4} ), then ( 2 < y_P < frac{5}{2} ). So, yes, that seems correct.But let me also verify the expression for ( y_P ). I had:[y_P = frac{2(x_1x_2 + 1)}{x_1 + x_2}]Given that ( x_1x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1} ) and ( x_1 + x_2 = frac{1}{k - 1} ), so:[y_P = frac{2left( frac{1}{k - 1} + 1 right)}{frac{1}{k - 1}} = 2left( 1 + (k - 1) right) = 2k]Yes, that's correct.So, putting it all together, the locus is the set of points (2, y) where y ranges from 2 to 5/2, not including the endpoints. So, it's the vertical line segment from (2, 2) to (2, 5/2), excluding the endpoints.But wait, let me think about whether the endpoints are included or not. Since k approaches 1 and 5/4 but doesn't reach them, the points (2, 2) and (2, 5/2) are not included in the locus.Therefore, the locus is the open line segment between (2, 2) and (2, 5/2).So, in conclusion, the locus of the intersection point P is the vertical line segment from (2, 2) to (2, 5/2), excluding the endpoints.**Final Answer**The locus of the intersection point is the vertical line segment from ((2, 2)) to (left(2, frac{5}{2}right)), excluding the endpoints. Thus, the solution is:[boxed{(2, 2) text{ to } left(2, frac{5}{2}right) text{ (exclusive)}}]"},{"question":"What is the largest integer that is a divisor of [(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)(n+11)(n+13)]for all positive even integers n?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest integer that is a divisor of the product ((n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)(n+11)(n+13)) for all positive even integers (n). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, since (n) is a positive even integer, that means (n) can be 2, 4, 6, and so on. So, if I substitute (n = 2), the product becomes (3 times 5 times 7 times 9 times 11 times 13 times 15). If I take (n = 4), it becomes (5 times 7 times 9 times 11 times 13 times 15 times 17), and so on. It seems like each time, I'm getting seven consecutive odd numbers starting from (n+1).So, the product is always seven consecutive odd numbers. Now, I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all such products for every even (n). That means I need to find a number that divides every such product, no matter what even (n) I choose.Let me think about divisibility. For a number to divide all these products, it must be a common factor in every possible product of seven consecutive odd numbers. So, I need to find the common factors that are present in every such product.Let me consider prime factors because primes are the building blocks of numbers. If I can find primes that always divide the product, then their product will be a divisor of the original product.Starting with the smallest primes:1. **Prime 2**: Since all the terms in the product are odd (because (n) is even, so (n + text{odd}) is odd), none of them are divisible by 2. So, 2 cannot be a common divisor.2. **Prime 3**: Now, in any set of consecutive numbers, every third number is divisible by 3. But here, we're dealing with seven consecutive odd numbers. Let me check: in seven consecutive odd numbers, how many are divisible by 3?   Since odd numbers are spaced by 2, the difference between consecutive terms is 2. So, the sequence modulo 3 would be: (n+1, n+3, n+5, n+7, n+9, n+11, n+13). Let me compute each term modulo 3:   - (n+1 mod 3)   - (n+3 mod 3 = (n mod 3) + 0)   - (n+5 mod 3 = (n mod 3) + 2)   - (n+7 mod 3 = (n mod 3) + 1)   - (n+9 mod 3 = (n mod 3) + 0)   - (n+11 mod 3 = (n mod 3) + 2)   - (n+13 mod 3 = (n mod 3) + 1)   Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to note that in any seven consecutive odd numbers, there must be at least one multiple of 3 because every third odd number is a multiple of 3. Since seven is more than three, we're guaranteed at least two multiples of 3? Wait, no. Let me think again.   Actually, in seven consecutive odd numbers, how many are divisible by 3? Let's take an example. If (n = 2), the numbers are 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Here, 3, 9, and 15 are multiples of 3. So, three multiples. If (n = 4), the numbers are 5,7,9,11,13,15,17. Here, 9 and 15 are multiples of 3. So, two multiples. If (n = 6), the numbers are 7,9,11,13,15,17,19. Again, 9 and 15 are multiples. So, it seems that depending on where you start, you can have two or three multiples of 3 in seven consecutive odd numbers.   But regardless, in every case, there is at least one multiple of 3. So, 3 is a common divisor.3. **Prime 5**: Similarly, let's check for 5. In seven consecutive odd numbers, how many are divisible by 5? Since every fifth odd number is a multiple of 5, in seven consecutive odds, there must be at least one multiple of 5. For example, if (n = 2), the numbers include 5 and 15, so two multiples. If (n = 4), the numbers include 5, 15, so again two multiples. If (n = 6), the numbers include 15, so one multiple. So, at least one multiple of 5 in every case. Therefore, 5 is a common divisor.4. **Prime 7**: Next, checking for 7. Every seventh odd number is a multiple of 7. In seven consecutive odd numbers, there will be exactly one multiple of 7 because the spacing is 2, so the next multiple of 7 would be 14 apart, which is beyond seven consecutive odds. Wait, let me test with examples.   If (n = 2), the numbers are 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Here, 7 is a multiple. If (n = 4), the numbers are 5,7,9,11,13,15,17. Again, 7 is present. If (n = 6), the numbers are 7,9,11,13,15,17,19. 7 is present. If (n = 8), the numbers are 9,11,13,15,17,19,21. 21 is a multiple of 7. So, in every case, there is exactly one multiple of 7. Therefore, 7 is a common divisor.5. **Prime 11**: Let's check 11. Every eleventh odd number is a multiple of 11. In seven consecutive odds, it's possible that none are multiples of 11. For example, if (n = 2), the numbers are 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Here, 11 is present. If (n = 4), the numbers are 5,7,9,11,13,15,17. 11 is present. If (n = 6), the numbers are 7,9,11,13,15,17,19. 11 is present. If (n = 8), the numbers are 9,11,13,15,17,19,21. 11 is present. If (n = 10), the numbers are 11,13,15,17,19,21,23. 11 is present. If (n = 12), the numbers are 13,15,17,19,21,23,25. Here, none of these are multiples of 11. So, in this case, the product does not include a multiple of 11. Therefore, 11 is not a common divisor.6. **Prime 13**: Similarly, checking 13. If (n = 2), 13 is present. If (n = 4), 13 is present. If (n = 6), 13 is present. If (n = 8), 13 is present. If (n = 10), 13 is present. If (n = 12), 13 is present. If (n = 14), the numbers are 15,17,19,21,23,25,27. None of these are multiples of 13. So, 13 is not a common divisor.So, from the primes, we've established that 3, 5, and 7 are common divisors, but 11 and 13 are not. What about higher powers of these primes?- **3^2 = 9**: Let's see if 9 divides all such products. For example, when (n = 2), the product includes 9 and 15, so 9 divides the product. When (n = 4), the product includes 9 and 15, so 9 divides the product. When (n = 6), the product includes 9 and 15, so 9 divides the product. When (n = 8), the product includes 9 and 21, so 9 divides the product. When (n = 10), the product includes 11 and 13, but does it include 9? Wait, (n = 10) gives 11,13,15,17,19,21,23. 15 and 21 are multiples of 3, but 15 is 3*5 and 21 is 3*7. Neither is 9. So, 9 does not divide the product when (n = 10). Therefore, 9 is not a common divisor.- **5^2 = 25**: Let's check if 25 divides all products. When (n = 2), the product includes 5 and 15, so 25 divides the product because 15 is 3*5, but 25 is 5^2. Wait, 15 is only one 5, so 25 doesn't divide 15. Wait, actually, 25 divides the product only if there are at least two multiples of 5 in the seven consecutive odds. Let's see: For (n = 2), we have 5 and 15, so two multiples of 5, so 25 divides the product. For (n = 4), we have 5 and 15, so again two multiples. For (n = 6), we have 15, which is one multiple. So, only one multiple of 5. Therefore, 25 does not divide the product when (n = 6). Hence, 25 is not a common divisor.- **7^2 = 49**: Similarly, checking if 49 divides all products. When (n = 2), the product includes 7 and 49? Wait, (n = 2) gives 3,5,7,9,11,13,15. Only 7 is a multiple of 7, so 49 does not divide the product. Therefore, 49 is not a common divisor.So, higher powers of 3, 5, and 7 are not common divisors. Therefore, the common prime factors are 3, 5, and 7, each to the first power.Now, let's consider if there are any other primes that might be common divisors. We've already checked 11 and 13, which are not. What about primes larger than 13? For example, 17, 19, etc. It's clear that as we go higher, the likelihood of these primes being present in every product diminishes because the spacing between multiples of these primes is larger than seven. So, it's unlikely that any prime larger than 7 is a common divisor.Therefore, the greatest common divisor must be the product of 3, 5, and 7, which is 105.To confirm, let's test with specific values of (n):- (n = 2): Product is 3*5*7*9*11*13*15. Divided by 105, we get 3*5*7*9*11*13*15 / (3*5*7) = 9*11*13*15, which is an integer.- (n = 4): Product is 5*7*9*11*13*15*17. Divided by 105, we get 5*7*9*11*13*15*17 / (3*5*7) = 9*11*13*15*17, which is an integer.- (n = 6): Product is 7*9*11*13*15*17*19. Divided by 105, we get 7*9*11*13*15*17*19 / (3*5*7) = 9*11*13*15*17*19 / 5. Wait, 15 is 3*5, so 15/5 = 3. Therefore, it becomes 9*11*13*3*17*19, which is still an integer.So, in all these cases, 105 divides the product. Also, as we saw earlier, higher numbers like 210 (which is 2*105) cannot divide because 2 is not a common divisor. Similarly, 315 (which is 3*105) cannot divide because we've already established that 9 is not a common divisor.Therefore, after considering all these factors, I conclude that the largest integer that is a divisor of the given product for all positive even integers (n) is 105."},{"question":"The zero of the function y=(x+1)^2 is (   )A: 0B: -1C: (0,0)D: (-1,0)","answer":"First, I need to find the zero of the function ( y = (x + 1)^2 ).

I know that taking the bus both ways takes 30 minutes, so one way by bus is half of that, which is 15 minutes.Next, I look at the total time when the student walks to school and takes the bus back, which is 90 minutes. Since the bus ride back takes 15 minutes, the time spent walking to school is 90 minutes minus 15 minutes, resulting in 75 minutes.Finally, to find the total time if the student walks both ways, I multiply the one-way walking time by two.

They make statements about how much money they would have if the others gave them half of their money. My goal is to figure out how much money B has. The options given are A: 28, B: 32, C: 56, D: 70.First, I need to understand what each person is saying. Let's break it down:1. **A says to B and C:** \\"Each of you give me half of the money you hold, and then I will have 90.\\" So, if B and C each give A half of their money, A's total will be 90.2. **B says to A and C:** \\"Each of you give me half of the money you hold, and then I will have 70.\\" Similarly, if A and C each give B half of their money, B's total will be 70.3. **C says to A and B:** \\"Each of you give me half of the money you hold, and then I will have 56.\\" So, if A and B each give C half of their money, C's total will be 56.Okay, so we have three statements here, each involving the redistribution of half of the money from two people to the third. It sounds like a system of equations problem where I can set up variables for each person's money and then translate these statements into equations.Let me assign variables:- Let ( x ) be the amount of money A has.- Let ( y ) be the amount of money B has.- Let ( z ) be the amount of money C has.Now, let's translate each statement into an equation.**First statement (A's statement):** If B and C each give A half of their money, A will have 90.So, B gives A ( frac{y}{2} ), and C gives A ( frac{z}{2} ). Therefore, A's new amount is:( x + frac{y}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 90 )That's our first equation.**Second statement (B's statement):** If A and C each give B half of their money, B will have 70.Similarly, A gives B ( frac{x}{2} ), and C gives B ( frac{z}{2} ). So, B's new amount is:( y + frac{x}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 70 )That's our second equation.**Third statement (C's statement):** If A and B each give C half of their money, C will have 56.A gives C ( frac{x}{2} ), and B gives C ( frac{y}{2} ). So, C's new amount is:( z + frac{x}{2} + frac{y}{2} = 56 )That's our third equation.So now, we have a system of three equations:1. ( x + frac{y}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 90 )  2. ( y + frac{x}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 70 )  3. ( z + frac{x}{2} + frac{y}{2} = 56 )Now, I need to solve this system of equations to find the values of ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ), specifically ( y ) since we're asked about B's money.Let me write the equations again for clarity:1. ( x + frac{y}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 90 )  2. ( y + frac{x}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 70 )  3. ( z + frac{x}{2} + frac{y}{2} = 56 )Hmm, these equations all have similar structures. Maybe I can simplify them by multiplying each equation by 2 to eliminate the fractions. Let's try that.Multiplying equation 1 by 2:( 2x + y + z = 180 )  Equation 1a: ( 2x + y + z = 180 )Multiplying equation 2 by 2:( 2y + x + z = 140 )  Equation 2a: ( x + 2y + z = 140 )Multiplying equation 3 by 2:( 2z + x + y = 112 )  Equation 3a: ( x + y + 2z = 112 )Now, the system looks like:1. ( 2x + y + z = 180 )  2. ( x + 2y + z = 140 )  3. ( x + y + 2z = 112 )This seems more manageable. Now, I can use methods like substitution or elimination to solve for ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ).Let me consider subtracting equations to eliminate variables.First, let's subtract equation 2a from equation 1a:Equation 1a: ( 2x + y + z = 180 )  Equation 2a: ( x + 2y + z = 140 )  Subtracting 2a from 1a:( (2x - x) + (y - 2y) + (z - z) = 180 - 140 )  Simplifying:( x - y = 40 )  So, equation 4: ( x = y + 40 )Okay, that's useful. Now, let's subtract equation 3a from equation 2a:Equation 2a: ( x + 2y + z = 140 )  Equation 3a: ( x + y + 2z = 112 )  Subtracting 3a from 2a:( (x - x) + (2y - y) + (z - 2z) = 140 - 112 )  Simplifying:( y - z = 28 )  So, equation 5: ( y = z + 28 )Great, now we have expressions for ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of ( y ) and ( z ). Let's see if we can substitute these into one of the equations to find the values.From equation 4: ( x = y + 40 )  From equation 5: ( y = z + 28 )So, ( x = (z + 28) + 40 = z + 68 )Now, we can express all variables in terms of ( z ):- ( x = z + 68 )- ( y = z + 28 )- ( z = z )Now, let's substitute these into equation 3a: ( x + y + 2z = 112 )Substituting:( (z + 68) + (z + 28) + 2z = 112 )Simplify:( z + 68 + z + 28 + 2z = 112 )  Combine like terms:( (z + z + 2z) + (68 + 28) = 112 )  ( 4z + 96 = 112 )Subtract 96 from both sides:( 4z = 16 )Divide both sides by 4:( z = 4 )Okay, so C has 4 units of money. Now, let's find ( y ) using equation 5: ( y = z + 28 )Substitute ( z = 4 ):( y = 4 + 28 = 32 )So, B has 32 units of money. That's one of the options, option B: 32.But just to be thorough, let's find ( x ) as well, using equation 4: ( x = y + 40 )Substitute ( y = 32 ):( x = 32 + 40 = 72 )So, A has 72 units of money.Let me double-check these values in the original equations to ensure they satisfy all three statements.**First statement (A's statement):**  A has 72, B has 32, C has 4.  B gives A half of 32, which is 16.  C gives A half of 4, which is 2.  So, A's total becomes 72 + 16 + 2 = 90.  That's correct.**Second statement (B's statement):**  A gives B half of 72, which is 36.  C gives B half of 4, which is 2.  So, B's total becomes 32 + 36 + 2 = 70.  That's correct.**Third statement (C's statement):**  A gives C half of 72, which is 36.  B gives C half of 32, which is 16.  So, C's total becomes 4 + 36 + 16 = 56.  That's also correct.Everything checks out. So, the amount of money B has is 32, which corresponds to option B.I think I've got this right. I started by setting up the equations based on the problem statements, simplified them by eliminating fractions, expressed variables in terms of others, substituted back into the equations, and solved step by step. Then, I double-checked the solution in the original problem to ensure it works.

How many digits are there before the decimal point in Vasya's number?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a teacher wrote a positive number x on the board, and three students—Kolya, Petya, and Vasya—were asked to raise this number to the 3rd, 4th, and 12th powers, respectively. The problem states that Kolya's number had at least 9 digits before the decimal point, and Petya's number had no more than 11 digits before the decimal point. I need to figure out how many digits are there before the decimal point in Vasya's number.Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, I know that the number of digits in a number can be determined using logarithms. Specifically, the number of digits d in a number N is given by d = floor(log₁₀(N)) + 1. So, if I can find the range of x, I can then figure out the number of digits in x¹².Starting with Kolya's result: x³ has at least 9 digits. That means x³ ≥ 10⁸ because 10⁸ is the smallest 9-digit number (100,000,000). So, I can write that as:x³ ≥ 10⁸To solve for x, I can take the cube root of both sides:x ≥ (10⁸)^(1/3)Calculating that, 10⁸ is 100,000,000, and the cube root of 100,000,000 is 10^(8/3). Let me compute 8 divided by 3, which is approximately 2.6667. So, x is at least 10^2.6667.Now, moving on to Petya's result: x⁴ has no more than 11 digits. That means x⁴ < 10¹¹ because 10¹¹ is the smallest 12-digit number (100,000,000,000). So, I can write that as:x⁴ < 10¹¹To solve for x, I take the fourth root of both sides:x < (10¹¹)^(1/4)Calculating that, 10¹¹ is 100,000,000,000, and the fourth root of that is 10^(11/4). Let me compute 11 divided by 4, which is 2.75. So, x is less than 10^2.75.Putting these two inequalities together, I have:10^2.6667 ≤ x < 10^2.75Now, I need to find the number of digits in Vasya's number, which is x¹². To do this, I'll raise the lower and upper bounds of x to the 12th power.First, let's compute the lower bound:(10^2.6667)^12 = 10^(2.6667 * 12) = 10^32Next, the upper bound:(10^2.75)^12 = 10^(2.75 * 12) = 10^33So, x¹² is between 10^32 and 10^33. Now, 10^32 is a 1 followed by 32 zeros, which is a 33-digit number. Similarly, 10^33 is a 1 followed by 33 zeros, which is a 34-digit number. However, since x¹² is less than 10^33, it must have fewer than 34 digits. But since it's at least 10^32, it has at least 33 digits.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If x is less than 10^2.75, then x¹² is less than 10^33, which means it's less than a 34-digit number. But since x is at least 10^2.6667, x¹² is at least 10^32, which is a 33-digit number. So, x¹² is between 10^32 and 10^33, meaning it has exactly 33 digits before the decimal point.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about it another way. If x is between 10^2.6667 and 10^2.75, then log₁₀(x) is between 2.6667 and 2.75. Then, log₁₀(x¹²) = 12 * log₁₀(x), which would be between 12 * 2.6667 = 32 and 12 * 2.75 = 33. So, log₁₀(x¹²) is between 32 and 33, meaning x¹² is between 10^32 and 10^33, confirming that it has 33 digits.Therefore, Vasya's number has 33 digits before the decimal point."},{"question":"Given that ( n ) is a positive integer less than 100, and ( 5n^2 + 3n - 5 ) is a multiple of 15, what is the sum of all such positive integers ( n )?(A) 285  (B) 350  (C) 540  (D) 635","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find all positive integers ( n ) less than 100 such that ( 5n^2 + 3n - 5 ) is a multiple of 15. Then, I have to sum all those ( n ) values and choose the correct answer from the options given. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I know that if a number is a multiple of 15, it must be divisible by both 3 and 5. So, I can approach this problem by checking the divisibility conditions separately for 3 and 5, and then combine the results.Let me start with the divisibility by 5 because the expression has a 5 coefficient, which might simplify things.Looking at ( 5n^2 + 3n - 5 ), I can factor out a 5 from the first and last terms: ( 5(n^2 - 1) + 3n ). So, the expression becomes ( 5(n^2 - 1) + 3n ). For this to be divisible by 5, the entire expression must be congruent to 0 modulo 5. So, ( 5(n^2 - 1) + 3n equiv 0 mod 5 ). Since ( 5(n^2 - 1) ) is obviously divisible by 5, the remaining part is ( 3n ). Therefore, ( 3n equiv 0 mod 5 ). This simplifies to ( n equiv 0 mod 5 ) because 3 and 5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). So, ( n ) must be a multiple of 5. That means ( n = 5k ) for some integer ( k ).Alright, so now I know that ( n ) must be a multiple of 5. Let me substitute ( n = 5k ) into the original expression to check for divisibility by 3.Substituting ( n = 5k ) into ( 5n^2 + 3n - 5 ), we get:( 5(5k)^2 + 3(5k) - 5 = 5(25k^2) + 15k - 5 = 125k^2 + 15k - 5 ).Now, I need this expression to be divisible by 3. Let me write this as:( 125k^2 + 15k - 5 equiv 0 mod 3 ).Let me simplify each term modulo 3:- ( 125k^2 mod 3 ): 125 divided by 3 is 41 with a remainder of 2, so ( 125 equiv 2 mod 3 ). Thus, ( 125k^2 equiv 2k^2 mod 3 ).- ( 15k mod 3 ): 15 is divisible by 3, so ( 15k equiv 0 mod 3 ).- ( -5 mod 3 ): 5 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 2, so ( -5 equiv -2 mod 3 ).Putting it all together:( 2k^2 + 0 - 2 equiv 0 mod 3 )  Simplifying:  ( 2k^2 - 2 equiv 0 mod 3 )  Add 2 to both sides:  ( 2k^2 equiv 2 mod 3 )  Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 3 are coprime, division is allowed):  ( k^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ).So, ( k^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ). The solutions to this congruence are ( k equiv 1 mod 3 ) or ( k equiv 2 mod 3 ). Because when you square 1 or 2 modulo 3, you get 1.Therefore, ( k ) can be written as ( k = 3m + 1 ) or ( k = 3m + 2 ) for some integer ( m ).Now, substituting back into ( n = 5k ):1. If ( k = 3m + 1 ), then ( n = 5(3m + 1) = 15m + 5 ).2. If ( k = 3m + 2 ), then ( n = 5(3m + 2) = 15m + 10 ).So, the possible values of ( n ) are numbers of the form ( 15m + 5 ) or ( 15m + 10 ).Now, I need to find all such ( n ) less than 100. Let's list them out.Starting with ( n = 15m + 5 ):- For ( m = 0 ): ( n = 5 )- ( m = 1 ): ( n = 20 )- ( m = 2 ): ( n = 35 )- ( m = 3 ): ( n = 50 )- ( m = 4 ): ( n = 65 )- ( m = 5 ): ( n = 80 )- ( m = 6 ): ( n = 95 ) (since ( 15*6 +5 = 95 ), and ( 15*7 +5 = 110 ) which is over 100)Now for ( n = 15m + 10 ):- ( m = 0 ): ( n = 10 )- ( m = 1 ): ( n = 25 )- ( m = 2 ): ( n = 40 )- ( m = 3 ): ( n = 55 )- ( m = 4 ): ( n = 70 )- ( m = 5 ): ( n = 85 )- ( m = 6 ): ( n = 100 ), but since ( n ) must be less than 100, we stop at ( m = 5 ) giving ( n = 85 ).So, compiling all these values:From ( 15m + 5 ): 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95  From ( 15m + 10 ): 10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85Now, let me list them all together:5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40, 50, 55, 65, 70, 80, 85, 95Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any or duplicate any. Let me count:From the first sequence: 7 numbers  From the second sequence: 6 numbers  Total: 13 numbers.Let me list them in order:5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40, 50, 55, 65, 70, 80, 85, 95Yes, that's 13 numbers. Now, I need to sum all these numbers.Let me add them step by step:Start with 5.5 + 10 = 15  15 + 20 = 35  35 + 25 = 60  60 + 35 = 95  95 + 40 = 135  135 + 50 = 185  185 + 55 = 240  240 + 65 = 305  305 + 70 = 375  375 + 80 = 455  455 + 85 = 540  540 + 95 = 635So, the total sum is 635.Let me cross-verify this sum to make sure I didn't make a mistake in addition.Alternatively, I can pair numbers to make addition easier.Looking at the list: 5, 10, 20, 25, 35, 40, 50, 55, 65, 70, 80, 85, 95Pairing 5 and 95: 5 + 95 = 100  10 and 85: 10 + 85 = 95  20 and 80: 20 + 80 = 100  25 and 70: 25 + 70 = 95  35 and 65: 35 + 65 = 100  40 and 55: 40 + 55 = 95  50 is left alone.So, adding these pairs:100 + 95 + 100 + 95 + 100 + 95 + 50Calculating step by step:Start with 100.  100 + 95 = 195  195 + 100 = 295  295 + 95 = 390  390 + 100 = 490  490 + 95 = 585  585 + 50 = 635Same result. So, the sum is indeed 635.Looking back at the options given: (A) 285, (B) 350, (C) 540, (D) 635.So, the correct answer is D) 635.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"If the graph of the function f(x) = |sin(omega x - frac{pi}{8})| (omega > 0) is shifted to the left by frac{pi}{12} units, and the resulting graph corresponds to an even function, then the minimum value of omega is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function and shifting its graph. Let me try to understand what it's asking.The function is f(x) = |sin(ωx - π/8)|, where ω is greater than 0. They say that if we shift this graph to the left by π/12 units, the resulting graph is an even function. I need to find the minimum value of ω.Hmm, okay. So first, shifting a graph to the left by π/12 units. I remember that shifting a function f(x) to the left by 'a' units is done by replacing x with x + a. So in this case, the shifted function would be f(x + π/12). Let me write that down.So, the original function is f(x) = |sin(ωx - π/8)|. After shifting left by π/12, the new function becomes:f_shifted(x) = |sin(ω(x + π/12) - π/8)|Let me simplify the argument inside the sine function:ω(x + π/12) - π/8 = ωx + ωπ/12 - π/8So, f_shifted(x) = |sin(ωx + (ωπ/12 - π/8))|Now, the problem states that this shifted function is an even function. An even function satisfies the condition f(x) = f(-x) for all x. So, I need to ensure that |sin(ωx + (ωπ/12 - π/8))| is equal to |sin(-ωx + (ωπ/12 - π/8))| for all x.Wait, let me think about that. If f_shifted(x) is even, then:|sin(ωx + φ)| = |sin(-ωx + φ)| for all x, where φ = ωπ/12 - π/8.Hmm, so |sin(ωx + φ)| must equal |sin(-ωx + φ)| for all x. Let me recall some trigonometric identities. I know that sin(-θ) = -sinθ, but since we have absolute values, the negative sign doesn't matter. So, |sin(-θ)| = |sinθ|.But in this case, the arguments are not just negatives of each other. Let me write out both expressions:Left side: |sin(ωx + φ)|Right side: |sin(-ωx + φ)|I need these two to be equal for all x. So, |sin(ωx + φ)| = |sin(-ωx + φ)|.Let me consider the sine function's properties. I know that sin(A) = sin(π - A). So, perhaps I can use that identity here.So, |sin(ωx + φ)| = |sin(-ωx + φ)| implies that either:1. sin(ωx + φ) = sin(-ωx + φ), or2. sin(ωx + φ) = -sin(-ωx + φ)But since we have absolute values, both cases would lead to the same conclusion because absolute value makes them positive.Wait, maybe a better approach is to set the arguments such that the sine function is symmetric about the y-axis, which is a characteristic of even functions.Alternatively, since the function is |sin(something)|, which is always non-negative, maybe the phase shift φ needs to be such that the sine function inside becomes an even function after the absolute value.Wait, another thought: the absolute value of sine is an even function if the argument inside is symmetric about the y-axis. So, perhaps the phase shift φ needs to make the sine function symmetric.Alternatively, maybe the function inside the absolute value, sin(ωx + φ), should be an odd function so that when we take the absolute value, it becomes even.Wait, let's think about that. If sin(ωx + φ) is an odd function, then |sin(ωx + φ)| would be even because |f(-x)| = | -f(x) | = |f(x)|.So, for sin(ωx + φ) to be odd, it must satisfy sin(ω(-x) + φ) = -sin(ωx + φ).Let me write that condition:sin(-ωx + φ) = -sin(ωx + φ)Using the sine identity, sin(-θ) = -sinθ, so:sin(-ωx + φ) = sin(φ - ωx) = sin(φ)cos(ωx) - cos(φ)sin(ωx)On the other hand, -sin(ωx + φ) = -[sin(ωx)cosφ + cos(ωx)sinφ] = -sin(ωx)cosφ - cos(ωx)sinφSo, setting them equal:sinφ cosωx - cosφ sinωx = -sinωx cosφ - cosωx sinφLet me rearrange terms:sinφ cosωx - cosφ sinωx + sinωx cosφ + cosωx sinφ = 0Combine like terms:[sinφ cosωx + cosωx sinφ] + [-cosφ sinωx + sinωx cosφ] = 0Each bracket simplifies:2 sinφ cosωx + 0 = 0So, 2 sinφ cosωx = 0 for all x.But this must hold for all x, which is only possible if sinφ = 0.So, sinφ = 0 implies φ = kπ, where k is an integer.But φ is equal to ωπ/12 - π/8, so:ωπ/12 - π/8 = kπLet me solve for ω:ωπ/12 = kπ + π/8Divide both sides by π:ω/12 = k + 1/8Multiply both sides by 12:ω = 12k + 12*(1/8) = 12k + 3/2Since ω > 0, k must be a non-negative integer (k = 0, 1, 2, ...).To find the minimum value of ω, we take the smallest k, which is k = 0.So, ω = 0 + 3/2 = 3/2.Therefore, the minimum value of ω is 3/2.Wait, let me double-check. If k = 0, then φ = -π/8. So, the shifted function becomes |sin(ωx - π/8)| shifted left by π/12, which is |sin(ωx + ωπ/12 - π/8)|. If φ = -π/8, then ωπ/12 - π/8 = -π/8, so ωπ/12 = 0, which would imply ω = 0, but ω must be greater than 0. Hmm, that seems contradictory.Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's go back.We had φ = ωπ/12 - π/8 = kπ.So, solving for ω:ωπ/12 = kπ + π/8Divide both sides by π:ω/12 = k + 1/8Multiply by 12:ω = 12k + 12*(1/8) = 12k + 3/2So, for k = 0, ω = 3/2.But then φ = (3/2)*π/12 - π/8 = (π/8) - π/8 = 0.Wait, that makes φ = 0.So, the shifted function becomes |sin(ωx + 0)| = |sin(ωx)|, which is indeed an even function because |sin(ωx)| = |sin(-ωx)|.So, that works. So, when ω = 3/2, the shifted function is |sin(3/2 x)|, which is even.Therefore, the minimum value of ω is 3/2.I think that makes sense. Let me just verify with k = 0:φ = ωπ/12 - π/8 = (3/2)π/12 - π/8 = (π/8) - π/8 = 0.So, the shifted function is |sin(3/2 x)|, which is even because |sin(3/2 (-x))| = | -sin(3/2 x) | = |sin(3/2 x)|.Yes, that checks out. So, the minimum ω is 3/2."},{"question":"Given a function f(x) = x^2 - 2cos x, determine the relationship between f(0), fleft(-frac{1}{3}right), and fleft(frac{2}{5}right).","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x² - 2cosx, and I need to figure out the relationship between f(0), f(-1/3), and f(2/5). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, maybe I should calculate each of these values individually. That way, I can compare them directly. Let me start with f(0). Plugging in x = 0, I get f(0) = 0² - 2cos(0). Cos(0) is 1, so f(0) = 0 - 2*1 = -2. Okay, so f(0) is -2.Next, let's find f(-1/3). So, x = -1/3. Plugging that in, f(-1/3) = (-1/3)² - 2cos(-1/3). The square of -1/3 is 1/9, so that's 1/9. Now, cos(-1/3) is the same as cos(1/3) because cosine is an even function. So, cos(1/3) is approximately... let me think, cos(0) is 1, and as the angle increases, cosine decreases. So, cos(1/3) is slightly less than 1. Maybe around 0.94 or something? I'm not sure of the exact value, but I can keep it as cos(1/3) for now. So, f(-1/3) = 1/9 - 2cos(1/3).Similarly, for f(2/5), x = 2/5. So, f(2/5) = (2/5)² - 2cos(2/5). (2/5)² is 4/25, which is 0.16. Cos(2/5) is also slightly less than 1, but since 2/5 is a bit larger than 1/3, cos(2/5) will be a bit smaller than cos(1/3). So, cos(2/5) is approximately... maybe around 0.85? Again, not exact, but I can keep it as cos(2/5).Now, I need to compare these three values: f(0) = -2, f(-1/3) = 1/9 - 2cos(1/3), and f(2/5) = 4/25 - 2cos(2/5). Hmm, this is a bit tricky because I don't have exact values for the cosines. Maybe I can find a way to compare them without calculating the exact decimals.Wait, I remember that the cosine function decreases as the angle increases from 0 to π/2. Since 1/3 and 2/5 are both less than π/2 (which is about 1.57), and 2/5 is larger than 1/3, cos(2/5) should be less than cos(1/3). So, cos(2/5) < cos(1/3).Therefore, -2cos(2/5) is greater than -2cos(1/3) because multiplying by a negative reverses the inequality. So, -2cos(2/5) > -2cos(1/3).Now, looking at f(-1/3) and f(2/5):f(-1/3) = 1/9 - 2cos(1/3)f(2/5) = 4/25 - 2cos(2/5)Since 4/25 is approximately 0.16 and 1/9 is approximately 0.111, 4/25 is larger than 1/9. Also, as we established, -2cos(2/5) is larger than -2cos(1/3). So, both the x² term and the cosine term in f(2/5) are larger than those in f(-1/3). Therefore, f(2/5) should be greater than f(-1/3).So, putting it all together:f(0) = -2f(-1/3) = 1/9 - 2cos(1/3) ≈ 0.111 - 2*(0.94) ≈ 0.111 - 1.88 ≈ -1.769f(2/5) = 4/25 - 2cos(2/5) ≈ 0.16 - 2*(0.85) ≈ 0.16 - 1.7 ≈ -1.54Wait, that doesn't make sense because -1.54 is greater than -1.769, which is greater than -2. So, f(0) < f(-1/3) < f(2/5). That seems to be the order.But let me double-check my approximations because I might have made a mistake there. Cos(1/3) is approximately cos(0.333) ≈ 0.944, so -2cos(1/3) ≈ -1.888. Then, 1/9 ≈ 0.111, so f(-1/3) ≈ 0.111 - 1.888 ≈ -1.777.Similarly, cos(2/5) is cos(0.4) ≈ 0.921, so -2cos(2/5) ≈ -1.842. Then, 4/25 = 0.16, so f(2/5) ≈ 0.16 - 1.842 ≈ -1.682.So, f(0) = -2, f(-1/3) ≈ -1.777, f(2/5) ≈ -1.682. Therefore, f(0) < f(-1/3) < f(2/5). That seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the derivative of f(x) to see if the function is increasing or decreasing around these points. The derivative f'(x) = 2x + 2sinx. For x > 0, both 2x and 2sinx are positive, so f'(x) > 0. That means f(x) is increasing for x > 0. Since f(x) is even (because x² and cosx are both even functions), f(-x) = f(x). So, f(-1/3) = f(1/3). And since f(x) is increasing for x > 0, f(1/3) < f(2/5). Therefore, f(-1/3) < f(2/5). Also, f(0) is less than f(1/3) because f is increasing from 0 onwards. So, f(0) < f(-1/3) < f(2/5).Yeah, that makes sense. So, the relationship is f(0) < f(-1/3) < f(2/5)."},{"question":"Given that the function f(x) is defined on the set of real numbers mathbb{R} and is an odd function with a period of 3, and tan alpha = 3, find f(2015 sin 2alpha) = underline{hspace{1cm}}A: -1B: 0C: 1D: 2016","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of the function f at a certain point. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.The function f(x) is defined on all real numbers, which means it's defined everywhere. It's an odd function, and it has a period of 3. Also, we're given that tan α equals 3, and we need to find f(2015 sin 2α). The options are A: -1, B: 0, C: 1, D: 2016.Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I remember that an odd function has the property f(-x) = -f(x). That might come in handy later. Also, the function has a period of 3, which means that f(x + 3) = f(x) for any real number x. So, the function repeats every 3 units. That's useful because it allows us to reduce the argument of the function to a simpler equivalent value within one period.Now, we're given tan α = 3. I need to find sin 2α. Hmm, okay, so I remember that there's a double-angle formula for sine: sin 2α = 2 sin α cos α. But since I know tan α, maybe I can find sin α and cos α from that.Let me recall that tan α = opposite over adjacent in a right triangle. So, if tan α = 3, I can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is 3 and the adjacent side is 1. Then, the hypotenuse would be sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10). So, sin α would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is 3/sqrt(10), and cos α would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is 1/sqrt(10).Therefore, sin 2α = 2 sin α cos α = 2*(3/sqrt(10))*(1/sqrt(10)) = 2*(3/10) = 6/10 = 3/5. Okay, so sin 2α is 3/5.Now, the argument of the function f is 2015 sin 2α, which is 2015*(3/5). Let me compute that: 2015 divided by 5 is 403, so 403*3 is 1209. So, f(2015 sin 2α) is f(1209).But wait, the function f has a period of 3, so f(1209) is the same as f(1209 mod 3). Let me compute 1209 divided by 3. 3 goes into 12 four times, 4*3 is 12, subtract 12, bring down 0, 3 goes into 0 zero times, bring down 9, 3 goes into 9 three times. So, 1209 divided by 3 is 403 with no remainder. Therefore, 1209 mod 3 is 0. So, f(1209) is f(0).Now, since f is an odd function, f(-0) = -f(0). But f(-0) is just f(0), so f(0) = -f(0). The only number that is equal to its own negative is zero. Therefore, f(0) must be 0.So, putting it all together, f(2015 sin 2α) = f(1209) = f(0) = 0.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, tan α = 3, so I constructed a right triangle with opposite side 3, adjacent side 1, hypotenuse sqrt(10). That seems right. Then, sin α = 3/sqrt(10), cos α = 1/sqrt(10). Then, sin 2α = 2*(3/sqrt(10))*(1/sqrt(10)) = 6/10 = 3/5. That looks correct.Then, 2015*(3/5). Let me compute 2015 divided by 5: 5*400 = 2000, so 2015 - 2000 = 15, so 15/5 = 3. Therefore, 2015/5 = 403, so 403*3 = 1209. That's correct.Then, 1209 divided by 3: 3*400 = 1200, so 1209 - 1200 = 9, which is 3*3. So, 400 + 3 = 403, so 1209 = 3*403, so 1209 mod 3 is 0. Therefore, f(1209) = f(0). Since f is odd, f(0) = 0. So, yes, that seems right.I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 0, which is option B."},{"question":"In a certain sequence the first term is a_1=3001 and the second term is a_2=3002.

The first term is a₁ = 3001, and the second term is a₂ = 3002. The rule given is that for any n ≥ 1, the sum of three consecutive terms is equal to 2n + 1. So, aₙ + aₙ₊₁ + aₙ₊₂ = 2n + 1. My goal is to find a₁₀₀₀.Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I know the first two terms, so maybe I can find the third term using the given formula. Let me plug in n = 1 into the equation:a₁ + a₂ + a₃ = 2(1) + 1 = 3.So, 3001 + 3002 + a₃ = 3. That means a₃ = 3 - 3001 - 3002. Let me calculate that:3 - 3001 is -2998, and then subtracting 3002 gives me -6000. So, a₃ = -6000.Alright, now I have a₁, a₂, and a₃. Let's try to find a₄ using n = 2:a₂ + a₃ + a₄ = 2(2) + 1 = 5.So, 3002 + (-6000) + a₄ = 5. That simplifies to -2998 + a₄ = 5. Therefore, a₄ = 5 + 2998 = 3003.Okay, so a₄ is 3003. Let's see if a pattern is emerging here. So far, the terms are:a₁ = 3001a₂ = 3002a₃ = -6000a₄ = 3003Hmm, interesting. Let me try to find a₅ using n = 3:a₃ + a₄ + a₅ = 2(3) + 1 = 7.So, (-6000) + 3003 + a₅ = 7. That simplifies to -2997 + a₅ = 7. Therefore, a₅ = 7 + 2997 = 3004.Alright, a₅ is 3004. Let's find a₆ using n = 4:a₄ + a₅ + a₆ = 2(4) + 1 = 9.So, 3003 + 3004 + a₆ = 9. That adds up to 6007 + a₆ = 9. Therefore, a₆ = 9 - 6007 = -6000 + 2 = -6000? Wait, 9 - 6007 is -5998. Hmm, that's different from a₃, which was -6000. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me check that again. a₄ is 3003, a₅ is 3004, so 3003 + 3004 is 6007. Then, 6007 + a₆ = 9, so a₆ = 9 - 6007 = -5998. Okay, so a₆ is -5998.Wait, that's not the same as a₃, which was -6000. So, maybe there's a pattern where every third term is negative, but not exactly the same. Let me see:a₁ = 3001a₂ = 3002a₃ = -6000a₄ = 3003a₅ = 3004a₆ = -5998Hmm, so a₃ is -6000, a₆ is -5998, which is 2 more than -6000. Let me check a₇ to see if this pattern continues.Using n = 5:a₅ + a₆ + a₇ = 2(5) + 1 = 11.So, 3004 + (-5998) + a₇ = 11. That simplifies to -2994 + a₇ = 11. Therefore, a₇ = 11 + 2994 = 3005.Okay, a₇ is 3005. Let's find a₈ using n = 6:a₆ + a₇ + a₈ = 2(6) + 1 = 13.So, (-5998) + 3005 + a₈ = 13. That adds up to (-5998 + 3005) = -2993. So, -2993 + a₈ = 13. Therefore, a₈ = 13 + 2993 = 3006.Alright, a₈ is 3006. Let's find a₉ using n = 7:a₇ + a₈ + a₉ = 2(7) + 1 = 15.So, 3005 + 3006 + a₉ = 15. That adds up to 6011 + a₉ = 15. Therefore, a₉ = 15 - 6011 = -5996.Hmm, so a₉ is -5996. So, a₃ was -6000, a₆ was -5998, a₉ is -5996. It seems like every three terms, the negative term increases by 2. So, from a₃ to a₆, it's +2, from a₆ to a₉, it's +2 again. So, maybe this pattern continues.So, the negative terms are at positions 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., and each time, the value increases by 2. So, a₃ = -6000, a₆ = -5998, a₉ = -5996, a₁₂ = -5994, and so on.Meanwhile, the positive terms are increasing by 1 each time. So, a₁ = 3001, a₂ = 3002, a₄ = 3003, a₅ = 3004, a₇ = 3005, a₈ = 3006, etc.So, if I can figure out the pattern, maybe I can find a general formula for aₙ.Let me try to see if there's a recurrence relation or a pattern that can help me find aₙ.Looking at the terms:n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,...aₙ: 3001, 3002, -6000, 3003, 3004, -5998, 3005, 3006, -5996, 3007, 3008, -5994,...So, every time n is a multiple of 3, the term is negative, and it's increasing by 2 each time. The other terms are just increasing by 1.So, maybe I can separate the sequence into two parts: one for terms where n is not a multiple of 3, and one for terms where n is a multiple of 3.For terms where n is not a multiple of 3, it seems like aₙ = 3000 + n. Let's check:a₁ = 3000 + 1 = 3001 ✔️a₂ = 3000 + 2 = 3002 ✔️a₄ = 3000 + 4 = 3004? Wait, no, a₄ is 3003. Hmm, that doesn't fit.Wait, a₄ is 3003, which is 3000 + 3. a₅ is 3004, which is 3000 + 4. a₇ is 3005, which is 3000 + 5. a₈ is 3006, which is 3000 + 6. So, actually, for n not divisible by 3, aₙ = 3000 + (n - 0). Wait, that doesn't make sense because a₄ is 3003, which is 3000 + 3, but n=4. Hmm, maybe it's aₙ = 3000 + (n - 0) when n is not divisible by 3.Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the positive terms follow aₙ = 3000 + k, where k is the term's position in the positive sequence.But let's see:Positive terms are at positions 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,...So, for n=1: k=1, a₁=3001=3000+1n=2: k=2, a₂=3002=3000+2n=4: k=3, a₄=3003=3000+3n=5: k=4, a₅=3004=3000+4n=7: k=5, a₇=3005=3000+5n=8: k=6, a₈=3006=3000+6So, it seems that for positive terms, aₙ = 3000 + k, where k is the position in the positive sequence. But how does k relate to n?Looking at the positions:n: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,...So, for n=1, k=1n=2, k=2n=4, k=3n=5, k=4n=7, k=5n=8, k=6So, it seems that k = n - floor((n-1)/3). Let me test that.For n=1: floor((1-1)/3)=floor(0/3)=0, so k=1-0=1 ✔️n=2: floor((2-1)/3)=floor(1/3)=0, so k=2-0=2 ✔️n=4: floor((4-1)/3)=floor(3/3)=1, so k=4-1=3 ✔️n=5: floor((5-1)/3)=floor(4/3)=1, so k=5-1=4 ✔️n=7: floor((7-1)/3)=floor(6/3)=2, so k=7-2=5 ✔️n=8: floor((8-1)/3)=floor(7/3)=2, so k=8-2=6 ✔️Okay, that seems to work. So, for positive terms, aₙ = 3000 + (n - floor((n-1)/3)).But wait, that might be a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.Alternatively, since every three terms, the positive terms increase by 1 each time, and the negative terms are in between.Wait, let's think about the negative terms. They occur at n=3,6,9,12,... So, n=3m where m is a positive integer.At n=3: a₃=-6000n=6: a₆=-5998n=9: a₉=-5996n=12: a₁₂=-5994So, each time m increases by 1, the negative term increases by 2. So, a₃m = -6000 + 2(m-1).Let me test that:For m=1: a₃ = -6000 + 2(0) = -6000 ✔️m=2: a₆ = -6000 + 2(1) = -5998 ✔️m=3: a₉ = -6000 + 2(2) = -5996 ✔️m=4: a₁₂ = -6000 + 2(3) = -5994 ✔️Yes, that works. So, a₃m = -6000 + 2(m-1) = -6000 + 2m - 2 = -6002 + 2m.Alternatively, a₃m = -6002 + 2m.So, for n=3m, aₙ = -6002 + 2m.But n=3m, so m = n/3. Therefore, aₙ = -6002 + 2*(n/3) = -6002 + (2n)/3.But since n is a multiple of 3, 2n/3 is an integer.So, for n divisible by 3, aₙ = -6002 + (2n)/3.Now, for the positive terms, which are at n not divisible by 3.Looking back, for n=1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,..., the terms are 3001,3002,3003,3004,3005,3006,3007,3008,...So, it's just increasing by 1 each time, starting from 3001.But how does n relate to the term value?Let me see:n=1: 3001n=2: 3002n=4: 3003n=5: 3004n=7: 3005n=8: 3006So, for n=1,2,4,5,7,8,..., the term is 3000 + (number of positive terms up to n).Wait, let's count the number of positive terms up to n.For n=1: 1 positive termn=2: 2 positive termsn=3: 2 positive terms (since n=3 is negative)n=4: 3 positive termsn=5: 4 positive termsn=6: 4 positive termsn=7: 5 positive termsn=8: 6 positive termsn=9: 6 positive termsSo, the number of positive terms up to n is equal to n - floor(n/3).Because every 3 terms, one is negative, so the number of positive terms is n minus the number of negative terms up to n.Since negative terms are at n=3,6,9,..., the number of negative terms up to n is floor(n/3).Therefore, the number of positive terms up to n is n - floor(n/3).But in our case, for positive terms, the term value is 3000 + (number of positive terms up to n). Wait, let's check:For n=1: 3000 + 1 = 3001 ✔️n=2: 3000 + 2 = 3002 ✔️n=4: 3000 + 3 = 3003 ✔️n=5: 3000 + 4 = 3004 ✔️n=7: 3000 + 5 = 3005 ✔️n=8: 3000 + 6 = 3006 ✔️Yes, that seems to fit. So, for positive terms, aₙ = 3000 + (number of positive terms up to n) = 3000 + (n - floor(n/3)).Wait, but let's test it for n=4:a₄ = 30033000 + (4 - floor(4/3)) = 3000 + (4 - 1) = 3000 + 3 = 3003 ✔️n=5:3000 + (5 - floor(5/3)) = 3000 + (5 - 1) = 3004 ✔️n=7:3000 + (7 - floor(7/3)) = 3000 + (7 - 2) = 3005 ✔️n=8:3000 + (8 - floor(8/3)) = 3000 + (8 - 2) = 3006 ✔️Great, so for positive terms, aₙ = 3000 + (n - floor(n/3)).But wait, let's see if this formula works for n=3:a₃ = -6000Using the formula: 3000 + (3 - floor(3/3)) = 3000 + (3 - 1) = 3002, which is not equal to -6000. So, this formula only applies to positive terms, which are when n is not divisible by 3.So, to summarize:If n is not divisible by 3, then aₙ = 3000 + (n - floor(n/3)).If n is divisible by 3, then aₙ = -6002 + (2n)/3.Now, we need to find a₁₀₀₀.First, let's check if 1000 is divisible by 3.Dividing 1000 by 3: 3*333=999, so 1000 = 3*333 + 1. So, 1000 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we use the formula for positive terms:a₁₀₀₀ = 3000 + (1000 - floor(1000/3)).Calculate floor(1000/3):1000 divided by 3 is approximately 333.333..., so floor(1000/3) = 333.Therefore, a₁₀₀₀ = 3000 + (1000 - 333) = 3000 + 667 = 3667.Wait, that can't be right because when I look at the initial terms, the positive terms are increasing by 1 each time, but starting from 3001. So, term 1:3001, term2:3002, term4:3003, term5:3004, etc. So, the positive terms are increasing by 1 each time, but they are spaced out every two terms.Wait, maybe my formula is incorrect. Let me think again.Alternatively, since every three terms, the positive terms increase by 1 each time, but the negative term is in between.Wait, perhaps it's better to model the sequence as having a period of 3, with two positive terms and one negative term.So, for n ≡1 mod 3, n≡2 mod 3, and n≡0 mod 3.So, for n ≡1 mod 3: aₙ = 3000 + kn ≡2 mod 3: aₙ = 3000 + kn ≡0 mod 3: aₙ = -6002 + 2m, where m is the number of negative terms up to n.Wait, maybe that's complicating things.Alternatively, let's consider that for each group of three terms, the first two are positive and increasing by 1, and the third is negative, increasing by 2 each time.So, group 1: a₁=3001, a₂=3002, a₃=-6000Group 2: a₄=3003, a₅=3004, a₆=-5998Group 3: a₇=3005, a₈=3006, a₉=-5996And so on.So, in each group, the first term is 3001 + 2*(group number -1), the second term is 3002 + 2*(group number -1), and the third term is -6000 + 2*(group number -1).Wait, let's see:Group 1: group number=1a₁=3001 + 2*(0)=3001a₂=3002 + 2*(0)=3002a₃=-6000 + 2*(0)=-6000Group 2: group number=2a₄=3001 + 2*(1)=3003a₅=3002 + 2*(1)=3004a₆=-6000 + 2*(1)=-5998Group 3: group number=3a₇=3001 + 2*(2)=3005a₈=3002 + 2*(2)=3006a₉=-6000 + 2*(2)=-5996Yes, that seems to fit.So, for group number m, the terms are:a_{3m-2} = 3001 + 2*(m-1)a_{3m-1} = 3002 + 2*(m-1)a_{3m} = -6000 + 2*(m-1)So, for any n, we can find which group it belongs to.Given n, we can find m such that 3m-2 ≤ n ≤ 3m.So, m = ceil(n/3).Wait, let's test that.For n=1: m=ceil(1/3)=1n=2: m=ceil(2/3)=1n=3: m=ceil(3/3)=1n=4: m=ceil(4/3)=2n=5: m=ceil(5/3)=2n=6: m=ceil(6/3)=2Yes, that works.So, for any n, m = ceil(n/3).Then, depending on the position within the group:If n ≡1 mod 3: aₙ = 3001 + 2*(m-1)If n ≡2 mod 3: aₙ = 3002 + 2*(m-1)If n ≡0 mod 3: aₙ = -6000 + 2*(m-1)So, let's apply this to n=1000.First, find m = ceil(1000/3).1000 divided by 3 is approximately 333.333..., so ceil(1000/3)=334.Now, find the position of n=1000 within group m=334.Since group 334 contains n=3*334-2=1000, n=1001, n=1002.Wait, no:Wait, group m=334 would be:a_{3*334 -2} = a_{1000} = 3001 + 2*(334-1) = 3001 + 2*333 = 3001 + 666 = 3667a_{3*334 -1} = a_{1001} = 3002 + 2*(334-1) = 3002 + 666 = 3668a_{3*334} = a_{1002} = -6000 + 2*(334-1) = -6000 + 666 = -5334Wait, but n=1000 is the first term in group 334, so it's a_{3*334 -2} = a_{1000} = 3001 + 2*(334-1) = 3667.Wait, but earlier I thought aₙ = 3000 + (n - floor(n/3)).Let me check that formula for n=1000:a₁₀₀₀ = 3000 + (1000 - floor(1000/3)) = 3000 + (1000 - 333) = 3000 + 667 = 3667.Yes, that matches.So, both methods give the same result.Therefore, a₁₀₀₀ = 3667.Wait, but in the initial terms, a₄=3003, which is 3000 + (4 -1)=3003, which matches.Similarly, a₅=3004=3000 + (5 -1)=3004.a₇=3005=3000 + (7 -2)=3005.Yes, so the formula aₙ = 3000 + (n - floor(n/3)) works for positive terms.Therefore, for n=1000, a₁₀₀₀=3000 + (1000 - 333)=3667.So, the answer is 3667.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a solution where a_{1000}=3334. That's different from my result. Did I make a mistake?Wait, let me double-check.In the initial problem, the user wrote:\\"Thus, a_{n+3} - a_n = 1 by observing the pattern and using the relation derived from the recurrence relation: a_{n+3} - a_n = 1.Hence, to find a_{1000}:a₁ = 3001, a₄ = 3003, a₇ = 3004, …a_{1000} = 3001 + floor(999/3) = 3001 + 333 = 3334.\\"Wait, so according to the user, a_{n+3} - a_n =1, so every three terms, the value increases by 1.But in my calculation, I found that a₁₀₀₀=3667, which is much larger.Wait, let's see. If a_{n+3} - a_n =1, then starting from a₁=3001, a₄=3002, a₇=3003, etc. But in reality, from the initial terms, a₁=3001, a₄=3003, which is an increase of 2 over 3 terms, not 1.Wait, that contradicts the user's claim.Wait, let's see:From n=1: a₁=3001n=4: a₄=3003So, a₄ - a₁=2 over 3 terms.Similarly, a₇ - a₄=3005 - 3003=2 over 3 terms.So, actually, a_{n+3} - a_n=2, not 1.Therefore, the user's claim that a_{n+3} - a_n=1 is incorrect.So, my initial calculation of a₁₀₀₀=3667 is correct, while the user's answer of 3334 is incorrect.Wait, but let's see.If a_{n+3} - a_n=2, then starting from a₁=3001, a₄=3003, a₇=3005, etc.So, for n=1 + 3k, a_n=3001 + 2k.Similarly, for n=2 + 3k, a_n=3002 + 2k.For n=3 + 3k, a_n=-6000 + 2k.So, for n=1000, which is 1 + 3*333=1000, so k=333.Therefore, a₁₀₀₀=3001 + 2*333=3001 + 666=3667.Yes, that's correct.So, the user's answer was wrong because they incorrectly assumed that a_{n+3} - a_n=1, whereas it's actually 2.Therefore, the correct answer is 3667.But wait, let me check again.Wait, in the initial terms:a₁=3001a₄=3003 (difference of 2 over 3 terms)a₇=3005 (difference of 2 over 3 terms)So, yes, a_{n+3}=a_n +2.Therefore, for n=1 +3k, a_n=3001 +2k.Similarly, for n=2 +3k, a_n=3002 +2k.For n=3 +3k, a_n=-6000 +2k.So, for n=1000, which is 1 +3*333, k=333.Thus, a₁₀₀₀=3001 +2*333=3001 +666=3667.Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the correct answer is 3667."},{"question":"The monthly rent of a shop of dimension 20 feet × 18 feet is Rs. 1440.

Prove that this function is differentiable at every point ( x = sqrt{k} ), where ( k ) is a natural number that is not a perfect square.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f defined on the real numbers. It's zero for all irrational numbers, and for rational numbers p/q in their lowest terms, it's 1 over q cubed. I need to prove that this function is differentiable at every point x equals the square root of k, where k is a natural number that's not a perfect square. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall what differentiable means. A function is differentiable at a point if the limit of [f(x) - f(a)] / (x - a) as x approaches a exists. In this case, a is sqrt(k), and f(a) is zero because sqrt(k) is irrational (since k isn't a perfect square). So, the difference quotient simplifies to f(x)/(x - sqrt(k)).Now, I need to evaluate the limit of f(x)/(x - sqrt(k)) as x approaches sqrt(k). Since f(x) is zero for irrational x, the only contributions to the limit come from rational x near sqrt(k). So, I should focus on rational numbers p/q near sqrt(k).But how do I handle these rational numbers? Well, p/q can be written in lowest terms, so f(p/q) is 1/q³. So, the difference quotient becomes (1/q³)/(p/q - sqrt(k)).I need to analyze this expression as p/q approaches sqrt(k). Since p/q is approaching sqrt(k), the denominator p/q - sqrt(k) is getting very small. But the numerator is 1/q³, which depends on q. So, I need to understand how q behaves as p/q approaches sqrt(k).I remember that for irrational numbers, there are infinitely many rational approximations p/q, but their denominators q can't be too small. In fact, for any irrational number alpha, there are infinitely many p/q such that |alpha - p/q| < 1/q². But in our case, we have f(p/q) = 1/q³, so maybe the decay of f(p/q) is fast enough to make the limit zero.Wait, let me think more carefully. If I can show that |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| is bounded by something that goes to zero as x approaches sqrt(k), then the limit exists and is zero.So, let's write |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = |1/q³ / (p/q - sqrt(k))|. Let me rewrite this as |1/(q³ (p/q - sqrt(k)))| = |1/(q² (p - q sqrt(k)))|.So, |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = 1/(q² |p - q sqrt(k)|). Now, I need to bound this expression.I know that |p - q sqrt(k)| is at least 1/q because of the theory of Diophantine approximation. Specifically, for any irrational number alpha, there exists a constant c such that |alpha - p/q| > c / q² for all p/q. This is related to Dirichlet's approximation theorem.But in our case, sqrt(k) is a quadratic irrational, so maybe we can get a better bound. I think for quadratic irrationals, there's a result that says |sqrt(k) - p/q| > 1/(q sqrt(k) + 1) or something like that.Wait, actually, I recall that for any real number alpha, the inequality |alpha - p/q| < 1/q² has infinitely many solutions p/q, but for algebraic numbers of degree n, the inequality |alpha - p/q| < 1/q^{n+1} has only finitely many solutions. Since sqrt(k) is algebraic of degree 2, the inequality |sqrt(k) - p/q| < 1/q³ has only finitely many solutions.But in our case, we're looking at |p - q sqrt(k)|. Let me rearrange the inequality:|p - q sqrt(k)| < 1/q².But if |p - q sqrt(k)| < 1/q², then |sqrt(k) - p/q| < 1/(q³). So, for our function f(p/q) = 1/q³, the difference quotient is 1/(q³ (p/q - sqrt(k))) = 1/(q² (p - q sqrt(k))). If |p - q sqrt(k)| < 1/q², then |1/(q² (p - q sqrt(k)))| > q².But wait, that would mean that the difference quotient could be large if |p - q sqrt(k)| is very small. However, as I mentioned earlier, for quadratic irrationals, there are only finitely many p/q such that |sqrt(k) - p/q| < 1/q³. So, beyond a certain point, all p/q near sqrt(k) must satisfy |sqrt(k) - p/q| >= 1/q³.Therefore, for sufficiently large q, |p - q sqrt(k)| >= 1/q². So, |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = 1/(q² |p - q sqrt(k)|) <= 1/(q² * 1/q²) = 1.But that's not enough to conclude the limit is zero. I need a better bound.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that for any p/q, |p - q sqrt(k)| >= 1/(q sqrt(k) + 1). I think this is a result from the theory of continued fractions. For any real number alpha, there exists a constant c such that |alpha - p/q| > c / q² for all p/q.But for sqrt(k), which is a quadratic irrational, the constant c can be explicitly given. In fact, I think it's related to the discriminant of the quadratic field. But maybe I don't need the exact constant.Alternatively, I can use the fact that sqrt(k) is not rational, so p - q sqrt(k) is never zero, and thus |p - q sqrt(k)| is bounded below by some function of q.Wait, let's think differently. Let's consider the expression |p - q sqrt(k)|. If p/q is close to sqrt(k), then p is approximately q sqrt(k). So, p - q sqrt(k) is small. But how small can it be?From the theory of Diophantine approximation, for any irrational alpha, there are infinitely many p/q such that |alpha - p/q| < 1/q². But for quadratic irrationals, the inequality |alpha - p/q| < 1/(sqrt(5) q²) has infinitely many solutions, which is the Markoff constant.But in our case, we have f(p/q) = 1/q³, so the difference quotient is 1/(q³ (p/q - sqrt(k))) = 1/(q² (p - q sqrt(k))). If |p - q sqrt(k)| < 1/q², then the difference quotient is greater than q². But as q increases, this could be problematic.However, as I mentioned earlier, for quadratic irrationals, the inequality |sqrt(k) - p/q| < 1/q³ has only finitely many solutions. So, beyond a certain q, all p/q near sqrt(k) must satisfy |sqrt(k) - p/q| >= 1/q³.Therefore, for sufficiently large q, |p - q sqrt(k)| >= 1/q². So, |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = 1/(q² |p - q sqrt(k)|) <= 1/(q² * 1/q²) = 1.But again, this doesn't help me conclude the limit is zero. I need a better bound.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that |p - q sqrt(k)| >= 1/(q sqrt(k) + 1). Let me check this.Suppose |p - q sqrt(k)| < 1/(q sqrt(k) + 1). Then, multiplying both sides by q, we get |q p - q² sqrt(k)| < 1/(sqrt(k) + 1/q). But I'm not sure if this helps.Alternatively, let's consider the expression |p - q sqrt(k)|. Since p and q are integers, p - q sqrt(k) is a non-zero real number. The minimal value of |p - q sqrt(k)| over all integers p, q with q > 0 is achieved when p/q is the best approximation to sqrt(k).But I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I need to use a different approach.Let me think about the limit again. I need to show that as x approaches sqrt(k), f(x)/(x - sqrt(k)) approaches zero. For irrational x, f(x) is zero, so the difference quotient is zero. For rational x = p/q, f(x) = 1/q³, and the difference quotient is 1/(q³ (p/q - sqrt(k))).So, I need to show that for any sequence of rationals p/q approaching sqrt(k), the expression 1/(q³ (p/q - sqrt(k))) approaches zero.But how? Let's write p/q as sqrt(k) + delta, where delta approaches zero. Then, p = q sqrt(k) + q delta. Since p must be an integer, q delta must be close to an integer minus q sqrt(k). Hmm, this seems complicated.Alternatively, let's consider that as q increases, p must be approximately q sqrt(k). So, p = round(q sqrt(k)). Then, |p - q sqrt(k)| <= 1/2. So, |p - q sqrt(k)| <= 1/2.But then, |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = 1/(q² |p - q sqrt(k)|) >= 1/(q² * 1/2) = 2/q². As q increases, this goes to zero. Wait, but this is a lower bound. I need an upper bound.Wait, no, if |p - q sqrt(k)| <= 1/2, then |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = 1/(q² |p - q sqrt(k)|) >= 2/q². But I need to bound it above, not below.Hmm, maybe I need to consider that for large q, |p - q sqrt(k)| is not too small. Because if it were too small, then p/q would be a very good approximation to sqrt(k), which is a quadratic irrational, and such approximations are limited.I think I need to use the fact that for quadratic irrationals, the inequality |sqrt(k) - p/q| < 1/q² has only finitely many solutions. So, beyond a certain q, all p/q must satisfy |sqrt(k) - p/q| >= 1/q².Therefore, for sufficiently large q, |p - q sqrt(k)| >= 1/q. So, |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| = 1/(q² |p - q sqrt(k)|) <= 1/(q² * 1/q) = 1/q.As q approaches infinity, 1/q approaches zero. Therefore, for any sequence of rationals p/q approaching sqrt(k), the difference quotient 1/(q³ (p/q - sqrt(k))) approaches zero.But wait, does this hold? If |p - q sqrt(k)| >= 1/q, then |f(x)/(x - sqrt(k))| <= 1/q, which goes to zero as q increases. So, yes, the difference quotient is bounded by 1/q, which tends to zero.Therefore, combining both cases, whether x is irrational or rational, the difference quotient f(x)/(x - sqrt(k)) approaches zero as x approaches sqrt(k). Hence, the limit exists and is zero, which means f is differentiable at sqrt(k) with derivative zero.I think that makes sense. So, the key idea is that for quadratic irrationals like sqrt(k), the difference |p - q sqrt(k)| can't be too small for large q, which ensures that the difference quotient doesn't blow up and instead tends to zero."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_2 and a_6 are the two roots of the equation x^2 - 34x + 64 = 0. What is the value of a_4?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, the terms a_2 and a_6 are the two roots of the quadratic equation x² - 34x + 64 = 0. I need to find the value of a_4.First, I remember that in a quadratic equation of the form x² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b and the product of the roots is c. So, applying that here, the sum of the roots a_2 and a_6 should be 34, and their product should be 64. Let me write that down:a_2 + a_6 = 34  a_2 * a_6 = 64Since it's a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio r to get the next term. So, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term.Given that, let's express a_2 and a_6 in terms of a_1 and r:a_2 = a_1 * r  a_6 = a_1 * r^5So, substituting these into the equations we have:a_1 * r + a_1 * r^5 = 34  (a_1 * r) * (a_1 * r^5) = 64Let me simplify the second equation first because it looks like it might be easier. Multiplying the two terms:(a_1 * r) * (a_1 * r^5) = a_1² * r^6 = 64So, a_1² * r^6 = 64. Hmm, that's one equation.Now, looking at the first equation:a_1 * r + a_1 * r^5 = 34  a_1 * r (1 + r^4) = 34So, I have two equations:1. a_1 * r (1 + r^4) = 34  2. a_1² * r^6 = 64I think I can solve these simultaneously. Maybe I can express a_1 from the first equation and substitute into the second.From the first equation:a_1 = 34 / (r (1 + r^4))Substituting into the second equation:(34 / (r (1 + r^4)))² * r^6 = 64Let me compute that step by step.First, square the numerator and denominator:(34²) / (r² (1 + r^4)²) * r^6 = 64Simplify the r terms:r^6 / r² = r^4So, now we have:34² * r^4 / (1 + r^4)² = 64Compute 34 squared: 34 * 34 = 1156So, 1156 * r^4 / (1 + r^4)² = 64Let me write that as:1156 r^4 = 64 (1 + r^4)²Let me expand the right side:(1 + r^4)² = 1 + 2 r^4 + r^8So, 1156 r^4 = 64 (1 + 2 r^4 + r^8)Let me bring everything to one side:64 (1 + 2 r^4 + r^8) - 1156 r^4 = 0Compute 64 * 1 = 64  64 * 2 r^4 = 128 r^4  64 * r^8 = 64 r^8So, 64 + 128 r^4 + 64 r^8 - 1156 r^4 = 0Combine like terms:64 r^8 + (128 r^4 - 1156 r^4) + 64 = 0  64 r^8 - 1028 r^4 + 64 = 0Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 4 to make the numbers smaller:16 r^8 - 257 r^4 + 16 = 0Wait, 64 divided by 4 is 16, 1028 divided by 4 is 257, and 64 divided by 4 is 16. So, the equation becomes:16 r^8 - 257 r^4 + 16 = 0This looks like a quadratic in terms of r^4. Let me set y = r^4, then the equation becomes:16 y² - 257 y + 16 = 0Now, I can solve this quadratic equation for y. Using the quadratic formula:y = [257 ± sqrt(257² - 4 * 16 * 16)] / (2 * 16)Compute discriminant D:D = 257² - 4 * 16 * 16  257² is 66049  4 * 16 * 16 = 1024  So, D = 66049 - 1024 = 65025sqrt(65025) = 255So, y = [257 ± 255] / 32Compute both possibilities:First, y = (257 + 255)/32 = 512/32 = 16  Second, y = (257 - 255)/32 = 2/32 = 1/16So, y = 16 or y = 1/16But y = r^4, so:Case 1: r^4 = 16  Then, r = ±2Case 2: r^4 = 1/16  Then, r = ±(1/2)Now, let's consider each case.Case 1: r = 2  Then, from the first equation, a_1 = 34 / (r (1 + r^4))  Compute denominator: r (1 + r^4) = 2 (1 + 16) = 2 * 17 = 34  So, a_1 = 34 / 34 = 1So, a_1 = 1, r = 2Therefore, the sequence is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...So, a_2 = 2, a_4 = 8, a_6 = 32. That fits the quadratic equation's roots 2 and 32.Case 2: r = -2  Then, a_1 = 34 / (-2 (1 + (-2)^4)) = 34 / (-2 (1 + 16)) = 34 / (-2 * 17) = 34 / (-34) = -1So, a_1 = -1, r = -2Sequence: -1, 2, -4, 8, -16, 32, -64,...Here, a_2 = 2, a_6 = 32. So, same roots. But a_4 would be 8 as well, because a_4 = a_1 * r^3 = -1 * (-2)^3 = -1 * (-8) = 8So, regardless of r being positive or negative 2, a_4 is 8.Now, let's check the other case where y = 1/16, so r^4 = 1/16, so r = ±1/2Case 3: r = 1/2  Then, a_1 = 34 / ( (1/2) (1 + (1/2)^4 ))  Compute denominator: (1/2)(1 + 1/16) = (1/2)(17/16) = 17/32  So, a_1 = 34 / (17/32) = 34 * (32/17) = 2 * 32 = 64So, a_1 = 64, r = 1/2Sequence: 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1,...Here, a_2 = 32, a_6 = 2. So, the roots are 32 and 2, which is the same as before. Then, a_4 = 8.Case 4: r = -1/2  Then, a_1 = 34 / ( (-1/2) (1 + (-1/2)^4 ))  Compute denominator: (-1/2)(1 + 1/16) = (-1/2)(17/16) = -17/32  So, a_1 = 34 / (-17/32) = 34 * (-32/17) = -2 * 32 = -64So, a_1 = -64, r = -1/2Sequence: -64, 32, -16, 8, -4, 2, -1,...Here, a_2 = 32, a_6 = 2. So, same roots. Then, a_4 = 8.Therefore, in all cases, whether r is positive or negative, and whether r is 2 or 1/2, the value of a_4 is 8.So, the answer is 8."},{"question":"Let sequence A be a geometric sequence beginning at 3 with a common ratio of 3, and sequence B be an arithmetic sequence beginning at 5 with a common difference of 10.

Sequence A is a geometric sequence starting at 3 with a common ratio of 3. That means each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next one. So, the terms would be 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, and so on. But the sequence stops when a term exceeds 200. So, 243 is more than 200, so the last term is 81. So, sequence A is 3, 9, 27, 81.Then there's sequence B, which is an arithmetic sequence starting at 5 with a common difference of 10. That means each term increases by 10.

There are three characters: the Gray Horse, the Gray Mare, and the Bear Cub. Each has a different truth-telling behavior: the Gray Horse always lies, the Gray Mare sometimes lies, and the Bear Cub never lies.First, let's list out the statements:1. The one on the left says: \\"Next to me is the Bear Cub.\\"2. The one on the right says: \\"It was the Gray Mare who told you that.\\"3. The one in the center says: \\"To my left is the Gray Horse.\\"Okay, so we have three positions: left, center, and right. Each position is occupied by one of the three characters. Let's denote them as L, C, and R for simplicity.Given that the Bear Cub never lies, if the Bear Cub is in any position, their statement must be true. The Gray Horse always lies, so whatever they say is false. The Gray Mare sometimes lies, so her statements can be either true or false.Let's start by assuming the Bear Cub is in the left position. If that's the case, then the left one's statement \\"Next to me is the Bear Cub\\" would be true. But wait, if the Bear Cub is on the left, then the statement \\"Next to me is the Bear Cub\\" would mean that the Bear Cub is next to themselves, which doesn't make sense. So, the Bear Cub can't be on the left.Next, let's assume the Bear Cub is in the center. If the Bear Cub is in the center, then the center's statement \\"To my left is the Gray Horse\\" must be true. So, the left position must be the Gray Horse. Now, the left one's statement \\"Next to me is the Bear Cub\\" would be true because the Bear Cub is indeed next to them. But wait, the Gray Horse always lies, so if the left one is the Gray Horse, their statement should be false. This is a contradiction because the statement is true. Therefore, the Bear Cub can't be in the center either.Finally, let's assume the Bear Cub is on the right. If the Bear Cub is on the right, then the right one's statement \\"It was the Gray Mare who told you that\\" must be true. So, the left one must be the Gray Mare. Now, the left one's statement \\"Next to me is the Bear Cub\\" would be true because the Bear Cub is indeed next to them. But the Gray Mare sometimes lies, so this statement could be true or false. Let's check the center's statement: \\"To my left is the Gray Horse.\\" If the center is the Gray Horse, then this statement would be a lie, meaning the left is not the Gray Horse. But we already assumed the left is the Gray Mare, so this makes sense. Therefore, the center must be the Gray Horse, and the statements are consistent.So, putting it all together:- Left: Gray Mare- Center: Gray Horse- Right: Bear CubThis arrangement satisfies all the given conditions without any contradictions."},{"question":"At a people counting station, the number of people counted on the first day was twice the total number counted on the second day.

Let me read it again carefully.The proposition p is: For all x greater than or equal to 0, x cubed minus 1 is greater than or equal to 0. So, symbolically, that's ∀x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 ≥ 0. And the question is asking for the negation of p, which is ¬p. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different statements.Okay, so first, I remember that the negation of a universal quantifier is an existential quantifier. That is, if you have a statement that says \\"for all x, P(x)\\" is true, then the negation would be \\"there exists an x such that P(x) is false.\\" So, ¬(∀x, P(x)) is equivalent to ∃x, ¬P(x).Applying that to this problem, the original proposition p is ∀x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 ≥ 0. So, the negation ¬p should be ∃x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 < 0. That makes sense because if it's not true that every x ≥ 0 satisfies x³ - 1 ≥ 0, then there must be at least one x ≥ 0 where x³ - 1 is less than 0.Let me check the options:A: ∀x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 < 0. Hmm, that's saying for all x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 is less than 0. That's too strong because the negation doesn't require every x to fail, just at least one. So A is not the correct negation.B: ∃x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 < 0. This matches what I was thinking earlier. It's saying there exists an x ≥ 0 where x³ - 1 is less than 0. That seems correct.C: ∃x < 0, x³ - 1 < 0. Wait, this is talking about x less than 0. But the original proposition was about x greater than or equal to 0. So, the negation shouldn't change the domain of x, right? It should still be about x ≥ 0. So C is talking about a different domain, which might not be related. Maybe x < 0 could be true or false, but it's not the negation of p.D: ∀A < 0, x³ - 1 < 0. Hmm, this is confusing. It's using A instead of x, and it's saying for all A less than 0, x³ - 1 is less than 0. That seems off because A is a different variable, and also, it's mixing up the domains. The original p was about x ≥ 0, so the negation should still be about x ≥ 0, not A < 0. Plus, it's using a universal quantifier again, which doesn't fit because the negation should be existential.So, going back, B seems to be the correct answer because it correctly negates the universal quantifier into an existential one and keeps the domain of x the same.Just to double-check, let's think about what p is saying. For all x ≥ 0, x³ - 1 is ≥ 0. So, is that true? Let's plug in some numbers. If x is 1, then 1³ - 1 = 0, which is equal to 0, so that's okay. If x is 2, 8 - 1 = 7, which is greater than 0. But what about x = 0? 0³ - 1 = -1, which is less than 0. So, actually, p is not true because when x is 0, x³ - 1 is negative. Therefore, the negation ¬p should be true, which is that there exists an x ≥ 0 where x³ - 1 < 0. And indeed, x = 0 is such a number. So, B is correct because it correctly identifies that such an x exists.C is talking about x < 0, but the original proposition was about x ≥ 0, so even if x < 0 had some property, it doesn't affect the negation of p. Similarly, D is using a different variable and a different domain, so it's not relevant.Therefore, after all this thinking, I'm confident that B is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Suppose the random variable X sim N(mu, sigma^{2}), and P(X > 5) = P(X < -1) = 0.2, then P(2 < X < 5) = ___.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a random variable X follows a normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ². The problem states that the probability of X being greater than 5 is 0.2, and the probability of X being less than -1 is also 0.2. I need to find the probability that X is between 2 and 5, that is, P(2 < X < 5).Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Since X is normally distributed, it's symmetric around its mean μ. The fact that P(X > 5) = 0.2 and P(X < -1) = 0.2 suggests that 5 and -1 are equidistant from the mean μ, but on opposite sides. That makes sense because in a normal distribution, the probabilities on either side of the mean are symmetric.So, if I can find the mean μ, that might help me figure out the rest. Since 5 and -1 are both 0.2 probabilities on either tail, the mean should be exactly halfway between them. Let me calculate that:μ = (5 + (-1)) / 2 = (5 - 1) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.Okay, so the mean μ is 2. That makes sense because the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, so the distances from μ to 5 and from μ to -1 should be equal.Now, knowing that μ is 2, I can think about the standard deviation σ. But wait, do I actually need σ to solve this problem? Let me see. I need to find P(2 < X < 5). Since 2 is the mean, and 5 is a point to the right of the mean, I can think of this as the probability that X is between the mean and some value above the mean.But I don't know σ yet. Maybe I can find σ using the given probabilities. Let's see. The probability that X is greater than 5 is 0.2. Since the total area under the normal curve is 1, the area to the right of 5 is 0.2, which means the area to the left of 5 is 0.8. Similarly, the area to the left of -1 is 0.2, so the area to the right of -1 is 0.8.Wait, that's interesting. So, both 5 and -1 have cumulative probabilities of 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. Maybe I can use the Z-score formula to find σ.The Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ. For X = 5, the Z-score would be Z = (5 - 2) / σ = 3 / σ. Similarly, for X = -1, the Z-score would be Z = (-1 - 2) / σ = -3 / σ.Now, since P(X > 5) = 0.2, that corresponds to the area to the right of Z = 3 / σ being 0.2. In terms of the standard normal distribution, this means that P(Z > 3 / σ) = 0.2. Similarly, P(X < -1) = 0.2 corresponds to P(Z < -3 / σ) = 0.2.Looking at standard normal distribution tables, the Z-score that corresponds to an area of 0.2 to the right is approximately 0.8416. Wait, let me double-check that. If I look up the Z-score for which the cumulative probability is 0.8, that's the same as the area to the left being 0.8 and to the right being 0.2. Yes, that Z-score is approximately 0.8416.So, 3 / σ = 0.8416. Solving for σ, we get σ = 3 / 0.8416 ≈ 3.564.Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me verify. If σ is approximately 3.564, then the standard deviation is quite large, which would make sense because the distance from the mean to 5 is 3 units, and the standard deviation is about 3.564, so it's just a bit more than one standard deviation away.But wait, let me think again. If the Z-score is 0.8416, that corresponds to about 0.84 standard deviations above the mean. But in our case, the distance from the mean to 5 is 3 units, so 3 units correspond to 0.8416 standard deviations. Therefore, σ = 3 / 0.8416 ≈ 3.564. Yeah, that seems correct.Now that I have σ ≈ 3.564, I can find the probability P(2 < X < 5). Since 2 is the mean, the probability from the mean to 5 is the same as the area under the curve from μ to 5. In terms of Z-scores, that would be from Z = 0 to Z = (5 - 2)/σ ≈ 3 / 3.564 ≈ 0.8416.Looking at the standard normal distribution table, the area from Z = 0 to Z = 0.8416 is approximately 0.2995. So, P(2 < X < 5) ≈ 0.2995, which is roughly 0.3.Wait, but earlier I thought about the symmetry of the distribution. Since P(X > 5) = 0.2 and P(X < -1) = 0.2, the total area in the tails is 0.4, so the area in the middle is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Since the distribution is symmetric around μ = 2, the area from -1 to 5 is 0.6, which is split equally on both sides of the mean. Therefore, the area from 2 to 5 should be half of 0.6, which is 0.3. That matches my earlier calculation.So, both methods give me the same result. Therefore, P(2 < X < 5) = 0.3.I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I found the mean by taking the average of 5 and -1, which gave me μ = 2. Then, using the given probabilities, I found the standard deviation σ ≈ 3.564. Using the Z-score, I calculated the area from μ to 5, which was approximately 0.3. Additionally, by considering the symmetry and total area under the curve, I confirmed that the area from 2 to 5 is indeed 0.3. So, I'm confident that the answer is 0.3."},{"question":"The monotonic increasing interval of the function y= sqrt {-x^{2}-2x+8} is ______ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this function here: ( y = sqrt{-x^2 - 2x + 8} ). I need to find the interval where this function is monotonically increasing. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, since it's a square root function, the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative. So, I should start by figuring out the domain of this function. That means solving the inequality:[-x^2 - 2x + 8 geq 0]Hmm, let's rewrite this to make it easier to handle. If I multiply both sides by -1, the inequality sign will flip:[x^2 + 2x - 8 leq 0]Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. To do that, I can factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add up to 2. Hmm, 4 and -2? Yes, because 4 * (-2) = -8 and 4 + (-2) = 2. So, the factored form is:[(x + 4)(x - 2) leq 0]Okay, so the critical points are x = -4 and x = 2. To find where the quadratic is less than or equal to zero, I can test intervals around these critical points.- For ( x < -4 ), say x = -5: ( (-5 + 4)(-5 - 2) = (-1)(-7) = 7 ) which is positive.- For ( -4 < x < 2 ), say x = 0: ( (0 + 4)(0 - 2) = 4 * (-2) = -8 ) which is negative.- For ( x > 2 ), say x = 3: ( (3 + 4)(3 - 2) = 7 * 1 = 7 ) which is positive.Since the inequality is ( leq 0 ), the solution is where the quadratic is negative or zero, which is between -4 and 2, including the endpoints. So, the domain of the function is ( [-4, 2] ).Alright, now that I have the domain, I need to figure out where the function ( y = sqrt{-x^2 - 2x + 8} ) is increasing. Since this is a composite function, it's helpful to break it down into inner and outer functions.Let me let ( t = -x^2 - 2x + 8 ). Then, the function becomes ( y = sqrt{t} ). Now, the outer function is ( y = sqrt{t} ), which is a square root function. I know that the square root function is increasing for ( t geq 0 ). So, if the inner function ( t ) is increasing, then the entire composite function ( y ) will also be increasing. Conversely, if ( t ) is decreasing, then ( y ) will be decreasing.Therefore, to find where ( y ) is increasing, I need to find where ( t ) is increasing within the domain ( [-4, 2] ).So, let's analyze the inner function ( t = -x^2 - 2x + 8 ). This is a quadratic function, and since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative (-1), it's a downward-opening parabola. The graph of this function will have a maximum point at its vertex.To find the vertex of a quadratic function ( ax^2 + bx + c ), the x-coordinate is given by ( -frac{b}{2a} ). In this case, ( a = -1 ) and ( b = -2 ), so:[x = -frac{-2}{2 * (-1)} = -frac{-2}{-2} = 1]Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check that. The formula is ( -frac{b}{2a} ), so plugging in:[x = -frac{-2}{2 * (-1)} = frac{2}{-2} = -1]Ah, okay, so the vertex is at ( x = -1 ). Since the parabola opens downward, the function ( t ) increases to the left of the vertex and decreases to the right of the vertex.So, the function ( t = -x^2 - 2x + 8 ) is increasing on the interval ( [-4, -1] ) and decreasing on ( [-1, 2] ).Since the outer function ( y = sqrt{t} ) is increasing, the composite function ( y ) will be increasing wherever ( t ) is increasing. Therefore, the interval where ( y ) is increasing is ( [-4, -1] ).Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything:1. Found the domain by solving ( -x^2 - 2x + 8 geq 0 ), which gave ( [-4, 2] ).2. Expressed the function as a composite function ( y = sqrt{t} ) where ( t = -x^2 - 2x + 8 ).3. Determined that ( t ) is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at ( x = -1 ).4. Concluded that ( t ) is increasing on ( [-4, -1] ) and decreasing on ( [-1, 2] ).5. Since ( y = sqrt{t} ) is increasing, the composite function ( y ) is increasing on ( [-4, -1] ).I think that covers all the steps. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the interval ( [-4, -1] ) is where the function is monotonically increasing.**Final Answer**The monotonic increasing interval of the function is boxed{[-4, -1]}."},{"question":"Determine which of the following statements is true for the graph of the power function y = x^n for any real number n:A: It always passes through the point (0,0).B: It always passes through the point (-1,-1).C: It always passes through the point (-1,1).D: It always passes through the point (1,1).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about power functions, specifically the graph of y equals x to the power of n, where n is any real number. I need to figure out which of the given statements is always true for this graph. The options are A, B, C, and D, each stating that the graph passes through a specific point: (0,0), (-1,-1), (-1,1), or (1,1).First, let me recall what a power function is. A power function is of the form y = x^n, where n is a real number. Depending on the value of n, the graph can take different shapes. For example, if n is a positive integer, it's a polynomial function, and if n is a negative integer, it's a reciprocal function. If n is a fraction, it might be a root function, and so on. But regardless of what n is, the function is still y = x^n.Now, I need to check each of the given points to see if the graph of y = x^n always passes through them for any real number n.Starting with option A: It always passes through the point (0,0). Hmm, let's think about this. If I plug in x = 0 into the function, I get y = 0^n. Now, 0 raised to any positive exponent is 0, so for n > 0, y = 0. But what if n is 0? Then y = 0^0, which is undefined. And if n is negative, like n = -1, then y = 0^-1, which is 1/0, which is also undefined. So, for n = 0 or any negative number, the function isn't defined at x = 0. Therefore, the graph doesn't always pass through (0,0) because it's undefined for some values of n. So, option A is not always true.Moving on to option B: It always passes through the point (-1,-1). Let's test this. If I plug in x = -1, then y = (-1)^n. Now, if n is an even integer, (-1)^n would be 1, and if n is an odd integer, it would be -1. But n can be any real number, not just integers. For example, if n is 1/2, then (-1)^(1/2) is the square root of -1, which is an imaginary number, not a real number. Since we're dealing with real functions, the graph wouldn't pass through (-1,-1) in this case because y would be undefined. Similarly, for other non-integer exponents, we might get complex numbers or undefined results. Therefore, the graph doesn't always pass through (-1,-1) for any real number n. So, option B is not always true.Next is option C: It always passes through the point (-1,1). Similar to option B, let's plug in x = -1. We get y = (-1)^n. As before, if n is even, y = 1, which would pass through (-1,1). But if n is odd, y = -1, which doesn't pass through (-1,1). Also, for non-integer exponents, y might not be a real number at all, as in the case of n = 1/2. So, just like with option B, the graph doesn't always pass through (-1,1) because it depends on the value of n and might not even be a real number for some exponents. Therefore, option C is not always true.Finally, option D: It always passes through the point (1,1). Let's check this. If I plug in x = 1, then y = 1^n. Regardless of what n is, 1 raised to any power is always 1. So, whether n is positive, negative, zero, an integer, a fraction, or any real number, 1^n is always 1. This means that the graph of y = x^n will always pass through the point (1,1) no matter what value n takes. Therefore, option D is always true.To summarize, after evaluating each option:- Option A is not always true because the function isn't defined at x = 0 for n ≤ 0.- Option B is not always true because the result depends on whether n is even or odd and might not even be a real number for some exponents.- Option C is not always true for the same reasons as option B.- Option D is always true because 1 raised to any power is always 1.So, the correct answer is option D."},{"question":"The number 0.6375 can be written as a fraction frac{a}{b} for positive integers a and b. When this fraction is in simplest terms, what is a+b?","answer":"I need to convert the decimal number 0.6375 into a fraction. To do this, I'll start by expressing 0.6375 as a fraction over 10000, which gives me 6375/10000.Next, I need to simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6375 and 10000. I'll begin by factoring both numbers into their prime factors.Starting with 6375, I notice it ends with a 5, so it's divisible by 5. Dividing 6375 by 5 gives me 1275. I continue dividing by 5 again to get 255, and once more to obtain 51. Now, 51 is divisible by 3, resulting in 17, which is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 6375 are 5³ × 3 × 17.For 10000, since it's 10⁴, the prime factors are 2⁴ × 5⁴.The common prime factors between 6375 and 10000 are 5³. I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5³, which is 125, to simplify the fraction. This gives me 51/80.Now, I check if 51 and 80 have any common factors other than 1. Since 51 is 3 × 17 and 80 is 2⁴ × 5, they don't share any common factors besides 1. Therefore, the fraction 51/80 is in its simplest form.Finally, I add the numerator and the denominator to find the sum: 51 + 80 = 131."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the sum of distances from point P to points F_1(0, -sqrt{3}) and F_2(0, sqrt{3}) is equal to 4.

For what value of k is |vec{OA} + vec{OB}| = |vec{AB}| (where O is the origin)? What is the value of |vec{AB}| at this time?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about the Cartesian coordinate system. Let me try to understand it step by step.First, part (1) says that the sum of distances from point P to two fixed points F1(0, -√3) and F2(0, √3) is equal to 4. Hmm, I remember that the set of all points where the sum of the distances to two fixed points is constant is called an ellipse. So, the trajectory of point P is an ellipse with foci at F1 and F2.Okay, so I need to find the equation of this ellipse. The standard form of an ellipse is (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, where a is the semi-major axis, b is the semi-minor axis, and the distance between the center and each focus is c, with c² = a² - b².Given that the sum of the distances is 4, that should be equal to 2a, right? So, 2a = 4, which means a = 2. The distance between the foci is 2c, and since the foci are at (0, -√3) and (0, √3), the distance between them is 2√3, so c = √3.Now, using the relationship c² = a² - b², I can plug in the known values. So, (√3)² = 2² - b². That simplifies to 3 = 4 - b², so b² = 1, which means b = 1.Therefore, the equation of the ellipse should be (x²/4) + y² = 1. Let me double-check that. If a = 2, then x² term is divided by 4, and y² term is divided by 1, which is just y². Yeah, that seems right.Moving on to part (2). We have a line l: y = kx + 1 intersecting the ellipse C at points A and B. We need to find the value of k such that the magnitude of vector OA + vector OB is equal to the magnitude of vector AB. Also, we need to find the value of |AB| at that time.First, let's parse what |OA + OB| = |AB| means. Vector OA is the position vector of point A, and vector OB is the position vector of point B. So, OA + OB is the vector from the origin to the point (x1 + x2, y1 + y2), where A is (x1, y1) and B is (x2, y2). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt[(x1 + x2)² + (y1 + y2)²].On the other hand, vector AB is the vector from A to B, which is (x2 - x1, y2 - y1). The magnitude of AB is sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²].So, we have sqrt[(x1 + x2)² + (y1 + y2)²] = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²].If I square both sides to eliminate the square roots, I get:(x1 + x2)² + (y1 + y2)² = (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)².Let me expand both sides:Left side: (x1² + 2x1x2 + x2²) + (y1² + 2y1y2 + y2²)Right side: (x2² - 2x1x2 + x1²) + (y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²)Simplify both sides:Left side: x1² + x2² + y1² + y2² + 2x1x2 + 2y1y2Right side: x1² + x2² + y1² + y2² - 2x1x2 - 2y1y2Subtract the right side from the left side:(Left side) - (Right side) = 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0So, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0, which simplifies to x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.Therefore, the condition |OA + OB| = |AB| is equivalent to x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.Alright, so I need to find the value of k such that when the line y = kx + 1 intersects the ellipse (x²/4) + y² = 1, the product of the x-coordinates of points A and B plus the product of the y-coordinates of points A and B is zero.To find x1x2 and y1y2, I can use the equations of the line and the ellipse. Let's substitute y = kx + 1 into the ellipse equation:(x²)/4 + (kx + 1)² = 1Expanding that:(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx + 1 = 1Simplify:(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx + 1 - 1 = 0So,(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx = 0Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:x² + 4k²x² + 8kx = 0Combine like terms:(1 + 4k²)x² + 8kx = 0Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my substitution again.Original ellipse equation: (x²)/4 + y² = 1Substitute y = kx + 1:(x²)/4 + (kx + 1)² = 1Expand (kx + 1)²: k²x² + 2kx + 1So, equation becomes:(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx + 1 = 1Subtract 1 from both sides:(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx = 0Multiply through by 4:x² + 4k²x² + 8kx = 0Factor x:x(1 + 4k²)x + 8k = 0Wait, that doesn't seem correct. Let me re-express:After multiplying by 4:x² + 4k²x² + 8kx = 0Combine x² terms:(1 + 4k²)x² + 8kx = 0Factor x:x[(1 + 4k²)x + 8k] = 0So, the solutions are x = 0 or (1 + 4k²)x + 8k = 0 => x = -8k / (1 + 4k²)But wait, that would mean that the line intersects the ellipse at x = 0 and x = -8k / (1 + 4k²). But that would only give two points, but in reality, a line can intersect an ellipse at two points, so I must have made a mistake in my algebra.Wait, let me go back.Original substitution:(x²)/4 + (kx + 1)² = 1Expand (kx + 1)²: k²x² + 2kx + 1So,(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx + 1 = 1Subtract 1:(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx = 0Multiply by 4:x² + 4k²x² + 8kx = 0Combine x² terms:(1 + 4k²)x² + 8kx = 0Factor:x[(1 + 4k²)x + 8k] = 0So, x = 0 or x = -8k / (1 + 4k²)But if x = 0, then y = k*0 + 1 = 1. So, one point is (0, 1). The other point is x = -8k / (1 + 4k²), and y = k*(-8k / (1 + 4k²)) + 1 = (-8k²)/(1 + 4k²) + 1 = (-8k² + 1 + 4k²)/(1 + 4k²) = (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²)So, points A and B are (0, 1) and (-8k/(1 + 4k²), (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²))Wait, but that would mean that the line intersects the ellipse at two points, one of which is (0,1), which is fixed, and the other varies with k.But in the problem statement, it says the line intersects the curve C at points A and B. So, if one of the points is always (0,1), then A and B are (0,1) and the other point.But in that case, the condition |OA + OB| = |AB| would involve vectors OA and OB, where one of them is (0,1) and the other is the varying point.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I should set up the equation correctly.Given the ellipse (x²)/4 + y² = 1 and the line y = kx + 1.Substitute y into the ellipse:(x²)/4 + (kx + 1)^2 = 1Expand (kx + 1)^2: k²x² + 2kx + 1So,(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx + 1 = 1Subtract 1:(x²)/4 + k²x² + 2kx = 0Multiply by 4:x² + 4k²x² + 8kx = 0Combine terms:(1 + 4k²)x² + 8kx = 0Factor:x[(1 + 4k²)x + 8k] = 0So, solutions are x = 0 and x = -8k / (1 + 4k²)So, points A and B are (0,1) and (-8k/(1 + 4k²), (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²))Wait, but if that's the case, then OA is (0,1) and OB is (-8k/(1 + 4k²), (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²))So, OA + OB would be ( -8k/(1 + 4k²), 1 + (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²) )Simplify the y-component:1 + (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²) = (1 + 4k² + 1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²) = 2/(1 + 4k²)So, OA + OB is ( -8k/(1 + 4k²), 2/(1 + 4k²) )The magnitude of OA + OB is sqrt[ ( -8k/(1 + 4k²) )² + ( 2/(1 + 4k²) )² ]Which is sqrt[ 64k²/(1 + 4k²)^2 + 4/(1 + 4k²)^2 ] = sqrt[ (64k² + 4)/(1 + 4k²)^2 ] = sqrt(64k² + 4)/(1 + 4k²)Similarly, vector AB is OB - OA, since OA is (0,1) and OB is (-8k/(1 + 4k²), (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²))So, AB = ( -8k/(1 + 4k²) - 0, (1 - 4k²)/(1 + 4k²) - 1 ) = ( -8k/(1 + 4k²), (1 - 4k² - (1 + 4k²))/(1 + 4k²) ) = ( -8k/(1 + 4k²), (-8k²)/(1 + 4k²) )So, the magnitude of AB is sqrt[ ( -8k/(1 + 4k²) )² + ( -8k²/(1 + 4k²) )² ] = sqrt[ 64k²/(1 + 4k²)^2 + 64k^4/(1 + 4k²)^2 ] = sqrt[ (64k² + 64k^4)/(1 + 4k²)^2 ] = sqrt[64k²(1 + k²)/(1 + 4k²)^2] = 8k sqrt(1 + k²)/(1 + 4k²)So, we have |OA + OB| = sqrt(64k² + 4)/(1 + 4k²) and |AB| = 8k sqrt(1 + k²)/(1 + 4k²)We need to set these equal:sqrt(64k² + 4)/(1 + 4k²) = 8k sqrt(1 + k²)/(1 + 4k²)Since denominators are the same, we can equate numerators:sqrt(64k² + 4) = 8k sqrt(1 + k²)Square both sides:64k² + 4 = 64k²(1 + k²)Simplify:64k² + 4 = 64k² + 64k^4Subtract 64k² from both sides:4 = 64k^4Divide both sides by 4:1 = 16k^4So, k^4 = 1/16Take fourth root:k = ± (1/16)^(1/4) = ± (1/2)So, k = ±1/2Now, let's find |AB| when k = 1/2 or k = -1/2.Using the expression for |AB|:|AB| = 8k sqrt(1 + k²)/(1 + 4k²)Let's compute for k = 1/2:First, compute 1 + 4k² = 1 + 4*(1/4) = 1 + 1 = 2Compute sqrt(1 + k²) = sqrt(1 + 1/4) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2So, |AB| = 8*(1/2)*(sqrt(5)/2)/2 = (4)*(sqrt(5)/2)/2 = (2*sqrt(5))/2 = sqrt(5)Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.Wait, |AB| = 8k sqrt(1 + k²)/(1 + 4k²)For k = 1/2:8*(1/2) = 4sqrt(1 + (1/2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1/4) = sqrt(5/4) = sqrt(5)/2Denominator: 1 + 4*(1/2)^2 = 1 + 4*(1/4) = 1 + 1 = 2So, |AB| = 4*(sqrt(5)/2)/2 = (4*sqrt(5)/2)/2 = (2*sqrt(5))/2 = sqrt(5)Wait, but earlier when I thought the answer was 4√65 /17, that's different. Did I make a mistake?Wait, let me check my earlier steps.Wait, when I substituted y = kx +1 into the ellipse, I got (x²)/4 + (kx +1)^2 =1, which expanded to x²/4 + k²x² + 2kx +1 =1, leading to x²/4 + k²x² + 2kx =0, then multiplied by 4: x² +4k²x² +8kx=0, which is (1 +4k²)x² +8kx=0, factoring x: x[(1 +4k²)x +8k]=0, so x=0 or x= -8k/(1 +4k²)So, points are (0,1) and (-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))Then, OA + OB is ( -8k/(1 +4k²), 2/(1 +4k²) )|OA + OB| is sqrt[ (64k² +4)/(1 +4k²)^2 ] = sqrt(64k² +4)/(1 +4k²)|AB| is sqrt[ (64k² +64k^4)/(1 +4k²)^2 ] = 8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)Setting them equal:sqrt(64k² +4) =8k sqrt(1 +k²)Square both sides:64k² +4 =64k²(1 +k²)64k² +4=64k² +64k^4Subtract 64k²:4=64k^4k^4=1/16k=±1/2So, k=±1/2Then, |AB|=8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)For k=1/2:8*(1/2)=4sqrt(1 +1/4)=sqrt(5)/2Denominator:1 +4*(1/4)=2So, |AB|=4*(sqrt(5)/2)/2= (2*sqrt(5))/2= sqrt(5)Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 4√65 /17. That must be incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the line intersects the ellipse at two points, one of which is (0,1). But actually, when I solved the equation, I got x=0 and x=-8k/(1 +4k²). So, the line intersects the ellipse at (0,1) and another point. So, points A and B are (0,1) and (-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))But in the problem statement, it says \\"intersect curve C at points A and B\\". So, if the line intersects the ellipse at two points, which are (0,1) and the other point, then A and B are these two points.But when I computed |OA + OB|, I got sqrt(5) when k=1/2, but I thought the answer was 4√65 /17. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.Wait, let me check the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0.Given that points A and B are (0,1) and (-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))So, x1=0, y1=1x2=-8k/(1 +4k²), y2=(1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²)So, x1x2 + y1y2=0*(-8k/(1 +4k²)) +1*(1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²)= (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²)=0So, 1 -4k²=0 => k²=1/4 =>k=±1/2Which is consistent with our earlier result.So, when k=±1/2, x1x2 + y1y2=0, which is the condition for |OA + OB|=|AB|Therefore, the value of k is ±1/2, and |AB|=sqrt(5)Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 4√65 /17. That must be incorrect.Wait, let me recalculate |AB|.From points A(0,1) and B(-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))So, AB vector is ( -8k/(1 +4k²) -0, (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²) -1 ) = ( -8k/(1 +4k²), (-4k²)/(1 +4k²) )So, |AB|=sqrt[ ( -8k/(1 +4k²) )² + ( -4k²/(1 +4k²) )² ]=sqrt[64k²/(1 +4k²)^2 +16k^4/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=sqrt[ (64k² +16k^4)/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=sqrt[16k²(4 +k²)/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=4k sqrt(4 +k²)/(1 +4k²)Wait, earlier I had 8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²). That was a mistake.So, correct expression is |AB|=4k sqrt(4 +k²)/(1 +4k²)So, for k=1/2:|AB|=4*(1/2)*sqrt(4 +1/4)/(1 +4*(1/4))=2*sqrt(17/4)/2=2*(sqrt(17)/2)/2= sqrt(17)/2Wait, that's different again.Wait, let me compute step by step.For k=1/2:Compute numerator:4k sqrt(4 +k²)=4*(1/2)*sqrt(4 +1/4)=2*sqrt(17/4)=2*(sqrt(17)/2)=sqrt(17)Denominator:1 +4k²=1 +4*(1/4)=1 +1=2So, |AB|=sqrt(17)/2Wait, but earlier when I computed |AB| as sqrt(5), that was incorrect because I made a mistake in the vector AB.Wait, let's recast.Points A(0,1) and B(-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))So, vector AB is ( -8k/(1 +4k²) -0, (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²) -1 )= ( -8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k² - (1 +4k²))/(1 +4k²) )= ( -8k/(1 +4k²), (-8k²)/(1 +4k²) )So, |AB|=sqrt[ ( -8k/(1 +4k²) )² + ( -8k²/(1 +4k²) )² ]=sqrt[64k²/(1 +4k²)^2 +64k^4/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=sqrt[ (64k² +64k^4)/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=sqrt[64k²(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)Wait, so earlier I had 8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²), but in the second calculation, I had 4k sqrt(4 +k²)/(1 +4k²). Which one is correct?Wait, let's compute the components:x-component of AB: -8k/(1 +4k²)y-component of AB: (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²) -1= (1 -4k² -1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²)= (-8k²)/(1 +4k²)So, |AB|=sqrt[ ( -8k/(1 +4k²) )² + ( -8k²/(1 +4k²) )² ]=sqrt[64k²/(1 +4k²)^2 +64k^4/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=sqrt[ (64k² +64k^4)/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=sqrt[64k²(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)^2 ]=8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)So, the correct expression is 8k sqrt(1 +k²)/(1 +4k²)Therefore, for k=1/2:8*(1/2)=4sqrt(1 + (1/2)^2)=sqrt(5/4)=sqrt(5)/2Denominator:1 +4*(1/2)^2=1 +1=2So, |AB|=4*(sqrt(5)/2)/2= (2*sqrt(5))/2= sqrt(5)Wait, but earlier I thought it was sqrt(17)/2. That must be incorrect.Wait, let me compute |AB| again.Wait, when k=1/2:Point B is (-8*(1/2)/(1 +4*(1/2)^2), (1 -4*(1/2)^2)/(1 +4*(1/2)^2))= (-4/(1 +1), (1 -1)/(1 +1))= (-4/2, 0/2)= (-2,0)So, point A is (0,1), point B is (-2,0)So, vector AB is (-2 -0, 0 -1)= (-2, -1)So, |AB|=sqrt[(-2)^2 + (-1)^2]=sqrt[4 +1]=sqrt(5)Yes, that's correct.So, |AB|=sqrt(5) when k=1/2.Similarly, for k=-1/2, point B would be (2,0), and |AB|=sqrt(5) as well.Therefore, the value of k is ±1/2, and |AB|=sqrt(5)Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the answer was given as 4√65 /17. That must be incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the line intersects the ellipse at (0,1) and another point. Maybe the line intersects the ellipse at two distinct points, not necessarily including (0,1). Let me check.Wait, when I solved the equation, I got x=0 and x=-8k/(1 +4k²). So, for k=1/2, x=-8*(1/2)/(1 +4*(1/2)^2)= -4/(1 +1)= -2, which is correct. So, points are (0,1) and (-2,0). Similarly, for k=-1/2, points are (0,1) and (2,0).But in the problem statement, it says \\"intersect curve C at points A and B\\". So, A and B are these two points.But when I computed |AB|, I got sqrt(5), which is correct.Wait, but in the initial problem, the answer was given as 4√65 /17. That must be incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition x1x2 + y1y2=0. Let me check.Given points A(x1,y1) and B(x2,y2), the condition |OA + OB|=|AB| translates to x1x2 + y1y2=0.But in our case, points A and B are (0,1) and (-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))So, x1x2 + y1y2=0*(-8k/(1 +4k²)) +1*(1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²)= (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²)=0Thus, 1 -4k²=0 =>k²=1/4 =>k=±1/2So, that's correct.Therefore, the value of k is ±1/2, and |AB|=sqrt(5)So, the final answer is k=±1/2 and |AB|=sqrt(5)But in the initial problem, the answer was given as 4√65 /17. That must be incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution.Wait, let me try solving the equation again.Given ellipse: x²/4 + y²=1Line: y=kx +1Substitute y into ellipse:x²/4 + (kx +1)^2=1Expand:x²/4 +k²x² +2kx +1=1Subtract 1:x²/4 +k²x² +2kx=0Multiply by 4:x² +4k²x² +8kx=0Combine terms:(1 +4k²)x² +8kx=0Factor:x[(1 +4k²)x +8k]=0Solutions: x=0 or x=-8k/(1 +4k²)So, points are (0,1) and (-8k/(1 +4k²), (1 -4k²)/(1 +4k²))Thus, points A and B are these two points.Therefore, when k=1/2, point B is (-2,0), and |AB|=sqrt(5)Similarly, for k=-1/2, point B is (2,0), and |AB|=sqrt(5)So, the correct answer is k=±1/2 and |AB|=sqrt(5)Therefore, the initial answer of 4√65 /17 must be incorrect.Wait, perhaps the problem was intended to have two distinct points other than (0,1). Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that one of the points is always (0,1). Let me check.Wait, when I solved the equation, I got x=0 and x=-8k/(1 +4k²). So, for k=1/2, x=-2, which is correct. So, the line intersects the ellipse at (0,1) and (-2,0). So, points A and B are (0,1) and (-2,0). So, |AB|=sqrt(5)Therefore, the correct answer is k=±1/2 and |AB|=sqrt(5)So, the initial answer of 4√65 /17 must be incorrect.Therefore, the final answer is k=±1/2 and |AB|=sqrt(5)"},{"question":"If point P (2a+1, -3a) is symmetric to point P_1 (1, 3-b) with respect to the x-axis, then b^a =  .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Point P is given as (2a + 1, -3a), and it's symmetric to point P₁, which is (1, 3 - b), with respect to the x-axis. I need to find b raised to the power of a, which is b^a. Hmm, symmetry with respect to the x-axis... I remember that when two points are symmetric about the x-axis, their x-coordinates are the same, and their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. Let me try to apply that here.First, let's write down what we know. Point P is (2a + 1, -3a), and point P₁ is (1, 3 - b). Since they are symmetric about the x-axis, their x-coordinates must be equal. So, that gives me the equation:2a + 1 = 1Okay, let's solve for a. Subtract 1 from both sides:2a + 1 - 1 = 1 - 1Simplifies to:2a = 0Divide both sides by 2:a = 0Alright, so a is 0. Now, moving on to the y-coordinates. Since they are symmetric about the x-axis, the y-coordinate of P should be the negative of the y-coordinate of P₁. So, that gives me:-3a = -(3 - b)Let me substitute the value of a we found into this equation. Since a is 0:-3(0) = -(3 - b)Simplifies to:0 = -(3 - b)Multiply both sides by -1 to eliminate the negative sign:0 = 3 - bNow, solve for b. Subtract 3 from both sides:0 - 3 = 3 - b - 3Which simplifies to:-3 = -bMultiply both sides by -1:3 = bSo, b is 3. Now, the problem asks for b^a. We have b = 3 and a = 0, so:b^a = 3^0I remember that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so:3^0 = 1Therefore, b^a is 1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the x-coordinates: 2a + 1 = 1. Solving for a gives a = 0. Then, for the y-coordinates: -3a = -(3 - b). Substituting a = 0 gives 0 = -(3 - b), which simplifies to 3 - b = 0, so b = 3. Then, b^a is 3^0, which is indeed 1. Yeah, that seems correct.I guess another way to think about it is, if a is 0, then point P becomes (2*0 + 1, -3*0) = (1, 0). Point P₁ is (1, 3 - b). Since they are symmetric about the x-axis, P₁ should be (1, -0) which is (1, 0). So, 3 - b must equal 0, which again gives b = 3. So, yeah, that checks out.I think I'm confident with this answer.

Determine x if (49, 16, x, 2) is a Modified O'Hara Triple.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about something called a Modified O'Hara Triple. It involves four positive integers: a, b, x, and k. The definition says that (a, b, x, k) is a Modified O'Hara Triple if the equation k times the square root of a plus the square root of b equals x. They gave an example: (1, 4, 5, 2) is a Modified O'Hara Triple because 2 times the square root of 1 plus the square root of 4 equals 5. Let me check that: 2*1 + 2 = 4, which is not 5. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I did something wrong. Hmm, no, wait, the square root of 4 is 2, so 2*1 + 2 is indeed 4, but they said it's 5. Maybe I misread the example. Let me look again. Oh, maybe it's 2*sqrt(1) + sqrt(4) which is 2*1 + 2, which is 4, but they said it's 5. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the example is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition. Wait, maybe the example is correct, and I'm just miscalculating. Let me double-check: sqrt(1) is 1, so 2*1 is 2, and sqrt(4) is 2, so 2 + 2 is 4, not 5. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something. Well, maybe it's a typo, and the example should be (1, 9, 5, 2) because 2*1 + 3 is 5. That would make sense. But regardless, I need to focus on the problem at hand.The problem is asking me to determine x if (49, 16, x, 2) is a Modified O'Hara Triple. So, according to the definition, I need to plug in a=49, b=16, and k=2 into the equation k*sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) = x.Let me write that out step by step. First, I need to find the square roots of a and b. The square root of 49 is 7 because 7*7 is 49. The square root of 16 is 4 because 4*4 is 16. So now, plugging these into the equation: k*sqrt(a) is 2*7, which is 14, and sqrt(b) is 4. So adding those together, 14 + 4 equals 18. Therefore, x should be 18.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Square root of 49 is definitely 7, and square root of 16 is 4. Multiplying 2 by 7 gives 14, and adding 4 gives 18. Yeah, that seems straightforward. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, x is 18.Just to double-check, let me plug the numbers back into the original equation to verify. 2*sqrt(49) is 2*7, which is 14, and sqrt(16) is 4. Adding them together, 14 + 4 is indeed 18. So, x equals 18. That makes sense.I guess the example they gave might have been a typo or something, but in this case, the calculation seems clear. I don't see any other way to interpret the problem.

Hmm, let's see. I need to calculate this step by step. First, I remember that exponents mean multiplying the base by itself a certain number of times. So, (3^2) is 3 multiplied by 3, and (7^2) is 7 multiplied by 7. Let me write that down:- (3^2 = 3 times 3 = 9)- (7^2 = 7 times 7 = 49)Alright, so now I can rewrite the original expression with these values:(9 times 4 times 49 times 11)Hmm, maybe I can multiply some of these numbers together to make it easier. Let me see. I know that 9 times 4 is 36, right? So, (9 times 4 = 36). Now the expression looks like (36 times 49 times 11).Okay, next step. I need to multiply 36 by 49. Hmm, 36 times 50 would be easier because 50 is a nice round number. But since it's 49, which is one less than 50, maybe I can adjust for that. So, 36 times 50 is 1800, and then subtract 36 to account for the extra 1 in 50. Let me do that:- (36 times 50 = 1800)- Subtract 36: (1800 - 36 = 1764)So, (36 times 49 = 1764). Now the expression is (1764 times 11). Multiplying by 11 can be tricky, but I remember a trick where you can add the digits of the number and place the sum in between. Wait, does that work for all numbers? Let me try it with 1764. So, 1764 times 11. Let's break it down:- The first digit is 1.- The next digits are 7, 6, and 4.- So, adding the digits: 1 + 7 = 8, 7 + 6 = 13, 6 + 4 = 10.- Hmm, that seems complicated because of the carries. Maybe I should just multiply it the standard way.Let's do it step by step:- Multiply 1764 by 10: (1764 times 10 = 17640)- Then add 1764: (17640 + 1764 = 19404)So, (1764 times 11 = 19404). Putting it all together:- (3^2 = 9)- (7^2 = 49)- (9 times 4 = 36)- (36 times 49 = 1764)- (1764 times 11 = 19404)Therefore, the value of (3^2 times 4 times 7^2 times 11) is 19,404. I think that's the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, (3^2) is definitely 9. (7^2) is 49. Multiplying 9 by 4 gives 36. Then, 36 times 49—I did 36 times 50 minus 36, which is 1764. That seems right. Finally, multiplying 1764 by 11, I broke it down into 1764 times 10 plus 1764, which is 17640 plus 1764, totaling 19404.

Hmm, tangents and circles... I remember that for a line to be tangent to a circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. That sounds right.First, I think I should rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form so I can easily identify its center and radius. The given equation is ( x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 2 = 0 ). Let me complete the square for the ( x )-terms.So, starting with ( x^2 - 2x ), I can rewrite this as ( (x - 1)^2 - 1 ) because ( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 ), so I have to subtract 1 to keep the equation balanced. Then, the equation becomes:( (x - 1)^2 - 1 + y^2 - 2 = 0 )Simplifying that, I get:( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0 )Which means:( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 3 )Okay, so the circle has center at ( (1, 0) ) and radius ( sqrt{3} ). Got that down.Now, the line is given by ( sqrt{3}x - y + m = 0 ). I need to find ( m ) such that this line is tangent to the circle. As I thought earlier, the distance from the center of the circle to the line should be equal to the radius.The formula for the distance ( d ) from a point ( (x_1, y_1) ) to the line ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) is:( d = frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} )In this case, the center of the circle is ( (1, 0) ), and the line is ( sqrt{3}x - y + m = 0 ). So, let me plug these into the distance formula.Here, ( A = sqrt{3} ), ( B = -1 ), and ( C = m ). The point ( (x_1, y_1) ) is ( (1, 0) ). Plugging these into the formula:( d = frac{|sqrt{3}(1) + (-1)(0) + m|}{sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2}} )Simplifying the numerator:( |sqrt{3} + 0 + m| = |sqrt{3} + m| )And the denominator:( sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{3 + 1} = sqrt{4} = 2 )So, the distance ( d ) is:( d = frac{|sqrt{3} + m|}{2} )Since the line is tangent to the circle, this distance must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is ( sqrt{3} ). Therefore, we set up the equation:( frac{|sqrt{3} + m|}{2} = sqrt{3} )To solve for ( m ), I'll multiply both sides by 2:( |sqrt{3} + m| = 2sqrt{3} )This absolute value equation splits into two cases:1. ( sqrt{3} + m = 2sqrt{3} )2. ( sqrt{3} + m = -2sqrt{3} )Let's solve each case separately.**Case 1:**( sqrt{3} + m = 2sqrt{3} )Subtract ( sqrt{3} ) from both sides:( m = 2sqrt{3} - sqrt{3} )Simplify:( m = sqrt{3} )**Case 2:**( sqrt{3} + m = -2sqrt{3} )Subtract ( sqrt{3} ) from both sides:( m = -2sqrt{3} - sqrt{3} )Simplify:( m = -3sqrt{3} )So, the two possible values for ( m ) are ( sqrt{3} ) and ( -3sqrt{3} ).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the distance formula, plugging in the center (1,0) into the line equation, that's correct. The distance is set equal to the radius, which is ( sqrt{3} ). Then, solving the absolute value equation, both cases seem right. So, yes, ( m ) can be either ( sqrt{3} ) or ( -3sqrt{3} ).Looking back at the options provided:A. ( sqrt{3} ) or ( -sqrt{3} )B. ( -sqrt{3} ) or ( 3sqrt{3} )C. ( -3sqrt{3} ) or ( 3sqrt{3} )D. ( -3sqrt{3} ) or ( sqrt{3} )So, the correct answer is D, which lists ( -3sqrt{3} ) or ( sqrt{3} ).

The first one is ( y = 2x^2 - 1 ) and the second one is ( v = operatorname{cosec} x ). Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what continuity means. A function is continuous at a point if the limit as you approach that point equals the function's value at that point. If it's continuous at every point in its domain, then it's continuous throughout its domain.Starting with the first function, ( y = 2x^2 - 1 ). This looks like a quadratic function, which is a polynomial. I remember that polynomials are continuous everywhere on their domain, which is all real numbers. So, does that mean ( y = 2x^2 - 1 ) is continuous for all real numbers? I think so, but maybe I should double-check.Let me think about the definition of continuity. For any point ( x = a ), the limit as ( x ) approaches ( a ) should equal ( f(a) ). So, for ( f(x) = 2x^2 - 1 ), let's pick an arbitrary point ( a ). Then,[lim_{x to a} f(x) = lim_{x to a} (2x^2 - 1) = 2a^2 - 1 = f(a)]Yeah, that seems to work out. So, since this holds for any real number ( a ), the function is continuous everywhere. Okay, that wasn't too bad.Now, moving on to the second function, ( v = operatorname{cosec} x ). Wait, cosec is the same as cosecant, right? Which is ( frac{1}{sin x} ). So, ( v = frac{1}{sin x} ). I know that sine is continuous everywhere, but cosecant is its reciprocal. So, where is cosecant defined? It's defined wherever sine is not zero, because you can't divide by zero.So, the domain of ( v = operatorname{cosec} x ) is all real numbers except where ( sin x = 0 ). That happens at multiples of ( pi ), so ( x neq kpi ) for any integer ( k ). So, the domain is ( mathbb{R} setminus { kpi | k in mathbb{Z} } ).Now, I need to show that ( v = operatorname{cosec} x ) is continuous on its entire domain. Since it's the reciprocal of sine, and sine is continuous, then as long as we're not dividing by zero, the reciprocal should also be continuous. But maybe I should verify this more carefully.Let me recall that if ( f(x) ) is continuous at a point and ( f(a) neq 0 ), then ( frac{1}{f(x)} ) is also continuous at that point. Since ( sin x ) is continuous everywhere and ( sin a neq 0 ) for ( a ) not equal to ( kpi ), then ( operatorname{cosec} x ) should be continuous at those points.To be thorough, let's use the definition of continuity. For a point ( a ) in the domain of ( v ), which means ( sin a neq 0 ), we need to show that[lim_{x to a} operatorname{cosec} x = operatorname{cosec} a]Which is the same as[lim_{x to a} frac{1}{sin x} = frac{1}{sin a}]Since ( sin x ) is continuous, we can interchange the limit and the reciprocal:[frac{1}{lim_{x to a} sin x} = frac{1}{sin a}]Therefore, the limit equals the function value, so ( operatorname{cosec} x ) is continuous at every point in its domain.Wait, but I should also consider the behavior near the points where ( sin x = 0 ). For example, as ( x ) approaches ( 0 ), ( operatorname{cosec} x ) goes to infinity. But since ( x = 0 ) is not in the domain, we don't have to worry about continuity there. Similarly, near other multiples of ( pi ), the function tends to infinity or negative infinity, but again, those points are excluded from the domain.So, within the domain where ( sin x ) is not zero, ( operatorname{cosec} x ) behaves nicely and doesn't have any jumps or breaks. It's just the reciprocal of a continuous function that doesn't cross zero in those intervals.Hmm, I think that covers it. Both functions are continuous throughout their entire domains because the first is a polynomial and the second is a reciprocal of a sine function, which is continuous where it's defined.Just to recap:1. ( y = 2x^2 - 1 ) is a polynomial, so it's continuous everywhere on ( mathbb{R} ).2. ( v = operatorname{cosec} x ) is the reciprocal of ( sin x ), which is continuous wherever ( sin x neq 0 ), so it's continuous on its domain ( mathbb{R} setminus { kpi | k in mathbb{Z} } ).Therefore, both functions are continuous throughout their respective domains.**Final Answer**Both functions are continuous throughout their entire domains, so the final answers are:1. (boxed{y = 2x^2 - 1}) is continuous for all real numbers.2. (boxed{v = operatorname{cosec} x}) is continuous for all (x) except integer multiples of (pi).**Final Answer**The functions are continuous throughout their entire domains: (boxed{y = 2x^2 - 1}) and (boxed{v = operatorname{cosec} x})."},{"question":"Sunshine Car Rentals rents a basic car at a daily rate of 17.99 dollars plus 0.18 per mile. City Rentals rents a basic car at 18.95 dollars plus a certain amount per mile. The cost is the same for 48.0 miles. What is the cost per mile for City Rentals?","answer":"First, I need to determine the cost per mile for City Rentals. I know that the total cost for renting a car from both companies is the same for 48 miles.I'll start by calculating the total cost from Sunshine Car Rentals for 48 miles. The daily rate is 17.99, and the cost per mile is 0.18. So, the total cost is:17.99 + (0.18 × 48) = 17.99 + 8.64 = 26.63 dollars.Next, I'll set up an equation for City Rentals. Let ( x ) be the cost per mile. The total cost for City Rentals is:18.95 + (x × 48).Since the total costs are equal, I can set the two expressions equal to each other:26.63 = 18.95 + 48x.To solve for ( x ), I'll subtract 18.95 from both sides:26.63 - 18.95 = 48x,which simplifies to:7.68 = 48x.Finally, I'll divide both sides by 48 to find ( x ):x = 7.68 / 48 = 0.16.Therefore, the cost per mile for City Rentals is 0.16."},{"question":"Sally had 39 baseball cards , and 9 were torn .

The options are given as A, B, C, and D, which are different linear equations. I need to figure out which one is the correct tangent line.First, I remember that to find the equation of a tangent line to a function at a specific point, I need two things: the slope of the tangent line at that point and a point through which the tangent line passes. Once I have these two pieces of information, I can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the tangent.So, let's start by finding the slope of the tangent line at ( x = 1 ). The slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve is given by the derivative of the function evaluated at that point. That means I need to find ( f'(x) ) and then plug in ( x = 1 ) into the derivative.The function is ( f(x) = x^4 - x^2 + 1 ). To find its derivative, I can use the power rule, which states that the derivative of ( x^n ) is ( n x^{n-1} ). Applying this rule term by term:- The derivative of ( x^4 ) is ( 4x^3 ).- The derivative of ( -x^2 ) is ( -2x ).- The derivative of the constant term ( 1 ) is ( 0 ).So, putting it all together, the derivative ( f'(x) ) is:[ f'(x) = 4x^3 - 2x ]Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at ( x = 1 ) to find the slope of the tangent line at that point.Plugging in ( x = 1 ):[ f'(1) = 4(1)^3 - 2(1) = 4(1) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 ]So, the slope of the tangent line at ( x = 1 ) is 2.Next, I need to find a point through which the tangent line passes. Since the tangent line touches the curve at ( x = 1 ), the point is ( (1, f(1)) ). I need to compute ( f(1) ) to get the y-coordinate.Calculating ( f(1) ):[ f(1) = (1)^4 - (1)^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 ]So, the point is ( (1, 1) ).Now I have both the slope and a point on the tangent line. I can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the tangent. The point-slope form is:[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ]Where ( m ) is the slope and ( (x_1, y_1) ) is the point. Plugging in the values I have:[ y - 1 = 2(x - 1) ]Now, I need to simplify this equation to get it into the slope-intercept form ( y = mx + b ), which is the form of the answer choices.Expanding the right side:[ y - 1 = 2x - 2 ]Now, add 1 to both sides to solve for ( y ):[ y = 2x - 2 + 1 ][ y = 2x - 1 ]So, the equation of the tangent line is ( y = 2x - 1 ).Looking back at the options provided:A: ( y = x + 1 )B: ( y = x - 1 )C: ( y = 2x + 1 )D: ( y = 2x - 1 )The equation I found matches option D. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the derivative:[ f'(x) = 4x^3 - 2x ]At ( x = 1 ):[ f'(1) = 4(1)^3 - 2(1) = 4 - 2 = 2 ]That seems correct.Then, ( f(1) = 1^4 - 1^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 ). That also looks right.Using point-slope:[ y - 1 = 2(x - 1) ][ y = 2x - 2 + 1 ][ y = 2x - 1 ]Yes, that's correct. So, the tangent line is indeed ( y = 2x - 1 ), which is option D.I think I've got it right. The key steps were finding the derivative to get the slope, evaluating the function to get the point, and then using the point-slope formula to write the equation of the tangent line. It's important to remember to simplify the equation to match the given options, which I did here.Another thing to note is that sometimes people make sign errors when plugging in the values or when simplifying, so it's good to double-check each step. In this case, everything seems consistent.Just to visualize, if I were to graph the function ( f(x) = x^4 - x^2 + 1 ) and the tangent line ( y = 2x - 1 ) at ( x = 1 ), the line should just touch the curve at that point and have the same slope as the curve at that point. Since the slope is 2, it's a fairly steep line, which matches option D.I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that D is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"In the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, find a point C on the z-axis such that the distance from point C to point A (1, 0, 2) and point B (1, 1, 1) is equal.

Hmm, I remember that the reciprocal of a number is like flipping it, right? So if I have a fraction, I just switch the numerator and the denominator. But wait, this number is negative, so does that affect anything?Let me think. The reciprocal of a number ( x ) is defined as ( frac{1}{x} ), right? So if I have (-frac{1}{2022}), then its reciprocal should be ( frac{1}{-frac{1}{2022}} ). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it step by step.First, let's consider the reciprocal without the negative sign. The reciprocal of (frac{1}{2022}) would be (2022), because flipping (frac{1}{2022}) gives (2022/1), which is just 2022. But since the original number is negative, does that mean the reciprocal is also negative? I think so, because if you multiply (-frac{1}{2022}) by (-2022), you should get 1, right?Let me check that. If I multiply (-frac{1}{2022}) by (-2022), that's (-frac{1}{2022} times -2022). The negatives cancel out, so it's (frac{1}{2022} times 2022), which is 1. Yeah, that works. So the reciprocal must be (-2022).Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you take reciprocals, especially with negative numbers, signs can be tricky. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. If I have a negative fraction, like (-frac{a}{b}), then its reciprocal should be (-frac{b}{a}), right? So applying that here, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 2022 ), so the reciprocal would be (-frac{2022}{1}), which is (-2022). That matches what I thought earlier.Just to double-check, let's think about what a reciprocal actually does. It's a number that when multiplied by the original number gives 1. So if I take (-frac{1}{2022}) and multiply it by (-2022), I should get 1. Let's do that:[-frac{1}{2022} times -2022 = left(-frac{1}{2022}right) times (-2022)]Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, so:[frac{1}{2022} times 2022 = 1]Yes, that works out. So the reciprocal is indeed (-2022).I think I'm confident now. The reciprocal of (-frac{1}{2022}) is (-2022), which is option A."},{"question":"If the function y=(log_{frac{1}{2}}a)^x is increasing on the set of real numbers, then the range of values for a is (　　).A: (0, frac{1}{2})  B: (frac{1}{2}, 1)  C: (frac{1}{2}, +infty)  D: (1, +infty)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function y equals (log base 1/2 of a) raised to the power of x is increasing on the set of real numbers. I need to find the range of values for a. The options are A: (0, 1/2), B: (1/2, 1), C: (1/2, infinity), and D: (1, infinity). Hmm, let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with exponential functions of the form b^x, the function is increasing if the base b is greater than 1. If the base b is between 0 and 1, the function is decreasing. So, for y = (log_{1/2} a)^x to be increasing, the base log_{1/2} a must be greater than 1.Wait, but log base 1/2 of a... I need to recall how logarithms with bases less than 1 behave. I remember that log base b of a number c, where 0 < b < 1, is a decreasing function. That means as c increases, log_b c decreases. So, log_{1/2} a is a decreasing function in terms of a.So, if log_{1/2} a > 1, what does that tell me about a? Let me write that down:log_{1/2} a > 1I need to solve for a. To solve a logarithmic inequality, I can rewrite it in exponential form. Remember that log_b c = d is equivalent to b^d = c.So, log_{1/2} a > 1 implies that (1/2)^1 < a. Wait, is that right? Let me think. Since the base is less than 1, the logarithm function is decreasing, so the inequality flips when I exponentiate both sides.Yes, that's correct. So, if log_{1/2} a > 1, then a < (1/2)^1, which is a < 1/2.But also, since the logarithm is only defined for positive numbers, a must be greater than 0. So, combining these two conditions, a must be between 0 and 1/2.Let me double-check that. If a is between 0 and 1/2, then log_{1/2} a would be greater than 1 because, as a decreases, log_{1/2} a increases. For example, if a is 1/4, then log_{1/2} (1/4) is 2, which is greater than 1. Similarly, if a is 1/8, log_{1/2} (1/8) is 3, which is also greater than 1.So, that makes sense. Therefore, the range of a is (0, 1/2), which is option A.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's consider the function y = (log_{1/2} a)^x. If log_{1/2} a is greater than 1, then as x increases, y increases, which is what we want for the function to be increasing.If log_{1/2} a were between 0 and 1, then y would be decreasing because the base is between 0 and 1. If log_{1/2} a were equal to 1, then y would be constant, which isn't increasing. And if log_{1/2} a were negative or zero, the function wouldn't be defined for all real numbers x, especially for negative x if the base is negative.So, yeah, I think I'm confident that a must be between 0 and 1/2. So, the correct answer is A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Among the following four functions, the one that is a decreasing function in the interval (0,1) is (quad)  A: y=log_{2}x  B: y=x^{frac{1}{3}}  C: y=-left( frac{1}{2}right)^{x}  D: y=frac{1}{x}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which of the four given functions is decreasing in the interval (0,1). The options are A, B, C, and D. Let me take each one step by step and analyze their behavior in that interval.Starting with option A: ( y = log_{2}x ). Hmm, I remember that logarithmic functions can be increasing or decreasing depending on their base. Since the base here is 2, which is greater than 1, I think this function is increasing. Let me verify that. The derivative of ( log_{2}x ) with respect to x is ( frac{1}{x ln 2} ). Since ( ln 2 ) is positive and x is in (0,1), the derivative is positive. So yes, this function is increasing in (0,1). That means option A is not the answer we're looking for.Moving on to option B: ( y = x^{frac{1}{3}} ). This is a cube root function. I recall that cube roots are defined for all real numbers, but in the interval (0,1), how does it behave? Let me think about the derivative. The derivative of ( x^{frac{1}{3}} ) is ( frac{1}{3}x^{-frac{2}{3}} ). Since ( x^{-frac{2}{3}} ) is positive for x in (0,1), the derivative is positive. So this function is also increasing in that interval. Therefore, option B is not the decreasing function we're seeking.Next is option C: ( y = -left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ). This looks like an exponential function with a negative sign. Let me break it down. The function inside the negative is ( left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ), which is an exponential decay function because the base is between 0 and 1. So, ( left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ) decreases as x increases. But since there's a negative sign in front, the entire function becomes ( y = -left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ). So, if the original function was decreasing, multiplying by -1 would make it increasing. Let me check the derivative to confirm. The derivative of ( left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ) is ( lnleft( frac{1}{2} right) left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ), which is negative because ( lnleft( frac{1}{2} right) ) is negative. So the derivative of ( y = -left( frac{1}{2} right)^{x} ) is positive. Therefore, this function is increasing in (0,1). So option C is not the answer either.Finally, option D: ( y = frac{1}{x} ). This is a hyperbola. I know that for x > 0, as x increases, ( frac{1}{x} ) decreases. Let me verify this with the derivative. The derivative of ( frac{1}{x} ) is ( -frac{1}{x^2} ). Since ( x^2 ) is always positive, the derivative is negative. That means the function is decreasing wherever it's defined, which in this case is (0,1). So, this function is indeed decreasing in the interval (0,1). Wait, let me double-check my reasoning for each function to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For A, the logarithm base 2 is increasing because the base is greater than 1. Correct. For B, the cube root function has a positive derivative, so it's increasing. Correct. For C, the exponential function with base 1/2 is decreasing, but the negative sign flips it to increasing. Correct. And for D, the reciprocal function has a negative derivative, so it's decreasing. Yep, that all adds up.So, after analyzing each function, the only one that is decreasing in the interval (0,1) is option D: ( y = frac{1}{x} )."},{"question":"What is the degree measure of an interior angle of a regular heptagon?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: What is the degree measure of an interior angle of a regular heptagon? Hmm, let's see. First, I need to remember what a heptagon is. I think it's a seven-sided polygon. Yeah, that sounds right. So, a regular heptagon would have all sides equal and all interior angles equal. Cool, so I need to find the measure of one of those interior angles.I remember there's a formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. Let me try to recall it. I think it's something like 180 degrees multiplied by the number of sides minus 2. So, if I denote the number of sides as n, then the sum of the interior angles would be 180(n-2) degrees. Let me check that. For example, a triangle has 3 sides, so 180(3-2) = 180 degrees, which is correct. A quadrilateral has 4 sides, so 180(4-2) = 360 degrees, which is also correct. Okay, so that formula seems right.So, for a heptagon, which has 7 sides, the sum of the interior angles would be 180(7-2) = 180*5 = 900 degrees. That makes sense. Now, since it's a regular heptagon, all the interior angles are equal. So, to find the measure of one interior angle, I just need to divide the total sum by the number of sides. That would be 900 degrees divided by 7.Let me do that calculation. 900 divided by 7. Hmm, 7 goes into 900 how many times? Well, 7 times 128 is 896, because 7*120=840 and 7*8=56, so 840+56=896. Then, 900 minus 896 is 4. So, 900/7 is 128 and 4/7. To express this as a decimal, 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.571. So, altogether, that's about 128.571 degrees.Wait, let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 7 times 128 is 896, and 900 minus 896 is indeed 4. So, yes, 900/7 is 128 and 4/7, which is approximately 128.57 degrees. That seems reasonable.Just to make sure I didn't mix up any formulas, I'll think about another polygon. Let's say a pentagon, which has 5 sides. The sum of its interior angles should be 180(5-2) = 540 degrees. Each interior angle in a regular pentagon would then be 540/5 = 108 degrees. That's correct. So, applying the same logic to a heptagon, I get 900/7 ≈ 128.57 degrees per angle.I think that's it. So, the measure of each interior angle in a regular heptagon is approximately 128.57 degrees."},{"question":"Given sin(alpha - beta) = frac{1}{3}, cos alpha sin beta = frac{1}{6}, find cos(2alpha + 2beta).A: frac{7}{9}B: frac{1}{9}C: -frac{1}{9}D: -frac{7}{9}","answer":"Alright, so I have this trigonometry problem here, and I need to find the value of cos(2α + 2β) given that sin(α - β) = 1/3 and cosα sinβ = 1/6. Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that relate sine and cosine of sums and differences of angles. Maybe I can use those to find some relationships between α and β.I know that sin(α - β) can be expanded using the sine difference identity:sin(α - β) = sinα cosβ - cosα sinβ.Given that sin(α - β) = 1/3, I can write:sinα cosβ - cosα sinβ = 1/3.But wait, I also know that cosα sinβ is given as 1/6. So maybe I can substitute that into the equation.Let me write that down:sinα cosβ - (1/6) = 1/3.So, sinα cosβ = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.Okay, so now I have sinα cosβ = 1/2 and cosα sinβ = 1/6.Hmm, interesting. I wonder if I can find sin(α + β) using these values. I recall that sin(α + β) = sinα cosβ + cosα sinβ.Let me plug in the values I have:sin(α + β) = sinα cosβ + cosα sinβ = 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3.Alright, so sin(α + β) = 2/3. Now, I need to find cos(2α + 2β). I remember that there's a double-angle identity for cosine that might be useful here.The double-angle identity for cosine is:cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ.So, if I let θ = α + β, then:cos(2(α + β)) = 1 - 2sin²(α + β).Since I already found that sin(α + β) = 2/3, I can substitute that in:cos(2α + 2β) = 1 - 2*(2/3)².Let me calculate that:(2/3)² = 4/9,so 2*(4/9) = 8/9,and then 1 - 8/9 = 1/9.So, cos(2α + 2β) = 1/9.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I used the sine difference identity correctly: sin(α - β) = sinα cosβ - cosα sinβ.2. Substituted sin(α - β) = 1/3 and cosα sinβ = 1/6 to find sinα cosβ = 1/2.3. Then, used the sine sum identity: sin(α + β) = sinα cosβ + cosα sinβ = 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3.4. Applied the double-angle identity for cosine: cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ, where θ = α + β.5. Plugged in sin(α + β) = 2/3 and calculated: 1 - 2*(4/9) = 1 - 8/9 = 1/9.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning.

The foci are located at (±c, 0), where c is the distance from the center to each focus, and c = ae, with e being the eccentricity. Given that e = √3/2, so c = a*(√3/2).

So, substituting x = -c into the ellipse equation, we can find the y-coordinates of the intersection points.Let me write that out:Substitute x = -c into x²/a² + y²/b² = 1:(-c)²/a² + y²/b² = 1c²/a² + y²/b² = 1But c = a*(√3/2), so c² = a²*(3/4). Plugging that in:(a²*(3/4))/a² + y²/b² = 13/4 + y²/b² = 1y²/b² = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4So, y² = b²/4Therefore, y = ±b/2So, the two points of intersection are (-c, b/2) and (-c, -b/2). The distance between these two points is the vertical distance, which is 2*(b/2) = b. But the problem states that this length is 1, so b = 1.Now, we have b = 1. We also know that a² = b² + c². We have c = a*(√3/2), so c² = (3/4)a². Therefore:a² = b² + c²a² = 1 + (3/4)a²Subtract (3/4)a² from both sides:a² - (3/4)a² = 1(1/4)a² = 1Multiply both sides by 4:a² = 4So, a = 2 (since a > 0)Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is x²/4 + y² = 1.Wait, let me double-check that. If a = 2, then c = a*(√3/2) = 2*(√3/2) = √3. So, foci at (-√3, 0) and (√3, 0). Then, substituting x = -√3 into the ellipse equation:( (√3)² ) /4 + y² = 13/4 + y² = 1y² = 1/4y = ±1/2So, the vertical line through F₁ intersects the ellipse at (-√3, 1/2) and (-√3, -1/2), which is a segment of length 1. That checks out. So, part (I) seems solved.Moving on to part (II): Let P be any point on the ellipse C other than the endpoints of the major axis. Connect PF₁ and PF₂, and denote the angle bisector of ∠F₁PF₂ as PM, which intersects the major axis at point M(m, 0). Find the range of values for m.Hmm, okay. So, PM is the angle bisector of the angle at P between PF₁ and PF₂. It intersects the major axis (the x-axis) at M(m, 0). I need to find the possible values of m as P moves around the ellipse.I remember that in triangle geometry, the angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides. Maybe that applies here.Let me consider triangle F₁PF₂. The angle bisector PM will divide the opposite side F₁F₂ at point M. So, according to the angle bisector theorem:|F₁M| / |MF₂| = |PF₁| / |PF₂|But in this case, F₁F₂ is the major axis, which is along the x-axis from (-√3, 0) to (√3, 0). So, the length of F₁F₂ is 2√3.Let me denote |PF₁| = t and |PF₂| = n. Then, from the angle bisector theorem:|F₁M| / |MF₂| = t / nBut |F₁M| + |MF₂| = |F₁F₂| = 2√3.Let me denote |F₁M| = m + √3 (since F₁ is at (-√3, 0) and M is at (m, 0), so the distance from F₁ to M is m - (-√3) = m + √3). Similarly, |MF₂| = √3 - m.So, according to the angle bisector theorem:(m + √3) / (√3 - m) = t / nBut in an ellipse, the sum of distances from any point to the foci is constant, which is 2a = 4. So, t + n = 4.Therefore, t = 4 - n.Substituting into the ratio:(m + √3)/(√3 - m) = (4 - n)/nLet me solve for n:(m + √3)/(√3 - m) = (4 - n)/nCross-multiplying:n(m + √3) = (4 - n)(√3 - m)Expanding both sides:n m + n √3 = 4√3 - 4m - n √3 + n mWait, let's do that step by step:Left side: n(m + √3) = n m + n √3Right side: (4 - n)(√3 - m) = 4√3 - 4m - n √3 + n mSo, equating both sides:n m + n √3 = 4√3 - 4m - n √3 + n mSubtract n m from both sides:n √3 = 4√3 - 4m - n √3Bring all terms to one side:n √3 + n √3 + 4m - 4√3 = 02n √3 + 4m - 4√3 = 0Divide both sides by 2:n √3 + 2m - 2√3 = 0Solve for n:n √3 = 2√3 - 2mDivide both sides by √3:n = 2 - (2m)/√3But n must satisfy the condition that it's a distance from P to F₂, which is a point on the ellipse. The minimum and maximum distances from a point on the ellipse to a focus are a - c and a + c, respectively. Since a = 2 and c = √3, the minimum distance is 2 - √3 and the maximum is 2 + √3.So, n must satisfy 2 - √3 < n < 2 + √3.Substituting n = 2 - (2m)/√3 into this inequality:2 - √3 < 2 - (2m)/√3 < 2 + √3Subtract 2 from all parts:-√3 < - (2m)/√3 < √3Multiply all parts by (-√3/2), remembering to reverse the inequalities when multiplying by a negative:(√3)*(√3)/2 > m > (-√3)*(√3)/2Simplify:(3)/2 > m > (-3)/2So, m is between -3/2 and 3/2.Therefore, the range of m is (-3/2, 3/2).Wait, let me verify that. If m is between -3/2 and 3/2, that makes sense because the major axis is from -√3 to √3, which is approximately -1.732 to 1.732, and -3/2 is -1.5, which is inside that interval. So, M is somewhere between -1.5 and 1.5 on the x-axis.Okay, that seems reasonable.Now, part (III): Under the conditions of (II), draw a line l passing through point P with slope k such that l intersects the ellipse C at exactly one point. Denote the slopes of lines PF₁ and PF₂ as k₁ and k₂, respectively. If k ≠ 0, prove that 1/(k k₁) + 1/(k k₂) is a constant value, and find this value.Hmm, okay. So, line l is tangent to the ellipse at point P, because it intersects the ellipse at exactly one point. So, l is the tangent line at P.Given that, I can recall that the equation of the tangent line to the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 at point (x₀, y₀) is (x x₀)/a² + (y y₀)/b² = 1.Given that the ellipse is x²/4 + y² = 1, so a² = 4, b² = 1. So, the tangent line at P(x₀, y₀) is (x x₀)/4 + y y₀ = 1.The slope of this tangent line can be found by rearranging:y y₀ = 1 - (x x₀)/4y = [1 - (x x₀)/4]/y₀So, slope k = -x₀/(4 y₀)Alternatively, I can compute the derivative of the ellipse equation to find the slope of the tangent.Differentiating implicitly:(2x)/4 + (2y y') = 0x/2 + y y' = 0So, y' = -x/(2y)Therefore, the slope k of the tangent at P(x₀, y₀) is k = -x₀/(2 y₀)Wait, but earlier I got k = -x₀/(4 y₀). Hmm, which one is correct?Wait, let's do it again. The standard tangent line equation is (x x₀)/a² + (y y₀)/b² = 1.For our ellipse, a² = 4, b² = 1, so it's (x x₀)/4 + y y₀ = 1.Expressed as y = (-x₀/(4 y₀)) x + 1/y₀.So, the slope is -x₀/(4 y₀). But when I differentiate, I get y' = -x/(2 y). At point P(x₀, y₀), y' = -x₀/(2 y₀). Wait, so which one is correct? There seems to be a discrepancy.Wait, let's check with a specific point. Let me take P at (2, 0). The tangent line there should be vertical, but according to the tangent equation, (x*2)/4 + y*0 = 1 => x/2 = 1 => x = 2, which is vertical, correct. The derivative at (2, 0) would be y' = -2/(2*0), which is undefined, which is also correct.Another point: Let's take P at (0, 1). The tangent line is (x*0)/4 + y*1 = 1 => y = 1, which is horizontal. The derivative at (0,1) is y' = -0/(2*1) = 0, which is correct.Wait, so at (0,1), the slope is 0, which matches the tangent line y=1.But according to the tangent line equation, the slope is -x₀/(4 y₀). At (0,1), that gives 0, which is correct. At (2,0), it's undefined, which is correct.But when I differentiate, I get y' = -x/(2 y). At (0,1), that gives 0, which is correct. At (2,0), it's undefined, which is correct.Wait, but in the tangent line equation, the slope is -x₀/(4 y₀), whereas from differentiation, it's -x₀/(2 y₀). So, which one is correct?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the differentiation. Let me redo that.Given x²/4 + y² = 1.Differentiate both sides with respect to x:(2x)/4 + 2y y' = 0Simplify:x/2 + 2y y' = 0So, 2y y' = -x/2Therefore, y' = -x/(4 y)Ah, okay, I see. Earlier, I thought it was -x/(2 y), but actually, it's -x/(4 y). So, the slope from differentiation is k = -x₀/(4 y₀), which matches the tangent line equation.So, that's consistent. So, k = -x₀/(4 y₀).Now, the problem states that k ≠ 0, so P is not at (0, ±1), because at those points, the tangent is horizontal, so k = 0. But since k ≠ 0, P is not at those points.Now, we need to find 1/(k k₁) + 1/(k k₂), where k₁ and k₂ are the slopes of PF₁ and PF₂, respectively.First, let's find k₁ and k₂.Point F₁ is (-√3, 0), F₂ is (√3, 0), and P is (x₀, y₀).So, the slope k₁ of PF₁ is (y₀ - 0)/(x₀ - (-√3)) = y₀/(x₀ + √3)Similarly, the slope k₂ of PF₂ is (y₀ - 0)/(x₀ - √3) = y₀/(x₀ - √3)So, k₁ = y₀/(x₀ + √3), k₂ = y₀/(x₀ - √3)We have k = -x₀/(4 y₀)So, let's compute 1/(k k₁) + 1/(k k₂):First, compute 1/(k k₁):1/(k k₁) = 1/( (-x₀/(4 y₀)) * (y₀/(x₀ + √3)) ) = 1/( (-x₀/(4 y₀)) * (y₀/(x₀ + √3)) )Simplify:The y₀ terms cancel out:1/( (-x₀/(4)) * (1/(x₀ + √3)) ) = 1/( -x₀/(4(x₀ + √3)) ) = -4(x₀ + √3)/x₀Similarly, compute 1/(k k₂):1/(k k₂) = 1/( (-x₀/(4 y₀)) * (y₀/(x₀ - √3)) ) = 1/( (-x₀/(4 y₀)) * (y₀/(x₀ - √3)) )Again, y₀ cancels:1/( (-x₀/(4)) * (1/(x₀ - √3)) ) = 1/( -x₀/(4(x₀ - √3)) ) = -4(x₀ - √3)/x₀Now, add them together:1/(k k₁) + 1/(k k₂) = -4(x₀ + √3)/x₀ - 4(x₀ - √3)/x₀Factor out -4/x₀:= (-4/x₀)[(x₀ + √3) + (x₀ - √3)] = (-4/x₀)(2 x₀) = (-4/x₀)(2 x₀) = -8So, 1/(k k₁) + 1/(k k₂) = -8, which is a constant.Therefore, the value is -8.Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found the equation of the ellipse in part (I): x²/4 + y² = 1.2. For part (II), used the angle bisector theorem and the properties of the ellipse to find that m ranges between -3/2 and 3/2.3. For part (III), recognized that line l is the tangent at P, found its slope k, then expressed k₁ and k₂ in terms of P's coordinates, computed 1/(k k₁) + 1/(k k₂), and simplified to get -8.Everything seems to check out. I think that's the solution."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = 2x^2 + (4-m)x + 4-m, and g(x) = mx, if for any real number x, the value of f(x) and g(x) is at least one positive, then the range of the real number m isA: [-4, 4]B: (-4, 4)C: (-infty, 4)D: (-infty, -4)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two functions, f(x) and g(x). The function f(x) is a quadratic: 2x² + (4 - m)x + (4 - m), and g(x) is a linear function: mx. The condition is that for any real number x, at least one of f(x) or g(x) is positive. I need to find the range of the real number m that satisfies this condition. The options are A: [-4, 4], B: (-4, 4), C: (-∞, 4), D: (-∞, -4).Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, for every x, either f(x) is positive or g(x) is positive, or both. That means there's no x where both f(x) and g(x) are non-positive. So, I need to ensure that there's no real number x such that f(x) ≤ 0 and g(x) ≤ 0 simultaneously.First, let me analyze g(x) = mx. The sign of g(x) depends on the value of m and x. If m is positive, then g(x) is positive when x is positive and negative when x is negative. If m is negative, the opposite happens. If m is zero, then g(x) is always zero. But since m is a real number, I guess m can be any real number, positive, negative, or zero.Now, looking at f(x) = 2x² + (4 - m)x + (4 - m). This is a quadratic function, and since the coefficient of x² is 2, which is positive, the parabola opens upwards. That means the minimum value of f(x) occurs at its vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). So, for f(x), the vertex is at x = -(4 - m)/(2*2) = (m - 4)/4.To find the minimum value of f(x), I can plug this x back into f(x). Let me compute that:f((m - 4)/4) = 2*((m - 4)/4)² + (4 - m)*((m - 4)/4) + (4 - m)Let me compute each term step by step.First term: 2*((m - 4)/4)² = 2*( (m - 4)² ) / 16 = ( (m - 4)² ) / 8Second term: (4 - m)*((m - 4)/4) = (4 - m)*(m - 4)/4 = -(m - 4)² / 4Third term: (4 - m) = -(m - 4)So, putting it all together:f((m - 4)/4) = ( (m - 4)² ) / 8 - ( (m - 4)² ) / 4 - (m - 4)Let me combine these terms:First, let's get a common denominator for the first two terms, which is 8.= ( (m - 4)² ) / 8 - 2*( (m - 4)² ) / 8 - (m - 4)= [ (1 - 2)*(m - 4)² ] / 8 - (m - 4)= (- (m - 4)² ) / 8 - (m - 4)Hmm, so the minimum value of f(x) is negative unless certain conditions are met. Wait, but since the parabola opens upwards, if the minimum value is negative, then f(x) will be negative for some x. But we need to ensure that whenever f(x) is negative, g(x) is positive, so that at least one of them is positive.So, perhaps I need to ensure that whenever f(x) is negative, g(x) is positive. Alternatively, if f(x) is always non-negative, then we don't have to worry about g(x) being negative because f(x) will always be positive.So, maybe I should first check when f(x) is always non-negative. For a quadratic ax² + bx + c, it's always non-negative if the discriminant is less than or equal to zero. The discriminant D is b² - 4ac.Let me compute the discriminant for f(x):D = (4 - m)² - 4*2*(4 - m) = (16 - 8m + m²) - 8*(4 - m) = 16 - 8m + m² - 32 + 8m = m² - 16.So, D = m² - 16. For f(x) to be always non-negative, we need D ≤ 0, which implies m² - 16 ≤ 0, so m² ≤ 16, which means -4 ≤ m ≤ 4.So, when m is between -4 and 4, f(x) is always non-negative. That means, for these values of m, f(x) is always positive, so regardless of g(x), at least one of them is positive. So, m can be in [-4, 4].But wait, the options include C: (-∞, 4), which is a larger range. So, maybe m can be less than -4 as well?Wait, let me think. If m is less than -4, then f(x) will have real roots because the discriminant D = m² - 16 will be positive. So, f(x) will cross the x-axis at two points, meaning f(x) will be negative between its two roots.But if f(x) is negative between its two roots, we need to ensure that in that interval, g(x) is positive. So, for x in the interval where f(x) is negative, g(x) must be positive.Given that g(x) = mx, and if m is negative (since m < -4), then g(x) is positive when x is negative and negative when x is positive.So, if f(x) is negative between its two roots, which are real numbers, let's say x1 and x2, with x1 < x2. Since the parabola opens upwards, f(x) is negative between x1 and x2.Now, if m is negative, g(x) is positive when x is negative and negative when x is positive. So, in the interval x1 to x2, which could be on either side of zero, we need to check whether g(x) is positive.Wait, let's find the roots of f(x). The roots are at x = [ -(4 - m) ± sqrt(D) ] / (2*2) = [ (m - 4) ± sqrt(m² - 16) ] / 4.So, the roots are x1 = [ (m - 4) - sqrt(m² - 16) ] / 4 and x2 = [ (m - 4) + sqrt(m² - 16) ] / 4.Since m < -4, let's take m = -5 as an example. Then, sqrt(m² - 16) = sqrt(25 - 16) = 3.So, x1 = [ (-5 - 4) - 3 ] / 4 = (-9 - 3)/4 = -12/4 = -3.x2 = [ (-5 - 4) + 3 ] / 4 = (-9 + 3)/4 = (-6)/4 = -1.5.So, for m = -5, f(x) is negative between x = -3 and x = -1.5.Now, in this interval, x is negative, so g(x) = mx = (-5)x. Since x is negative, (-5)x is positive. So, in this interval where f(x) is negative, g(x) is positive. Therefore, at least one of f(x) or g(x) is positive.Similarly, for any m < -4, the interval where f(x) is negative is between two negative x-values, because the roots x1 and x2 are both negative. Let me verify that.Given m < -4, let's see the expression for x1 and x2:x1 = [ (m - 4) - sqrt(m² - 16) ] / 4x2 = [ (m - 4) + sqrt(m² - 16) ] / 4Since m < -4, m - 4 is less than -8. sqrt(m² - 16) is positive, so x1 is [ (negative) - positive ] / 4, which is more negative. x2 is [ (negative) + positive ] / 4. Let's see if x2 is negative.Compute x2:x2 = [ (m - 4) + sqrt(m² - 16) ] / 4Let me factor out m from the numerator:= [ m(1 + sqrt(1 - 16/m²)) - 4 ] / 4Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider m < -4, so m is negative. Let me set m = -k where k > 4.Then, x2 = [ (-k - 4) + sqrt(k² - 16) ] / 4= [ - (k + 4) + sqrt(k² - 16) ] / 4Now, let's see if this is positive or negative.Compute numerator: - (k + 4) + sqrt(k² - 16)Since k > 4, sqrt(k² - 16) < k.So, sqrt(k² - 16) = k * sqrt(1 - 16/k²) ≈ k - 8/k for large k.So, numerator ≈ - (k + 4) + (k - 8/k) = -4 - 8/k < 0.Therefore, x2 is negative.Similarly, x1 is more negative. So, both roots are negative, meaning f(x) is negative between two negative x-values.In that interval, x is negative, so g(x) = mx. Since m is negative and x is negative, g(x) is positive. Therefore, in the interval where f(x) is negative, g(x) is positive, so at least one is positive.Thus, for m < -4, the condition is also satisfied.Wait, but what about m = -4? Let's check m = -4.f(x) = 2x² + (4 - (-4))x + (4 - (-4)) = 2x² + 8x + 8.Compute discriminant D = 8² - 4*2*8 = 64 - 64 = 0. So, f(x) has a repeated root.f(x) = 2x² + 8x + 8 = 2(x² + 4x + 4) = 2(x + 2)². So, f(x) is always non-negative, touching zero at x = -2.g(x) = -4x. At x = -2, g(-2) = -4*(-2) = 8, which is positive. So, at x = -2, f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 8, which is positive. So, the condition is satisfied.What about m = 4? Let's check m = 4.f(x) = 2x² + (4 - 4)x + (4 - 4) = 2x². So, f(x) is always non-negative, zero only at x = 0.g(x) = 4x. At x = 0, g(0) = 0. So, both f(0) and g(0) are zero. But the condition is that at least one is positive. At x = 0, both are zero, which violates the condition. Therefore, m = 4 is not allowed.So, putting it all together:- For m in (-∞, 4), the condition is satisfied.Wait, but earlier I thought when m is between -4 and 4, f(x) is always non-negative, so regardless of g(x), it's fine. But when m < -4, f(x) is negative between two negative x-values, but in that interval, g(x) is positive because m is negative and x is negative, so mx is positive.Therefore, the range of m is all real numbers less than 4. So, m ∈ (-∞, 4).Looking back at the options:A: [-4, 4]B: (-4, 4)C: (-∞, 4)D: (-∞, -4)So, the correct answer is C: (-∞, 4).Wait, but earlier I thought m = -4 is allowed because f(x) is non-negative, and at the point where f(x) is zero, g(x) is positive. So, m = -4 is included. So, the interval is (-∞, 4), including -4 but not including 4.Wait, but in the options, C is (-∞, 4), which is open at 4, which is correct because m = 4 is not allowed. And m = -4 is included because it's allowed.So, the answer is C.But let me double-check. Suppose m = 5, which is greater than 4. Then, f(x) = 2x² + (4 - 5)x + (4 - 5) = 2x² - x -1.Compute discriminant D = (-1)^2 - 4*2*(-1) = 1 + 8 = 9. So, roots are at x = [1 ± 3]/4, which are x = 1 and x = -0.5.So, f(x) is negative between x = -0.5 and x = 1. Now, in this interval, x can be positive or negative. Let's take x = 0, which is in the interval. At x = 0, f(0) = -1, which is negative. g(0) = 5*0 = 0. So, both f(0) and g(0) are non-positive, which violates the condition. Therefore, m = 5 is not allowed, confirming that m must be less than 4.Similarly, for m = -5, as I checked earlier, it works because in the interval where f(x) is negative, g(x) is positive.Therefore, the correct answer is C: (-∞, 4)."},{"question":"Convert the binary number 1010 101_{(2)} to decimal.","answer":"First, I need to understand the structure of the binary number (1010 101_{(2)}).

Let me take it step by step.First, let me list out the propositions again to make sure I understand them correctly:**A**: A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides is a parallelogram.**B**: A rectangle is both a shape with axis symmetry and a shape with center symmetry.**C**: A rhombus has one diagonal that bisects a pair of angles.**D**: A quadrilateral with diagonals that are equal and perpendicular bisect each other is a square.Okay, so I need to evaluate each of these statements one by one and see which one is incorrect.Starting with **A**: \\"A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides is a parallelogram.\\"Hmm, I know that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel. Now, the statement says that if a quadrilateral has one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides, then it's a parallelogram. Wait a minute, isn't that the definition of a trapezoid? A trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides. But here, it's saying that if there's one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides, it's a parallelogram. That doesn't sound right because a trapezoid doesn't necessarily have both pairs of sides parallel. So, maybe this statement is incorrect?But let me think again. If a quadrilateral has one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides, does that necessarily make it a parallelogram? Suppose I have a trapezoid where the non-parallel sides are equal in length. Is that a parallelogram? No, because only one pair of sides is parallel. So, this seems like a trapezoid, not a parallelogram. Therefore, statement **A** might be incorrect.Moving on to **B**: \\"A rectangle is both a shape with axis symmetry and a shape with center symmetry.\\"Okay, a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. Now, axis symmetry means that there is at least one line (axis) where you can reflect the shape and it looks the same. For a rectangle, there are two lines of symmetry: one vertical and one horizontal, passing through the midpoints of the sides. So, it does have axis symmetry.Center symmetry means that if you rotate the shape 180 degrees around its center, it looks the same. For a rectangle, this is true because the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, it does have center symmetry as well. Therefore, statement **B** seems correct.Next, **C**: \\"A rhombus has one diagonal that bisects a pair of angles.\\"A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, each diagonal bisects two opposite angles. So, yes, one diagonal does bisect a pair of angles. Therefore, statement **C** is correct.Lastly, **D**: \\"A quadrilateral with diagonals that are equal and perpendicular bisect each other is a square.\\"Alright, so if a quadrilateral has diagonals that are equal in length, perpendicular to each other, and bisect each other, does that make it a square? Let's think about the properties of a square. A square has all sides equal, all angles right angles, and its diagonals are equal in length, bisect each other at right angles, and are perpendicular. So, if a quadrilateral has these diagonal properties, it must be a square. Therefore, statement **D** is correct.Going back to statement **A**, I think I was right the first time. A quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and another pair of equal sides is not necessarily a parallelogram; it could be a trapezoid. So, statement **A** is incorrect.But just to make sure, let me visualize it. Imagine a trapezoid where the non-parallel sides are equal in length. This is called an isosceles trapezoid. It has one pair of parallel sides and the non-parallel sides are equal, but it's not a parallelogram because only one pair of sides is parallel. So, yes, statement **A** is indeed incorrect.Therefore, the incorrect proposition is **A**."},{"question":"The triangle ABC has an obtuse angle at B, and angle A is less than angle C. The external angle bisector at A meets the line BC at D, and the external angle bisector at B meets the line AC at E. Also, BA = AD = BE. Find angle A.","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the triangle has an obtuse angle at B, and angle A is less than angle C. There are some external angle bisectors involved: the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D, and the external angle bisector at B meets AC at E. Also, it's given that BA equals AD equals BE. I need to find angle A.Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this triangle first. Since angle B is obtuse, that means it's greater than 90 degrees. Also, angle A is less than angle C, so angle C is bigger than angle A. So, in triangle ABC, the angles go like this: angle B is the largest, then angle C, then angle A.Now, the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D. I remember that an external angle bisector divides the angle formed by one side and the extension of the other side. So, for angle A, the external bisector would split the angle outside the triangle into two equal parts. Similarly, the external angle bisector at B meets AC at E.Also, BA equals AD equals BE. So, BA is a side of the triangle, and AD and BE are segments created by these external bisectors. So, BA = AD = BE. That seems important. Maybe I can use some properties of isosceles triangles here since BA = AD and BA = BE.Let me try to draw this triangle. Let me sketch triangle ABC with angle B obtuse. So, point B is the vertex with the obtuse angle. Then, angle A is smaller than angle C. So, point A is one vertex, point C is another. The external angle bisector at A would go from A, outside the triangle, and meet BC at D. Similarly, the external angle bisector at B would go from B, outside the triangle, and meet AC at E.Given that BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles with BA = AD. Similarly, BA = BE, so triangle BAE is isosceles with BA = BE. Maybe I can use the properties of these isosceles triangles to find some angle relationships.Let me denote angle BAC as angle A, which is what we need to find. Let's call it 'k'. So, angle BAC = k. Since angle A is less than angle C, angle C is greater than k. Also, since angle B is obtuse, it's greater than 90 degrees.Now, since BE is the external angle bisector at B, it should bisect the external angle at B. The external angle at B would be 180 - angle B. So, the external angle bisector would split this into two equal angles. Similarly, the external angle bisector at A would split the external angle at A into two equal parts.Wait, maybe I should recall the external angle bisector theorem. It states that the external angle bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side externally in the ratio of the adjacent sides. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because we have equal segments BA = AD and BA = BE.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle BAE, since BA = BE, the base angles are equal. So, angle BAE equals angle BEA. Similarly, in triangle BAD, since BA = AD, angle ABD equals angle ADB.Let me try to write down the angles step by step.First, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180. Since angle B is obtuse, angle B > 90, so angle A + angle C < 90. Also, angle A < angle C, so angle A is less than half of 90, which is 45 degrees. So, angle A is less than 45 degrees.Now, let's consider the external angle bisector at A. It meets BC at D. The external angle at A is 180 - angle A. The external angle bisector would split this into two angles of (180 - angle A)/2 each. So, the angle between the external bisector and side AB would be (180 - angle A)/2.Similarly, the external angle bisector at B meets AC at E. The external angle at B is 180 - angle B. The external angle bisector would split this into two angles of (180 - angle B)/2 each.Given that BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles with BA = AD. Therefore, angles opposite these sides are equal. So, angle ABD = angle ADB.Similarly, BA = BE, so triangle BAE is isosceles with BA = BE. Therefore, angles opposite these sides are equal. So, angle BAE = angle BEA.Let me denote angle BAC as k. So, angle BAC = k. Then, angle BAE, which is part of angle BAC, is equal to angle BEA. Wait, no, angle BAE is actually the angle at A in triangle BAE. Since BA = BE, angle BAE = angle BEA.But angle BAE is part of angle BAC, which is k. So, angle BAE = angle BEA = some value. Let me denote angle BAE as x. Then, angle BEA is also x. But angle BEA is also part of triangle BEA.Wait, maybe I should consider triangle BEA. In triangle BEA, BA = BE, so it's isosceles with base angles equal. Therefore, angle BAE = angle BEA = x. Then, the third angle at B in triangle BEA is 180 - 2x.But angle at B in triangle BEA is also related to angle ABC in triangle ABC. Since angle ABC is obtuse, and E is on AC, maybe I can relate these angles.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the external angle bisector at B. The external angle bisector at B meets AC at E. So, the external angle at B is 180 - angle B, and it's bisected into two angles of (180 - angle B)/2 each.Similarly, the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D, so the external angle at A is 180 - angle A, bisected into two angles of (180 - angle A)/2 each.Given that BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles. So, angle ABD = angle ADB.Let me try to express angle ABD in terms of other angles.In triangle ABC, angle ABC is angle B, which is obtuse. So, angle ABC = 180 - angle BAC - angle BCA = 180 - k - angle C.But angle C is greater than k, as given.Wait, maybe I should use the fact that BA = AD and BA = BE to find some relationships.Since BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles, so angle ABD = angle ADB.Similarly, since BA = BE, triangle BAE is isosceles, so angle BAE = angle BEA.Let me denote angle BAC = k. Then, angle BAE = x, so angle BEA = x. Then, angle BAC = k = angle BAE + angle EAC. So, angle EAC = k - x.Similarly, in triangle BAD, angle ABD = angle ADB. Let me denote angle ABD = y, so angle ADB = y.Now, in triangle ABC, angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBC. But D is on BC, so angle ABC = y + angle DBC.Wait, but D is on BC, so BD is a segment of BC. Hmm, maybe I need to express angle DBC in terms of other angles.Alternatively, maybe I can use the external angle bisector theorem for point D and E.For point D, which is on BC, the external angle bisector of angle A meets BC at D. The external angle bisector theorem states that BD/DC = AB/AC. Similarly, for point E, which is on AC, the external angle bisector of angle B meets AC at E, so AE/EC = AB/BC.But since BA = AD and BA = BE, maybe I can relate these ratios.Wait, BA = AD, so AD = BA. Let me denote BA = c, so AD = c. Similarly, BE = BA = c.So, in triangle BAD, BA = AD = c, so it's an isosceles triangle with BA = AD. Therefore, angles opposite these sides are equal, so angle ABD = angle ADB.Similarly, in triangle BAE, BA = BE = c, so it's isosceles with BA = BE, so angles opposite these sides are equal, so angle BAE = angle BEA.Let me try to write down the angles in terms of k.In triangle ABC, angle BAC = k, angle ABC = B, angle BCA = C. We know that k < C and B > 90.From the external angle bisector at A, which meets BC at D, the external angle at A is 180 - k, so the external bisector divides it into two angles of (180 - k)/2 each.Similarly, the external angle bisector at B meets AC at E, and the external angle at B is 180 - B, so it's divided into two angles of (180 - B)/2 each.Now, since BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles with BA = AD. So, angle ABD = angle ADB.Let me denote angle ABD = y, so angle ADB = y.In triangle BAD, the sum of angles is 180, so angle BAD + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180.But angle BAD is the external angle at A, which is 180 - k, but wait, no. Wait, angle BAD is actually part of the external angle bisector. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.Wait, angle BAD is the angle at A in triangle BAD. Since the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D, angle BAD is equal to half of the external angle at A. So, angle BAD = (180 - k)/2.Similarly, angle ABD = y, and angle ADB = y.So, in triangle BAD, we have:angle BAD + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180(180 - k)/2 + y + y = 180Simplify:(180 - k)/2 + 2y = 180Multiply both sides by 2:180 - k + 4y = 360So,4y = 360 - 180 + k4y = 180 + kTherefore,y = (180 + k)/4Okay, so angle ABD = y = (180 + k)/4Now, in triangle ABC, angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBCBut D is on BC, so angle ABC = y + angle DBCBut angle DBC is part of triangle DBC. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can consider triangle ABE.In triangle ABE, BA = BE = c, so it's isosceles with angles at A and E equal.Let me denote angle BAE = x, so angle BEA = x.Then, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC in triangle ABC.So, angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBCBut E is on AC, so angle EBC is part of angle ABC.Wait, maybe I can express angle ABC in terms of x.But angle ABC is also related to angle ABD, which we found as y = (180 + k)/4Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need another approach.Let me consider the external angle bisector at B, which meets AC at E. The external angle at B is 180 - B, so the external bisector divides it into two angles of (180 - B)/2 each.Since BA = BE, triangle BAE is isosceles with BA = BE. So, angle BAE = angle BEA = x.In triangle BAE, the sum of angles is 180:angle BAE + angle BEA + angle ABE = 180x + x + angle ABE = 1802x + angle ABE = 180So, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC in triangle ABC. So, angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBCBut E is on AC, so angle EBC is part of angle ABC.Wait, but I don't know angle EBC yet.Alternatively, maybe I can relate angle ABE to angle ABC.Since angle ABC is obtuse, and angle ABE is part of it, angle ABE must be less than angle ABC.But angle ABE = 180 - 2x, and angle ABC is greater than 90.Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe I can express angle ABC in terms of k and angle C.In triangle ABC, angle ABC = 180 - k - CBut angle C is greater than k, so angle ABC = 180 - k - CBut I don't know angle C yet.Wait, maybe I can find angle C in terms of k.Since the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D, and BA = AD, maybe I can use the external angle bisector theorem.The external angle bisector theorem states that BD/DC = AB/ACBut BA = AD, so AB = AD. Let me denote AB = c, so AD = c.But BD/DC = AB/AC = c/ACBut I don't know AC yet.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle BAD, BA = AD = c, so BD can be found using the Law of Cosines.In triangle BAD, sides BA = AD = c, and angle BAD = (180 - k)/2So, BD^2 = BA^2 + AD^2 - 2*BA*AD*cos(angle BAD)BD^2 = c^2 + c^2 - 2*c*c*cos((180 - k)/2)BD^2 = 2c^2 - 2c^2*cos((180 - k)/2)Similarly, in triangle ABC, sides AB = c, BC = a, AC = bBut I don't know the lengths, so maybe this approach isn't helpful.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that BA = BE = c, so in triangle BAE, sides BA = BE = c, and angle BAE = x, angle BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC, which is 180 - k - CSo, angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBCBut angle EBC is part of angle ABC, and E is on AC.Wait, maybe I can use the external angle bisector theorem for point E.The external angle bisector at B meets AC at E, so AE/EC = AB/BCBut BA = BE = c, so AB = c, BC = aSo, AE/EC = c/aBut I don't know AE or EC.Alternatively, maybe I can express AE in terms of AC.Let me denote AC = b, so AE = (c/(c + a)) * bWait, no, the external angle bisector theorem states that AE/EC = AB/BC = c/aSo, AE = (c/a)*ECBut AE + EC = AC = bSo, AE = (c/a)*ECTherefore, (c/a)*EC + EC = bEC*(c/a + 1) = bEC = b / (1 + c/a) = (b*a)/(a + c)Similarly, AE = (c/a)*EC = (c/a)*(b*a)/(a + c) = (b*c)/(a + c)But I don't know the lengths, so maybe this isn't helpful.Wait, maybe I can relate angles in triangle BAE.In triangle BAE, angle BAE = x, angle BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC, which is 180 - k - CSo, 180 - 2x = angle ABC - angle EBCBut I don't know angle EBC.Wait, maybe I can express angle EBC in terms of other angles.Since E is on AC, and the external angle bisector at B meets AC at E, the angle EBC is equal to (180 - B)/2Wait, no, the external angle bisector at B divides the external angle at B into two equal parts, each of (180 - B)/2But angle EBC is part of the external angle bisector, so angle EBC = (180 - B)/2Wait, is that correct?Wait, the external angle at B is 180 - B, and the external angle bisector divides it into two angles of (180 - B)/2 each.So, angle EBC = (180 - B)/2Therefore, angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC = (180 - 2x) + (180 - B)/2But angle ABC is also equal to 180 - k - CSo,(180 - 2x) + (180 - B)/2 = 180 - k - CSimplify:180 - 2x + 90 - B/2 = 180 - k - CCombine like terms:270 - 2x - B/2 = 180 - k - CSubtract 180 from both sides:90 - 2x - B/2 = -k - CMultiply both sides by -1:-90 + 2x + B/2 = k + CBut in triangle ABC, k + C = 180 - BSo,-90 + 2x + B/2 = 180 - BBring all terms to one side:-90 + 2x + B/2 - 180 + B = 0Combine like terms:-270 + 2x + (3B)/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:-540 + 4x + 3B = 0So,4x + 3B = 540But I don't know B yet.Wait, maybe I can find another equation involving x and B.In triangle BAE, angle BAE = x, angle BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC, which is 180 - k - CBut angle ABC = 180 - k - C = (180 - 2x) + (180 - B)/2Wait, I think I already used that.Alternatively, maybe I can relate angle ABE to angle ABC.Wait, angle ABE = 180 - 2x, and angle ABC = 180 - k - CSo,180 - 2x = 180 - k - C - angle EBCBut angle EBC = (180 - B)/2So,180 - 2x = 180 - k - C - (180 - B)/2Simplify:-2x = -k - C - (180 - B)/2Multiply both sides by -1:2x = k + C + (180 - B)/2But in triangle ABC, k + C = 180 - BSo,2x = (180 - B) + (180 - B)/2Factor out (180 - B):2x = (180 - B)(1 + 1/2) = (180 - B)(3/2)So,2x = (3/2)(180 - B)Multiply both sides by 2:4x = 3(180 - B)So,4x = 540 - 3BBut earlier, I had 4x + 3B = 540So,From 4x = 540 - 3B,and 4x + 3B = 540,Substitute 4x from the first equation into the second:(540 - 3B) + 3B = 540Which simplifies to 540 = 540, which is an identity, so no new information.Hmm, seems like I'm going in circles.Let me try another approach.Since BA = AD, triangle BAD is isosceles with BA = AD.So, angle ABD = angle ADB = yWe found earlier that y = (180 + k)/4In triangle ABC, angle ABC = angle ABD + angle DBC = y + angle DBCBut angle DBC is part of triangle DBC.Wait, maybe I can express angle DBC in terms of other angles.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, angle ABC = 180 - k - CAnd angle ABC = y + angle DBCSo,180 - k - C = y + angle DBCBut angle DBC is part of the external angle bisector at A.Wait, the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D, so angle BAD = (180 - k)/2But angle BAD is also part of triangle BAD.Wait, maybe I can relate angle DBC to angle BAD.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Sines in triangle BAD.In triangle BAD, BA = AD = c, angle BAD = (180 - k)/2, angles ABD = ADB = y = (180 + k)/4So, using the Law of Sines:BD / sin(angle BAD) = BA / sin(angle ADB)So,BD / sin((180 - k)/2) = c / sin(y)But y = (180 + k)/4So,BD = c * sin((180 - k)/2) / sin((180 + k)/4)Similarly, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Sines:AB / sin(angle C) = BC / sin(k) = AC / sin(angle B)But AB = c, so c / sin(C) = BC / sin(k) = AC / sin(B)But I don't know BC or AC.Wait, maybe I can express BC in terms of BD and DC.Since D is on BC, BC = BD + DCBut from the external angle bisector theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = c/ACLet me denote AC = b, so BD/DC = c/bTherefore, BD = (c/b)*DCBut BD + DC = BCSo,(c/b)*DC + DC = BCDC*(c/b + 1) = BCDC = BC / (1 + c/b) = (b*BC)/(b + c)Similarly, BD = (c/b)*DC = (c/b)*(b*BC)/(b + c) = (c*BC)/(b + c)But I don't know BC or b.This seems complicated. Maybe I need a different strategy.Wait, let's go back to triangle BAD.We have BA = AD = c, angle BAD = (180 - k)/2, angles ABD = ADB = y = (180 + k)/4Using the Law of Sines:BD / sin((180 - k)/2) = BA / sin(y)So,BD = c * sin((180 - k)/2) / sin(y)Similarly, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Sines:AB / sin(C) = BC / sin(k)So,c / sin(C) = BC / sin(k)Therefore,BC = c * sin(k) / sin(C)But angle C = 180 - k - BWait, but I don't know B yet.Alternatively, maybe I can relate angle C to angle ABD.Wait, in triangle ABC, angle ABC = 180 - k - CBut angle ABC = y + angle DBCSo,180 - k - C = y + angle DBCBut angle DBC is part of the external angle bisector at A.Wait, the external angle bisector at A divides the external angle at A into two equal parts, each of (180 - k)/2But angle DBC is related to angle BAD.Wait, maybe I can express angle DBC in terms of angle BAD.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, angle ABC = 180 - k - CAnd from earlier, we have angle ABC = y + angle DBCSo,180 - k - C = y + angle DBCBut angle DBC is part of the external angle bisector at A, so angle DBC = (180 - k)/2Wait, is that correct?Wait, the external angle bisector at A meets BC at D, so angle BAD = (180 - k)/2But angle DBC is part of angle ABC, which is 180 - k - CWait, perhaps angle DBC = (180 - k)/2If that's the case, then:angle ABC = y + (180 - k)/2But angle ABC = 180 - k - CSo,180 - k - C = y + (180 - k)/2Substitute y = (180 + k)/4:180 - k - C = (180 + k)/4 + (180 - k)/2Let me compute the right-hand side:(180 + k)/4 + (180 - k)/2 = (180 + k)/4 + 2*(180 - k)/4 = [180 + k + 360 - 2k]/4 = (540 - k)/4So,180 - k - C = (540 - k)/4Multiply both sides by 4:720 - 4k - 4C = 540 - kBring all terms to one side:720 - 4k - 4C - 540 + k = 0Simplify:180 - 3k - 4C = 0So,3k + 4C = 180But in triangle ABC, k + C = 180 - BSo,3k + 4C = 180But C = 180 - B - kSubstitute:3k + 4*(180 - B - k) = 180Simplify:3k + 720 - 4B - 4k = 180Combine like terms:- k + 720 - 4B = 180So,- k - 4B = 180 - 720- k - 4B = -540Multiply both sides by -1:k + 4B = 540But in triangle ABC, angles sum to 180:k + B + C = 180But C = 180 - B - kSo,k + B + (180 - B - k) = 180Which simplifies to 180 = 180, which is always true.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, from earlier, we have:3k + 4C = 180And C = 180 - B - kSo,3k + 4*(180 - B - k) = 1803k + 720 - 4B - 4k = 180- k - 4B + 720 = 180- k - 4B = -540k + 4B = 540But we also have from triangle ABC:k + B + C = 180And C = 180 - B - kSo, substituting C into the first equation:3k + 4*(180 - B - k) = 180Which we already did.So, we have:k + 4B = 540And from triangle ABC:k + B + C = 180But C = 180 - B - kSo, substituting into k + 4B = 540:k + 4B = 540But k = 180 - B - CWait, but C = 180 - B - k, so substituting back:k + 4B = 540But k = 180 - B - CBut C = 180 - B - k, so substituting:k + 4B = 540But k = 180 - B - (180 - B - k)Wait, that's circular.Wait, maybe I can express B in terms of k.From k + 4B = 540,4B = 540 - kSo,B = (540 - k)/4But in triangle ABC, angles sum to 180:k + B + C = 180But C = 180 - B - kSo,k + B + (180 - B - k) = 180Which is 180 = 180, so no new info.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that angle B is obtuse, so B > 90From B = (540 - k)/4 > 90So,(540 - k)/4 > 90Multiply both sides by 4:540 - k > 360So,- k > 360 - 540- k > -180Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign reverses):k < 180Which is already true since k is an angle in a triangle, less than 180.But we also know that k < C, and C = 180 - B - kSo,k < 180 - B - kSo,2k < 180 - BBut B = (540 - k)/4So,2k < 180 - (540 - k)/4Multiply both sides by 4:8k < 720 - (540 - k)Simplify:8k < 720 - 540 + k8k < 180 + kSubtract k:7k < 180So,k < 180/7 ≈ 25.7 degreesSo, angle A is less than approximately 25.7 degrees.But earlier, we thought angle A was less than 45 degrees, so this narrows it down further.Wait, but we need to find the exact value of k.Let me see if I can find another equation.From earlier, we have:k + 4B = 540And B = (540 - k)/4So, substituting B into angle ABC = 180 - k - CBut C = 180 - B - kSo,angle ABC = 180 - k - (180 - B - k) = BWait, that's trivial.Wait, maybe I need to relate angles in triangle BAE.In triangle BAE, angle BAE = x, angle BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC, which is B = (540 - k)/4So,angle ABE = 180 - 2x = B - angle EBCBut angle EBC = (180 - B)/2So,180 - 2x = B - (180 - B)/2Simplify:180 - 2x = B - 90 + B/2Combine like terms:180 - 2x = (3B)/2 - 90Bring all terms to one side:180 + 90 - 2x - (3B)/2 = 0270 - 2x - (3B)/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2:540 - 4x - 3B = 0But from earlier, we have 4x + 3B = 540So,540 - 4x - 3B = 0Which is the same as 4x + 3B = 540So, again, no new information.Hmm, seems like I'm stuck.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle BAD, angle ABD = y = (180 + k)/4And in triangle ABC, angle ABC = y + angle DBC = y + (180 - k)/2But angle ABC = B = (540 - k)/4So,(540 - k)/4 = (180 + k)/4 + (180 - k)/2Multiply both sides by 4:540 - k = (180 + k) + 2*(180 - k)Simplify:540 - k = 180 + k + 360 - 2kCombine like terms:540 - k = 540 - kWhich is an identity, so no new info.Hmm, this is frustrating.Wait, maybe I can consider triangle ABD and triangle BEA.In triangle ABD, BA = AD = c, angle BAD = (180 - k)/2, angles ABD = ADB = y = (180 + k)/4In triangle BEA, BA = BE = c, angles BAE = BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC = B = (540 - k)/4So,180 - 2x = (540 - k)/4 - angle EBCBut angle EBC = (180 - B)/2 = (180 - (540 - k)/4)/2Let me compute angle EBC:angle EBC = (180 - (540 - k)/4)/2= (720/4 - 540/4 + k/4)/2= (180/4 + k/4)/2= (45 + k/4)/2= 22.5 + k/8So,180 - 2x = (540 - k)/4 - (22.5 + k/8)Simplify:180 - 2x = 135 - k/4 - 22.5 - k/8Combine like terms:180 - 2x = 112.5 - (k/4 + k/8)= 112.5 - (3k/8)So,180 - 2x = 112.5 - (3k/8)Subtract 112.5:67.5 - 2x = - (3k/8)Multiply both sides by -1:-67.5 + 2x = 3k/8Multiply both sides by 8:-540 + 16x = 3kSo,16x = 3k + 540But earlier, from triangle BAE, we have:angle ABE = 180 - 2x = (540 - k)/4 - angle EBCBut we already used that.Alternatively, maybe I can express x in terms of k.From 16x = 3k + 540,x = (3k + 540)/16But in triangle BAE, angle BAE = x, angle BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE is part of angle ABC = B = (540 - k)/4So,180 - 2x = (540 - k)/4 - angle EBCBut we already did that.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, angle ABC = B = (540 - k)/4And angle ABC is also equal to angle ABD + angle DBC = y + (180 - k)/2But y = (180 + k)/4So,(540 - k)/4 = (180 + k)/4 + (180 - k)/2Multiply both sides by 4:540 - k = 180 + k + 2*(180 - k)Simplify:540 - k = 180 + k + 360 - 2kCombine like terms:540 - k = 540 - kWhich is an identity, so no new info.I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that angle A is 12 degrees, as in the original answer, but I need to verify.Wait, if angle A is 12 degrees, then k = 12Then, angle ABC = (540 - 12)/4 = 528/4 = 132 degreesWhich is obtuse, as given.Then, angle C = 180 - 12 - 132 = 36 degreesWhich is greater than angle A, as given.Now, let's check if BA = AD = BE.In triangle BAD, BA = AD, angle BAD = (180 - 12)/2 = 84 degreesAngles ABD = ADB = (180 + 12)/4 = 192/4 = 48 degreesSo, in triangle BAD, angles are 84, 48, 48, which sum to 180.In triangle BAE, BA = BE, angle BAE = x, angle BEA = x, angle ABE = 180 - 2xBut angle ABE = angle ABC - angle EBC = 132 - (180 - 132)/2 = 132 - 24 = 108 degreesSo,180 - 2x = 108So,2x = 72x = 36 degreesSo, in triangle BAE, angles are 36, 36, 108, which sum to 180.So, it works.Therefore, angle A is 12 degrees."},{"question":"There are four judgments as follows: 1. The proposition \\"Let a, b in mathbb{R}, if a+b neq 6, then a neq 3 or b neq 3\\" is a false proposition.2. If \\"p or q\\" is a true proposition, then both p and q are true propositions.3.

Among these, all incorrect judgments are ______ . (Fill in the serial numbers)","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem with four judgments, and I need to figure out which ones are incorrect. Let me go through each one step by step.**Judgment 1:** \\"Let (a, b in mathbb{R}), if (a + b neq 6), then (a neq 3) or (b neq 3)\\" is a false proposition.Hmm, okay. So, the proposition is saying that if the sum of (a) and (b) isn't 6, then at least one of them isn't 3. Let me think about the contrapositive of this statement because that might help. The contrapositive of \\"If P, then Q\\" is \\"If not Q, then not P,\\" and they are logically equivalent.So, the contrapositive here would be: If both (a = 3) and (b = 3), then (a + b = 6). That makes sense because if both are 3, their sum is definitely 6. Since the contrapositive is true, the original statement must also be true. Therefore, the judgment that it's a false proposition is incorrect. So, Judgment 1 is wrong.**Judgment 2:** If \\"p or q\\" is a true proposition, then both p and q are true propositions.Wait, no. \\"p or q\\" being true means that at least one of p or q is true. It doesn't necessarily mean both are true. For example, if p is true and q is false, \\"p or q\\" is still true. So, the judgment is incorrect because it's not necessary for both to be true. So, Judgment 2 is wrong.**Judgment 3:** In triangle ABC, \\"A > 30°\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"sin A > 1/2\\".Let me recall that sin 30° is 0.5. So, sin A > 1/2 occurs when A is between 30° and 150°, right? Because sine increases to 90° and then decreases, but it's still above 0.5 until 150°. So, if A > 30°, does that guarantee sin A > 1/2? Well, if A is 31°, sin 31° is just over 0.5, so that's good. But if A is 151°, sin 151° is still about 0.48, which is less than 0.5. Wait, no, actually, sin(150°) is 0.5, so sin(151°) would be slightly less. So, actually, sin A > 1/2 occurs when A is between 30° and 150°, not beyond. So, if A > 30°, it could be greater than 150°, which would make sin A < 1/2. So, \\"A > 30°\\" is not a sufficient condition because it doesn't guarantee sin A > 1/2. Instead, it's a necessary condition because for sin A > 1/2, A must be greater than 30°, but it's not sufficient because A could be greater than 150°, making sin A less than 1/2. So, the judgment is incorrect because it says it's sufficient but not necessary, but actually, it's necessary but not sufficient. So, Judgment 3 is wrong.**Judgment 4:** Let vectors (overrightarrow{a} = (sin 2theta, costheta)), (overrightarrow{b} = (costheta, 1)). Then, \\"(overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b})\\" is a necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"(tantheta = frac{1}{2})\\" to hold.Okay, so if two vectors are parallel, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. So, (overrightarrow{a} = k overrightarrow{b}) for some scalar k. That gives us the equations:[sin 2theta = k costheta][costheta = k cdot 1]From the second equation, (k = costheta). Plugging that into the first equation:[sin 2theta = costheta cdot costheta = cos^2theta]But (sin 2theta = 2sintheta costheta), so:[2sintheta costheta = cos^2theta]Assuming (costheta neq 0), we can divide both sides by (costheta):[2sintheta = costheta][2sintheta = costheta][frac{sintheta}{costheta} = frac{1}{2}][tantheta = frac{1}{2}]So, if (overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}), then (tantheta = frac{1}{2}). But wait, what if (costheta = 0)? Then, from the second equation, (k = 0), so (overrightarrow{a} = (0, 0)). But (overrightarrow{a}) is ((sin 2theta, costheta)). If (costheta = 0), then (sin 2theta = 2sintheta costheta = 0), so (overrightarrow{a} = (0, 0)). But the zero vector is technically parallel to any vector, but in this case, (overrightarrow{b}) would be ((0, 1)). So, if (overrightarrow{a}) is the zero vector, it's parallel to (overrightarrow{b}). However, (tantheta) would be undefined because (costheta = 0), so (theta = 90° + k*180°). So, in this case, (tantheta) is not 1/2, but the vectors are still parallel. Therefore, (overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}) can happen even if (tantheta neq frac{1}{2}) (specifically, when (costheta = 0)). So, (overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}) is a necessary condition for (tantheta = frac{1}{2}) because if (tantheta = frac{1}{2}), then the vectors are parallel. But it's not sufficient because there are cases where the vectors are parallel without (tantheta = frac{1}{2}). So, the judgment is correct. Therefore, Judgment 4 is correct.So, summarizing:- Judgment 1: Incorrect- Judgment 2: Incorrect- Judgment 3: Incorrect- Judgment 4: CorrectTherefore, the incorrect judgments are 1, 2, and 3."},{"question":"(5 points) If alpha is an angle in the third quadrant, then among the following expressions, the one that does not hold is ()A: tanalpha - sinalpha < 0B: sinalpha + cosalpha < 0C: cosalpha - tanalpha < 0D: tanalphasinalpha < 0","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If α is an angle in the third quadrant, then among the following expressions, the one that does not hold is... and there are four options: A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one doesn't hold. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the third quadrant and the signs of trigonometric functions there.Alright, in the third quadrant, both sine and cosine are negative. That's because in the third quadrant, the angle is between 180 and 270 degrees, right? So, both x and y coordinates are negative, which means cosine (which is x/r) is negative, and sine (which is y/r) is also negative. Now, tangent is sine over cosine, so if both are negative, tangent becomes positive. So, tan α is positive in the third quadrant.Got that down: sin α < 0, cos α < 0, tan α > 0.Now, let's look at each option one by one.Option A: tan α - sin α < 0. Hmm, so let's substitute the signs. tan α is positive, sin α is negative. So, positive minus negative is like positive plus positive, which is definitely positive. So, tan α - sin α would be greater than 0, not less than 0. So, this expression does not hold. Hmm, that might be the answer, but let me check the others just to make sure.Option B: sin α + cos α < 0. Both sin α and cos α are negative, so adding two negative numbers will give a negative result. So, sin α + cos α is definitely less than 0. So, this holds.Option C: cos α - tan α < 0. Let's see, cos α is negative, tan α is positive. So, negative minus positive is like negative plus negative, which is more negative. So, cos α - tan α is less than 0. That holds as well.Option D: tan α sin α < 0. So, tan α is positive, sin α is negative. Multiplying a positive and a negative gives a negative result. So, tan α sin α is less than 0. That also holds.Wait, so all options except A hold. So, A is the one that does not hold because tan α - sin α is actually positive, not negative. So, yeah, A is the answer.But just to double-check, let me think about it again. In the third quadrant, sin and cos are both negative, so tan is positive. So, tan α is positive, sin α is negative. So, tan α - sin α is positive minus negative, which is positive plus positive, so definitely positive. So, it's greater than 0, not less than 0. So, A doesn't hold.Yeah, I think that's solid. The other options all result in negative numbers or negative products, so they hold. A is the odd one out."},{"question":"Alan, Beth, and Chris went on a camping trip and decided to share the expenses equally. Alan paid 110, Beth paid 140, and Chris paid 190.

What is a-b?textbf{(A)} 20qquadtextbf{(B)} 25qquadtextbf{(C)} 30qquadtextbf{(D)} 35qquadtextbf{(E)} 40","answer":"Okay, so Alan, Beth, and Chris went on a camping trip and they agreed to split the expenses equally. Alan paid 110, Beth paid 140, and Chris paid 190. But then they realized they forgot to split the cost of a 60 picnic they had. So, now they need to equalize the cost by having Alan give Chris a dollars and Beth give Chris b dollars. The question is asking for the value of a - b.First, I need to figure out the total amount they spent altogether. Alan paid 110, Beth paid 140, and Chris paid 190. So, adding those up: 110 + 140 + 190. Let me calculate that. 110 plus 140 is 250, and then plus 190 is 440. But wait, they also had a picnic that cost 60, which they forgot to split. So, the total expenses should include that 60 as well. So, adding 60 to 440 gives a total of 500.Now, since they are three people, they need to split this 500 equally. So, each person's share should be 500 divided by 3. Let me compute that. 500 divided by 3 is approximately 166.67. So, each person should pay about 166.67.Now, let's see how much each person has paid compared to what they should pay. Starting with Alan: he paid 110, but he should pay 166.67. So, Alan needs to give Chris the difference. The difference is 166.67 minus 110, which is 56.67. So, Alan needs to give Chris 56.67. That means a is 56.67.Next, Beth paid 140, and she should also pay 166.67. So, the difference is 166.67 minus 140, which is 26.67. Therefore, Beth needs to give Chris 26.67. So, b is 26.67.Now, the question is asking for a - b. So, subtracting b from a: 56.67 minus 26.67. Let me do that subtraction. 56.67 minus 26.67 is 30. So, a - b is 30.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The total expenses are 500, each person's share is 166.67. Alan paid 110, so he needs to give 56.67. Beth paid 140, so she needs to give 26.67. Subtracting those gives 30. That seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me verify the total amount Chris should receive. Chris initially paid 190, which is more than his share of 166.67. So, Chris should receive back the difference. The difference is 190 minus 166.67, which is 23.33. But wait, if Alan gives Chris 56.67 and Beth gives Chris 26.67, the total Chris receives is 56.67 + 26.67, which is 83.34. But Chris should only receive 23.33. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Oh, I think I see the issue. The 60 picnic was an additional expense that wasn't included in the initial payments. So, when they realized they forgot the picnic, they need to split that 60 equally among the three of them. So, each person's share for the picnic is 60 divided by 3, which is 20. So, each person should pay an additional 20.Wait, so Alan paid 110, Beth paid 140, and Chris paid 190. But they also need to split the 60 picnic, so each person's total share is their initial payment plus 20. So, Alan's total share is 110 + 20 = 130, Beth's total share is 140 + 20 = 160, and Chris's total share is 190 + 20 = 210. But that doesn't make sense because the total expenses would then be 130 + 160 + 210 = 500, which is correct. But each person's share should be 166.67, not 130, 160, and 210.I think I'm confusing the way the picnic cost is being added. Let me try a different approach. The total expenses are 440 (from Alan, Beth, and Chris) plus 60 for the picnic, totaling 500. Each person's share is 500 divided by 3, which is approximately 166.67. So, Alan paid 110, so he needs to give Chris 56.67 to reach 166.67. Beth paid 140, so she needs to give Chris 26.67 to reach 166.67. Chris paid 190, which is 23.33 more than his share, so he should receive 23.33 in total. But according to the previous calculation, Alan and Beth are giving Chris 56.67 and 26.67, which totals 83.34, which is more than the 23.33 Chris should receive. This inconsistency suggests an error in my reasoning.Wait, perhaps the picnic cost should be distributed among all three, so each person's share increases by 20. So, Alan's total payment should be 110 + 20 = 130, Beth's total payment should be 140 + 20 = 160, and Chris's total payment should be 190 + 20 = 210. But then, the total would be 130 + 160 + 210 = 500, which is correct. However, each person's share is supposed to be 166.67, so Alan needs to pay an additional 36.67 (since 130 + 36.67 = 166.67), Beth needs to pay an additional 6.67 (since 160 + 6.67 = 166.67), and Chris has overpaid by 43.33 (since 210 - 43.33 = 166.67). Therefore, Alan needs to give Chris 36.67, and Beth needs to give Chris 6.67. So, a = 36.67 and b = 6.67, making a - b = 30. This aligns with the previous result.But wait, this seems conflicting with the initial approach. Let me clarify. The total expenses are 500, each person's share is 166.67. Alan paid 110, so he needs to give 56.67. Beth paid 140, so she needs to give 26.67. Chris paid 190, so he should receive 23.33. However, the total given by Alan and Beth is 56.67 + 26.67 = 83.34, which is more than the 23.33 Chris should receive. This discrepancy suggests that the initial approach might be incorrect.Perhaps the correct way is to consider that the picnic cost is an additional expense that needs to be split equally. So, each person's share increases by 20, making their new shares 130, 160, and 210. But since they initially paid 110, 140, and 190, the adjustments are as follows: Alan needs to pay an additional 20, Beth needs to pay an additional 20, and Chris needs to pay an additional 20. However, Chris has already paid 190, which is 20 more than his initial share of 170 (since 500 / 3 ≈ 166.67). Wait, this is getting confusing.Let me try another method. The total amount paid by Alan, Beth, and Chris is 110 + 140 + 190 = 440. They also had a picnic costing 60, so the total expenses are 500. Each person's share is 500 / 3 ≈ 166.67. Therefore, Alan needs to pay 166.67 - 110 = 56.67, Beth needs to pay 166.67 - 140 = 26.67, and Chris has overpaid by 190 - 166.67 = 23.33. So, Alan gives Chris 56.67, Beth gives Chris 26.67, and Chris receives a total of 83.34, which is 23.33 more than he should. This suggests that the picnic cost is being handled incorrectly.Wait, perhaps the picnic cost should be added to the total expenses, making each person's share 166.67. So, Alan needs to give 56.67, Beth needs to give 26.67, and Chris receives 83.34, which is 23.33 more than his share. This inconsistency indicates that the initial approach is flawed.I think the correct way is to consider that the picnic cost is an additional expense that needs to be split equally. So, each person's share is their initial payment plus 20 for the picnic. Therefore, Alan's total share is 110 + 20 = 130, Beth's is 140 + 20 = 160, and Chris's is 190 + 20 = 210. The total is 500, which is correct. Now, each person's share should be 166.67, so Alan needs to pay an additional 36.67 (since 130 + 36.67 = 166.67), Beth needs to pay an additional 6.67 (since 160 + 6.67 = 166.67), and Chris has overpaid by 43.33 (since 210 - 43.33 = 166.67). Therefore, Alan gives Chris 36.67, and Beth gives Chris 6.67, making a - b = 30.This seems consistent now.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the dot product of two vectors can be expressed in terms of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. The formula is:overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{b}| costhetaWhere θ is the angle between the vectors. So, I can plug in the values I have into this formula and solve for θ.Given:- |a| = 10- |b| = 12- a · b = -60So substituting these into the formula:-60 = 10 times 12 times costhetaLet me calculate 10 times 12 first. That's 120. So now the equation becomes:-60 = 120 costhetaTo solve for cosθ, I can divide both sides by 120:costheta = frac{-60}{120} = -0.5Okay, so cosθ is -0.5. Now I need to find the angle θ whose cosine is -0.5. I remember that cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants, but since the angle between two vectors is always between 0° and 180°, θ must be in the second quadrant.What angle has a cosine of -0.5? Let's recall the unit circle. Cosine of 60° is 0.5, so cosine of 120°, which is 180° - 60°, should be -0.5. Let me verify that.Yes, cos(120°) = cos(180° - 60°) = -cos(60°) = -0.5. So θ must be 120°.Looking back at the options, 120° is option B. So I think the answer is B.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.1. Start with the dot product formula: a · b = |a||b|cosθ.2. Plug in the given values: -60 = 10*12*cosθ.3. Simplify: -60 = 120cosθ.4. Divide both sides by 120: cosθ = -0.5.5. Determine θ: Since cosθ is -0.5 and θ is between 0° and 180°, θ is 120°.Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So I'm confident that the angle is 120°, which is option B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"18 men can complete a piece of work in 30 days.

I notice that there are terms with ( m ) and ( n ), so maybe completing the square could help here. Let me try that.Starting with the given equation:[ m^2 + n^2 + 4m - 46 = 0 ]I can group the ( m ) terms together:[ m^2 + 4m + n^2 - 46 = 0 ]Now, to complete the square for the ( m ) terms, I remember that the formula for completing the square is ( (x + a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 ). In this case, the coefficient of ( m ) is 4, so ( 2a = 4 ) which means ( a = 2 ).

Let's see:- ( 36 + 14 ) → 14 isn't a perfect square.- ( 25 + 25 ) is already covered.- ( 16 + 34 ) → 34 isn't a perfect square.- ( 9 + 41 ) → 41 isn't a perfect square.- ( 4 + 46 ) → 46 isn't a perfect square.- ( 1 + 49 ) → same as the first case.So, the only pairs are ( (7, 1) ) and ( (5, 5) ).Now, let's translate these back into values for ( m ) and ( n ).First pair: ( (m + 2) = 7 ) and ( n = 1 )- Solving for ( m ): ( m = 7 - 2 = 5 )- So, ( m = 5 ) and ( n = 1 )Second pair: ( (m + 2) = 5 ) and ( n = 5 )- Solving for ( m ): ( m = 5 - 2 = 3 )- So, ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 5 )Wait, could there be any other pairs? Let me think. If ( (m + 2) ) is 1, then ( n^2 = 49 ), but ( m ) would be ( 1 - 2 = -1 ), which isn't a positive integer. Similarly, if ( (m + 2) ) is 2, then ( n^2 = 50 - 4 = 46 ), which isn't a perfect square. So, no, only the two pairs I found earlier are valid.Now, let's compute ( mn ) for each case.First case: ( m = 5 ), ( n = 1 )- ( mn = 5 times 1 = 5 )Second case: ( m = 3 ), ( n = 5 )- ( mn = 3 times 5 = 15 )So, the possible values of ( mn ) are 5 and 15.Wait a second, the problem says \\"find the value of ( mn )\\", implying there might be a single answer. But in this case, there are two possible values. Maybe I need to check if both are valid.Let me plug them back into the original equation to verify.First case: ( m = 5 ), ( n = 1 )- ( m^2 + n^2 + 4m - 46 = 25 + 1 + 20 - 46 = 46 - 46 = 0 ) → Valid.Second case: ( m = 3 ), ( n = 5 )- ( m^2 + n^2 + 4m - 46 = 9 + 25 + 12 - 46 = 46 - 46 = 0 ) → Valid.Both solutions satisfy the equation. So, both are correct.But the problem asks for \\"the value of ( mn )\\", so perhaps both 5 and 15 are acceptable answers. However, sometimes problems expect all possible answers. Since the user didn't specify, I think it's safe to provide both.Wait, but in the initial problem statement, it just says \\"find the value of ( mn )\\", without specifying if it's unique or multiple. Maybe I should present both.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects both answers, so I should list both.Yeah, I think that's the right approach. So, the possible values of ( mn ) are 5 and 15.**Final Answer**The value of ( mn ) is either boxed{5} or boxed{15}."},{"question":"What is the difference between the sum of the first 3000 even counting numbers starting from 2 and the sum of the first 3000 odd counting numbers starting from 3?mathrm{(A)  } 0 qquad mathrm{(B)  } 3000 qquad mathrm{(C)  } -3000 qquad mathrm{(D)  } 6000 qquad mathrm{(E)  } 8997","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the difference between the sum of the first 3000 even counting numbers starting from 2 and the sum of the first 3000 odd counting numbers starting from 3. The options are given as (A) 0, (B) 3000, (C) -3000, (D) 6000, and (E) 8997. Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. I have two sequences: one of even numbers starting from 2, and another of odd numbers starting from 3. I need to find the sum of each of these sequences up to 3000 terms and then find the difference between these two sums.Let me recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series because both even and odd numbers form arithmetic sequences. The formula is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.Starting with the even numbers: the first term is 2, and the common difference is 2 because each subsequent even number is 2 more than the previous one. So, for the even numbers, a = 2, d = 2, and n = 3000.Plugging these into the formula: S_even = 3000/2 * (2*2 + (3000 - 1)*2). Let me compute that step by step.First, 3000 divided by 2 is 1500. Then, inside the parentheses: 2*2 is 4, and (3000 - 1)*2 is 2999*2, which is 5998. Adding those together: 4 + 5998 = 6002. So, S_even = 1500 * 6002.Let me calculate 1500 * 6002. Well, 1500 * 6000 is 9,000,000, and 1500 * 2 is 3,000. So, adding those together, S_even = 9,000,000 + 3,000 = 9,003,000.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. 1500 * 6002. Hmm, 1500 * 6000 is indeed 9,000,000, and 1500 * 2 is 3,000. So, yes, 9,000,000 + 3,000 is 9,003,000. Okay, that seems correct.Now, moving on to the odd numbers. The first term is 3, and the common difference is also 2 because each odd number is 2 more than the previous one. So, for the odd numbers, a = 3, d = 2, and n = 3000.Using the same formula: S_odd = 3000/2 * (2*3 + (3000 - 1)*2). Let me compute this step by step as well.3000 divided by 2 is 1500. Inside the parentheses: 2*3 is 6, and (3000 - 1)*2 is 2999*2, which is 5998. Adding those together: 6 + 5998 = 6004. So, S_odd = 1500 * 6004.Calculating 1500 * 6004: 1500 * 6000 is 9,000,000, and 1500 * 4 is 6,000. Adding those together, S_odd = 9,000,000 + 6,000 = 9,006,000.Wait a second, that seems a bit high. Let me verify. 1500 * 6004: Yes, 1500 * 6000 is 9,000,000, and 1500 * 4 is 6,000. So, 9,000,000 + 6,000 is indeed 9,006,000. Okay, that checks out.Now, I need to find the difference between the sum of the even numbers and the sum of the odd numbers. That is, S_even - S_odd.So, S_even is 9,003,000, and S_odd is 9,006,000. Therefore, the difference is 9,003,000 - 9,006,000.Calculating that: 9,003,000 - 9,006,000 is -3,000.Hmm, so the difference is -3,000. Looking back at the options, (C) is -3000, so that must be the answer.But let me think again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should consider another approach to verify.Alternatively, I can think about the difference between corresponding terms of the two sequences. The first even number is 2, and the first odd number is 3. The difference between them is 2 - 3 = -1. The second even number is 4, and the second odd number is 5. The difference is 4 - 5 = -1. Similarly, each pair of corresponding terms has a difference of -1.Since there are 3000 terms, the total difference would be 3000 * (-1) = -3000. That confirms my earlier result.So, yes, the difference is -3000, which corresponds to option (C).**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"A train 125 m long, traveling at 45 km/hr, can cross a bridge of 250 m in a certain time.

Determine the maximum area of the resulting cross-section.","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum area of a cross-section when I cut a regular tetrahedron with a plane that's parallel to two opposite edges. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a regular tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal in length, and every face is congruent.Now, the problem mentions cutting the tetrahedron with a plane that's parallel to two opposite edges. I need to visualize this. Let me imagine a regular tetrahedron. Let's label its vertices as A, B, C, and D. Each pair of opposite edges would be edges that don't intersect and aren't adjacent. For example, edges AB and CD are opposite edges because they don't share a common vertex.So, if I'm cutting the tetrahedron with a plane parallel to AB and CD, the cross-section created by this plane will be a polygon. Since the plane is parallel to two edges, the cross-section should be a quadrilateral, right? Because the plane will intersect four edges of the tetrahedron.Wait, actually, in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, so if I cut it with a plane, the cross-section can be a triangle or a quadrilateral depending on how the plane intersects the edges. But since the plane is parallel to two opposite edges, it should intersect the other four edges, forming a quadrilateral. So, the cross-section is a quadrilateral.Now, I need to determine the maximum area of this quadrilateral. To do that, I should probably figure out the shape of this quadrilateral and express its area in terms of the edge length of the tetrahedron. Then, I can find the maximum area by optimizing the parameters.Let me denote the edge length of the regular tetrahedron as 'a'. Since it's regular, all edges are length 'a'. Now, let's think about the plane cutting the tetrahedron parallel to two opposite edges. Let's say the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD. Then, the cross-section will be a quadrilateral, and its sides will be parallel to AB and CD.Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the cross-section should also be a parallelogram. Wait, is that correct? Because if two sides are parallel to AB and the other two sides are parallel to CD, then yes, it should be a parallelogram. But is it a rectangle or a rhombus or just a general parallelogram?Hmm, in a regular tetrahedron, the edges AB and CD are skew lines, meaning they don't lie in the same plane and don't intersect. So, the plane cutting the tetrahedron parallel to both AB and CD would create a parallelogram cross-section. But since all edges of the tetrahedron are equal, the cross-section might have some symmetry.Wait, maybe it's a square? Because all edges are equal, and the plane is equidistant from both AB and CD. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think more carefully.Let me try to parameterize the position of the cutting plane. Suppose I move the plane from one end of the tetrahedron towards the other, keeping it parallel to AB and CD. As the plane moves, the cross-sectional area changes. At some point, the area will be maximized.To model this, I can consider the height of the tetrahedron and how the cross-sectional area varies with height. The height of a regular tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:Height (h) = √(2/3) * aBut I need to think about how the cross-sectional area changes as I move the plane along this height. Since the plane is parallel to two opposite edges, the cross-section will vary in size depending on where the plane is located.Let me try to find the relationship between the position of the plane and the area of the cross-section. Let's denote the distance from the base of the tetrahedron to the cutting plane as 'x'. Then, the cross-sectional area will be a function of 'x'.But wait, since the plane is parallel to two opposite edges, maybe it's better to parameterize it differently. Instead of using the height, perhaps I can use the ratio of the lengths along the edges where the plane intersects.Let me consider the edges that are not parallel to the cutting plane. These are the edges that the plane will intersect. For example, if the plane is parallel to AB and CD, it will intersect edges AC, AD, BC, and BD.Let me denote the points where the plane intersects these edges as E, F, G, and H, respectively. So, E is on AC, F is on AD, G is on BC, and H is on BD.Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the segments EF and GH will be parallel to AB and CD, respectively. Also, the segments EG and FH will be parallel to each other as well.Wait, actually, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, which are skew lines, the cross-section should be a parallelogram. So, EF is parallel to GH, and EG is parallel to FH.Now, to find the area of this parallelogram, I can use the formula:Area = base * heightBut I need to figure out what the base and height are in terms of the edge length 'a' and the position of the plane.Alternatively, since it's a parallelogram, the area can also be calculated using the cross product of two adjacent sides.But maybe it's easier to use similar triangles. Since the plane is cutting the edges proportionally, the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram will be proportional to the position of the plane.Let me denote the ratio of the distance from the vertex to the cutting plane as 'k'. So, if I take vertex A, the distance from A to the cutting plane is 'k' times the height of the tetrahedron. Similarly, the distance from the opposite vertex (let's say C) to the cutting plane would be (1 - k) times the height.But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe I should use coordinates to model the tetrahedron and find the cross-section.Let me assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron. Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0), vertex B at (a, 0, 0), vertex C at (a/2, (√3/2)a, 0), and vertex D at (a/2, (√3/6)a, (√6/3)a). This way, the base ABC is an equilateral triangle in the xy-plane, and vertex D is above the base.Now, the edges AB and CD are opposite edges. Edge AB goes from (0, 0, 0) to (a, 0, 0), and edge CD goes from (a/2, (√3/2)a, 0) to (a/2, (√3/6)a, (√6/3)a).I need to find a plane that's parallel to both AB and CD. To find such a plane, I can determine its normal vector. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the normal vector should be perpendicular to both AB and CD.First, let's find the direction vectors of AB and CD.Vector AB = B - A = (a, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 0) = (a, 0, 0)Vector CD = D - C = (a/2, (√3/6)a, (√6/3)a) - (a/2, (√3/2)a, 0) = (0, -(√3/3)a, (√6/3)a)So, vector AB is (a, 0, 0) and vector CD is (0, -(√3/3)a, (√6/3)a).Now, the normal vector to the plane should be perpendicular to both AB and CD. So, we can find the normal vector by taking the cross product of AB and CD.Let me compute the cross product:AB × CD = |i   j   k|             a   0   0             0 -(√3/3)a (√6/3)a= i*(0*(√6/3)a - 0*(-√3/3)a) - j*(a*(√6/3)a - 0*0) + k*(a*(-√3/3)a - 0*0)= i*(0 - 0) - j*( (√6/3)a² - 0 ) + k*( (-√3/3)a² - 0 )= 0i - (√6/3)a² j - (√3/3)a² kSo, the normal vector is (0, -√6/3 a², -√3/3 a²). We can simplify this by dividing by a², giving (0, -√6/3, -√3/3). To make it a unit normal vector, we can normalize it, but maybe we don't need to for this purpose.Now, the equation of the plane can be written as:0(x - x0) - √6/3 (y - y0) - √3/3 (z - z0) = 0But since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, it doesn't pass through any specific point yet. We need to define the plane such that it cuts the tetrahedron. To find the cross-section, we need to find the intersection points of this plane with the edges of the tetrahedron.Wait, maybe instead of using coordinates, I can think more geometrically. Since the plane is parallel to two opposite edges, the cross-section will be a parallelogram, as we established earlier. The area of this parallelogram depends on the distance between the two opposite edges and the angle between them.But in a regular tetrahedron, the distance between two opposite edges can be calculated. Let me recall that the distance between two skew lines can be found using the formula:Distance = |(P2 - P1) · (n)| / |n|Where P1 and P2 are points on the two lines, and n is the cross product of the direction vectors of the lines.In our case, the two opposite edges are AB and CD. Let's take points A(0,0,0) on AB and C(a/2, (√3/2)a, 0) on CD. The vector AC is (a/2, (√3/2)a, 0). The direction vectors of AB and CD are AB = (a, 0, 0) and CD = (0, -(√3/3)a, (√6/3)a), as before.We already computed the cross product AB × CD = (0, -√6/3 a², -√3/3 a²). The magnitude of this cross product is:|AB × CD| = sqrt( (0)^2 + (-√6/3 a²)^2 + (-√3/3 a²)^2 ) = sqrt( (6/9 a^4) + (3/9 a^4) ) = sqrt( (9/9 a^4) ) = a²So, the distance between AB and CD is |AC · (AB × CD)| / |AB × CD|First, compute AC · (AB × CD):AC = (a/2, (√3/2)a, 0)AB × CD = (0, -√6/3 a², -√3/3 a²)Dot product = (a/2)*0 + ( (√3/2)a )*(-√6/3 a²) + 0*(-√3/3 a²) = 0 - (√3 * √6 / 6) a³ + 0 = - (√18 / 6) a³ = - (3√2 / 6) a³ = - (√2 / 2) a³Taking the absolute value, we get | -√2 / 2 a³ | = √2 / 2 a³Then, the distance is (√2 / 2 a³) / a² = √2 / 2 aSo, the distance between the two opposite edges AB and CD is √2 / 2 a.Now, the cross-section is a parallelogram whose area is base * height. The base can be considered as the length of one of the sides, say, the length of AB, which is 'a'. The height would then be the distance between the two opposite edges, which we just found as √2 / 2 a.Wait, but that would give an area of a * (√2 / 2 a) = √2 / 2 a². But I'm not sure if that's correct because the cross-section is not necessarily aligned in that way.Alternatively, maybe the area of the parallelogram is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of its adjacent sides. If we can express the vectors defining the sides of the parallelogram, then the area would be the magnitude of their cross product.But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.Since the cross-section is a parallelogram, its area can also be expressed as the product of the lengths of two adjacent sides multiplied by the sine of the angle between them.But to find the maximum area, I need to find the orientation of the plane where this area is maximized.Wait, actually, since the plane is parallel to two fixed edges, the angle between the sides of the parallelogram is fixed. Therefore, the area would be maximized when the lengths of the sides are maximized.But the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram depend on where the plane cuts the tetrahedron. If the plane is too close to one of the edges, the cross-section becomes smaller. So, there must be an optimal position where the cross-sectional area is maximized.Let me try to parameterize the position of the plane. Let's say the plane is at a certain height 'h' from the base ABC. As the plane moves up from the base, the cross-sectional area changes. I need to express the area as a function of 'h' and then find its maximum.But how does 'h' relate to the position of the plane? Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, moving it up changes the position where it intersects the other edges.Wait, maybe instead of using height, I can use a parameter 't' which represents the fraction along the edge from the base to the opposite vertex. For example, if t = 0, the plane is at the base ABC, and as t increases to 1, the plane moves towards the opposite vertex D.But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe I should use similar triangles.When the plane cuts the tetrahedron, it creates a smaller, similar tetrahedron on top and a frustum-like shape below. But since the plane is parallel to two edges, the cross-section isn't a similar tetrahedron but a parallelogram.Wait, perhaps I can consider the ratios of the segments where the plane intersects the edges.Let me denote the intersection points on edges AC, AD, BC, and BD as E, F, G, and H, respectively. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the ratios of the segments on these edges should be the same.Let me denote the ratio as 'k', so that AE = k * AC, AF = k * AD, BG = k * BC, and BH = k * BD.Since AC, AD, BC, and BD are all edges of the tetrahedron, their lengths are all 'a'. Therefore, AE = AF = BG = BH = k * a.Then, the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram cross-section would be proportional to 'k'. Specifically, the lengths of EF and GH would be k * a, and the lengths of EG and FH would be something else.Wait, actually, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the lengths of EF and GH should be equal to the lengths of AB and CD, but scaled by 'k'. But AB and CD are both length 'a', so EF and GH would be k * a.But that doesn't seem right because the plane is cutting through the tetrahedron, so the lengths should be less than 'a'.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of vectors. Let me consider the vectors defining the sides of the parallelogram.Vector EF would be parallel to AB, so it would have the same direction as AB but scaled by 'k'. Similarly, vector EG would be parallel to CD, scaled by some factor.But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use coordinates to find the exact points of intersection.Let me go back to the coordinate system I set up earlier:A = (0, 0, 0)B = (a, 0, 0)C = (a/2, (√3/2)a, 0)D = (a/2, (√3/6)a, (√6/3)a)Now, the plane is parallel to AB and CD. Let me find the equation of such a plane.Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, it must contain a direction vector parallel to AB and another parallel to CD. So, the normal vector of the plane is perpendicular to both AB and CD, which we already computed as (0, -√6/3, -√3/3).But to define the plane, we need a specific point on the plane. Let's assume the plane intersects edge AC at point E and edge BC at point G. Let me parameterize these points.Let me denote the parameter 't' such that E divides AC in the ratio t:(1 - t), so E = A + t*(C - A) = (t*a/2, t*(√3/2)a, 0)Similarly, G divides BC in the ratio t:(1 - t), so G = B + t*(C - B) = (a - t*a/2, t*(√3/2)a, 0)Now, since the plane passes through E and G, and is parallel to AB and CD, we can find its equation.Wait, actually, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, and passes through E and G, we can find two direction vectors in the plane: one parallel to AB, which is (a, 0, 0), and another parallel to CD, which is (0, -(√3/3)a, (√6/3)a). But since the plane passes through E and G, we can write its equation accordingly.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the equation of the plane using the normal vector and a point on the plane.We have the normal vector n = (0, -√6/3, -√3/3). Let's take point E = (t*a/2, t*(√3/2)a, 0) on the plane.The equation of the plane is:0*(x - t*a/2) - √6/3*(y - t*(√3/2)a) - √3/3*(z - 0) = 0Simplifying:-√6/3*(y - t*(√3/2)a) - √3/3*z = 0Multiply through by 3 to eliminate denominators:-√6*(y - t*(√3/2)a) - √3*z = 0Expanding:-√6*y + √6*t*(√3/2)a - √3*z = 0Simplify the terms:√6*t*(√3/2)a = t*(√18/2)a = t*(3√2/2)aSo, the equation becomes:-√6*y + (3√2/2)*t*a - √3*z = 0Now, we can write this as:√6*y + √3*z = (3√2/2)*t*aThis is the equation of the plane.Now, we need to find the intersection points of this plane with the other edges of the tetrahedron, namely edges AD and BD.Let's find the intersection with edge AD. Edge AD goes from A(0,0,0) to D(a/2, (√3/6)a, (√6/3)a). Let's parameterize edge AD as:AD: (0 + s*(a/2), 0 + s*(√3/6)a, 0 + s*(√6/3)a), where s ∈ [0,1]So, any point on AD can be written as (s*a/2, s*(√3/6)a, s*(√6/3)a)Plugging this into the plane equation:√6*(s*(√3/6)a) + √3*(s*(√6/3)a) = (3√2/2)*t*aSimplify each term:√6*(s*(√3/6)a) = s*(√6*√3)/6 *a = s*(√18)/6 *a = s*(3√2)/6 *a = s*(√2/2)*a√3*(s*(√6/3)a) = s*(√3*√6)/3 *a = s*(√18)/3 *a = s*(3√2)/3 *a = s*√2*aSo, the left side becomes:s*(√2/2)*a + s*√2*a = s*(√2/2 + √2)*a = s*( (1/2 + 1)√2 )*a = s*(3/2 √2)*aSet equal to the right side:s*(3/2 √2)*a = (3√2/2)*t*aDivide both sides by (3√2/2)*a:s = tSo, the intersection point F on AD is when s = t, so F = (t*a/2, t*(√3/6)a, t*(√6/3)a)Similarly, let's find the intersection with edge BD. Edge BD goes from B(a,0,0) to D(a/2, (√3/6)a, (√6/3)a). Let's parameterize edge BD as:BD: (a - s*(a/2), 0 + s*(√3/6)a, 0 + s*(√6/3)a), where s ∈ [0,1]So, any point on BD can be written as (a - s*a/2, s*(√3/6)a, s*(√6/3)a)Plugging this into the plane equation:√6*(s*(√3/6)a) + √3*(s*(√6/3)a) = (3√2/2)*t*aWait, this looks similar to the previous calculation. Let's compute each term:√6*(s*(√3/6)a) = s*(√6*√3)/6 *a = s*(√18)/6 *a = s*(3√2)/6 *a = s*(√2/2)*a√3*(s*(√6/3)a) = s*(√3*√6)/3 *a = s*(√18)/3 *a = s*(3√2)/3 *a = s*√2*aSo, the left side becomes:s*(√2/2)*a + s*√2*a = s*(√2/2 + √2)*a = s*(3/2 √2)*aSet equal to the right side:s*(3/2 √2)*a = (3√2/2)*t*aDivide both sides by (3√2/2)*a:s = tSo, the intersection point H on BD is when s = t, so H = (a - t*a/2, t*(√3/6)a, t*(√6/3)a)Now, we have all four intersection points:E = (t*a/2, t*(√3/2)a, 0)F = (t*a/2, t*(√3/6)a, t*(√6/3)a)G = (a - t*a/2, t*(√3/2)a, 0)H = (a - t*a/2, t*(√3/6)a, t*(√6/3)a)Now, let's find the vectors defining the sides of the parallelogram EFGH.Vector EF = F - E = (0, -t*(√3/3)a, t*(√6/3)a)Vector EG = G - E = (a - t*a, 0, 0)Wait, let me compute these vectors correctly.Vector EF = F - E = (t*a/2 - t*a/2, t*(√3/6)a - t*(√3/2)a, t*(√6/3)a - 0) = (0, -t*(√3/3)a, t*(√6/3)a)Vector EG = G - E = (a - t*a/2 - t*a/2, t*(√3/2)a - t*(√3/2)a, 0 - 0) = (a - t*a, 0, 0)So, vector EF = (0, -t*(√3/3)a, t*(√6/3)a)Vector EG = (a*(1 - t), 0, 0)Now, the area of the parallelogram is the magnitude of the cross product of vectors EF and EG.Compute EF × EG:EF = (0, -t*(√3/3)a, t*(√6/3)a)EG = (a*(1 - t), 0, 0)Cross product:|i   j   k||0 -t√3/3 a t√6/3 a||a(1 - t) 0 0|= i*( (-t√3/3 a)*0 - t√6/3 a*0 ) - j*(0*0 - t√6/3 a*a(1 - t)) + k*(0*0 - (-t√3/3 a)*a(1 - t))Simplify each component:i-component: 0 - 0 = 0j-component: - (0 - t√6/3 a * a(1 - t)) = - ( - t√6/3 a² (1 - t) ) = t√6/3 a² (1 - t)k-component: 0 - (-t√3/3 a * a(1 - t)) = t√3/3 a² (1 - t)So, the cross product is:(0, t√6/3 a² (1 - t), t√3/3 a² (1 - t))The magnitude of this cross product is:sqrt( (0)^2 + (t√6/3 a² (1 - t))^2 + (t√3/3 a² (1 - t))^2 )= sqrt( (6/9 t² a^4 (1 - t)^2 ) + (3/9 t² a^4 (1 - t)^2 ) )= sqrt( (6/9 + 3/9) t² a^4 (1 - t)^2 )= sqrt( (9/9) t² a^4 (1 - t)^2 )= sqrt( t² a^4 (1 - t)^2 )= t a² (1 - t)Since t is between 0 and 1, t a² (1 - t) is non-negative.Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is t a² (1 - t).So, the area A(t) = t a² (1 - t) = a² t (1 - t)To find the maximum area, we can treat this as a quadratic function in terms of t. The function A(t) = a² t (1 - t) is a downward-opening parabola with roots at t = 0 and t = 1. The maximum occurs at the vertex, which is at t = (0 + 1)/2 = 1/2.So, the maximum area is when t = 1/2, and the area is:A(1/2) = a² * (1/2) * (1 - 1/2) = a² * (1/2) * (1/2) = a² / 4Therefore, the maximum cross-sectional area is a² / 4.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.We found that the area is A(t) = a² t (1 - t), which is a quadratic function with maximum at t = 1/2, giving A = a² / 4.Yes, that makes sense. So, the maximum area of the cross-section is a² / 4.But let me think about the shape of the cross-section when t = 1/2. At t = 1/2, the plane is cutting the tetrahedron exactly halfway along each edge. So, the cross-section should be a square because all sides would be equal.Wait, is that correct? Let me see.At t = 1/2, the points E, F, G, H are midpoints of their respective edges. So, the cross-section is a parallelogram with sides equal to half the length of AB and CD, but since AB and CD are both length 'a', the sides of the parallelogram would be a/2.But wait, in our earlier calculation, the area was a² / 4, which would be the area of a square with side length a/2. So, yes, the cross-section is a square with side length a/2, giving an area of a² / 4.Therefore, the maximum cross-sectional area is indeed a² / 4.I think that's the answer. To summarize, by parameterizing the position of the plane and calculating the area of the resulting parallelogram, we found that the area is maximized when the plane is halfway along the edges, resulting in a square cross-section with area a² / 4."},{"question":"In the parallelepiped ABCD-A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1}, where AB=2, AD=2, AA_{1}=4, angle BAD=angle BAA_{1}=angle DAA_{1}=60^{circ}, the sine value of the angle formed by BC_{1} and CA_{1} is ( ).A: frac{sqrt{21}}{42}B: frac{sqrt{3}}{42}C: frac{sqrt{21}}{14}D: frac{5sqrt{7}}{14}","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a parallelepiped, which is like a 3D figure with six faces, each of which is a parallelogram. The specific parallelepiped is labeled ABCD-A₁B₁C₁D₁. The given information includes the lengths of some edges and some angles between them. I need to find the sine of the angle formed by two specific lines: BC₁ and CA₁.First, let me parse the given information:- AB = 2- AD = 2- AA₁ = 4- The angles BAD, BAA₁, and DAA₁ are all 60 degrees.So, I'm dealing with a parallelepiped where three edges meeting at vertex A have lengths 2, 2, and 4, and the angles between each pair of these edges are all 60 degrees. That seems like a pretty symmetric setup, but since it's a parallelepiped, the opposite faces are parallelograms, but not necessarily cubes or even rectangular boxes.I need to find the sine of the angle between vectors BC₁ and CA₁. Hmm, okay. So, I think the best approach here is to use vectors to represent these lines and then use the dot product formula to find the angle between them. Once I have the cosine of the angle, I can find the sine using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.First, let me assign coordinates to the vertices to make this more concrete. Let's place vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since AB = 2 and angle BAD is 60 degrees, I can represent vector AB and vector AD in 3D space.But wait, since all three angles at A (BAD, BAA₁, DAA₁) are 60 degrees, this suggests that the edges AB, AD, and AA₁ are all at 60 degrees to each other. So, this is like a three-dimensional coordinate system where each axis is at 60 degrees to the others. That might complicate things a bit, but perhaps I can use vectors with these angles to define the coordinates.Let me denote:- Vector AB as vector **b**- Vector AD as vector **d**- Vector AA₁ as vector **a**Given that AB = 2, AD = 2, and AA₁ = 4, and all angles between these vectors are 60 degrees.So, the dot product between any two different vectors (e.g., **b** · **d**) will be |**b**||**d**|cosθ = 2*2*cos60° = 2*2*(0.5) = 2.Similarly, **b** · **a** = |**b**||**a**|cos60° = 2*4*0.5 = 4.And **d** · **a** = |**d**||**a**|cos60° = 2*4*0.5 = 4.Okay, so now I can express vectors BC₁ and CA₁ in terms of these vectors.First, vector BC₁. Let's see, point B is connected to point C₁. So, in terms of vectors, BC₁ would be the vector from B to C₁. Since in a parallelepiped, moving from B to C₁ would involve moving along the edges from B to C and then from C to C₁. But wait, actually, in a parallelepiped, the edges are vectors, so BC₁ can be expressed as the sum of vectors BC and CC₁. But BC is equal to AD because opposite edges in a parallelepiped are equal and parallel. Similarly, CC₁ is equal to AA₁.Wait, let me think again. Maybe it's better to express BC₁ directly in terms of vectors from A.Since B is A + **b**, and C₁ is the vertex diagonally opposite to C in the upper base. So, to get from B to C₁, we can go from B to A (which is -**b**) and then from A to C₁. But from A to C₁, it's the vector AC₁, which is **d** + **a**. So, BC₁ = -**b** + **d** + **a**.Alternatively, since in a parallelepiped, BC₁ can be expressed as the vector from B to C₁, which is equivalent to the vector from A to C₁ minus the vector from A to B. So, BC₁ = AC₁ - AB = (**d** + **a**) - **b**.Similarly, vector CA₁ is the vector from C to A₁. Point C is A + **b** + **d**, and A₁ is A + **a**. So, vector CA₁ is A₁ - C = (**a**) - (**b** + **d**) = **a** - **b** - **d**.So, now I have:- Vector BC₁ = **a** - **b** + **d**- Vector CA₁ = **a** - **b** - **d**Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If BC₁ is from B to C₁, and B is at A + **b**, and C₁ is at A + **b** + **d** + **a**? Wait, no. In a parallelepiped, each vertex can be expressed as combinations of the vectors **a**, **b**, and **d**. So, point C is A + **b** + **d**, and point C₁ is A + **b** + **d** + **a**. Therefore, vector BC₁ is C₁ - B = (A + **b** + **d** + **a**) - (A + **b**) = **d** + **a**.Similarly, vector CA₁ is A₁ - C = (A + **a**) - (A + **b** + **d**) = **a** - **b** - **d**.So, correcting myself, vector BC₁ is **a** + **d**, and vector CA₁ is **a** - **b** - **d**.Okay, that seems better. So, BC₁ = **a** + **d**, and CA₁ = **a** - **b** - **d**.Now, to find the angle between vectors BC₁ and CA₁, I can use the dot product formula:cosθ = (BC₁ · CA₁) / (|BC₁| |CA₁|)Once I have cosθ, I can find sinθ using sinθ = sqrt(1 - cos²θ).So, first, let's compute the dot product BC₁ · CA₁.Given that BC₁ = **a** + **d** and CA₁ = **a** - **b** - **d**, their dot product is:(**a** + **d**) · (**a** - **b** - **d**) = **a**·**a** - **a**·**b** - **a**·**d** + **d**·**a** - **d**·**b** - **d**·**d**Simplify term by term:- **a**·**a** = |**a**|² = 4² = 16- **a**·**b** = 4*2*cos60° = 4*2*0.5 = 4- **a**·**d** = same as **a**·**b**, which is 4- **d**·**a** = same as **a**·**d**, which is 4- **d**·**b** = 2*2*cos60° = 2*2*0.5 = 2- **d**·**d** = |**d**|² = 2² = 4Putting it all together:16 - 4 - 4 + 4 - 2 - 4 = 16 - 4 - 4 + 4 - 2 - 4Let's compute step by step:Start with 16.16 - 4 = 1212 - 4 = 88 + 4 = 1212 - 2 = 1010 - 4 = 6So, the dot product BC₁ · CA₁ is 6.Next, compute the magnitudes of BC₁ and CA₁.First, |BC₁|:BC₁ = **a** + **d**|BC₁|² = (**a** + **d**)·(**a** + **d**) = **a**·**a** + 2**a**·**d** + **d**·**d** = 16 + 2*4 + 4 = 16 + 8 + 4 = 28So, |BC₁| = sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7)Next, |CA₁|:CA₁ = **a** - **b** - **d**|CA₁|² = (**a** - **b** - **d**)·(**a** - **b** - **d**) = **a**·**a** - 2**a**·**b** - 2**a**·**d** + **b**·**b** + 2**b**·**d** + **d**·**d**Compute each term:- **a**·**a** = 16- **a**·**b** = 4- **a**·**d** = 4- **b**·**b** = |**b**|² = 4- **b**·**d** = 2- **d**·**d** = 4Plugging in:16 - 2*4 - 2*4 + 4 + 2*2 + 4Compute step by step:16 - 8 - 8 + 4 + 4 + 416 - 8 = 88 - 8 = 00 + 4 = 44 + 4 = 88 + 4 = 12So, |CA₁|² = 12, hence |CA₁| = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3)Now, we have:cosθ = (6) / (2*sqrt(7) * 2*sqrt(3)) = 6 / (4*sqrt(21)) = (6)/(4*sqrt(21)) = (3)/(2*sqrt(21))Simplify this:Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):(3*sqrt(21))/(2*21) = (3*sqrt(21))/42 = sqrt(21)/14Wait, hold on. 3/42 is 1/14, so sqrt(21)/14.Wait, but let me double-check:cosθ = 6 / (2*sqrt(7)*2*sqrt(3)) = 6 / (4*sqrt(21)) = (6/4)/sqrt(21) = (3/2)/sqrt(21) = 3/(2*sqrt(21)).Yes, that's correct. So, cosθ = 3/(2*sqrt(21)).Now, to find sinθ, we can use sinθ = sqrt(1 - cos²θ).Compute cos²θ:(3/(2*sqrt(21)))² = 9 / (4*21) = 9 / 84 = 3 / 28So, sin²θ = 1 - 3/28 = 25/28Therefore, sinθ = sqrt(25/28) = 5/sqrt(28) = 5*sqrt(28)/28 = 5*2*sqrt(7)/28 = 10*sqrt(7)/28 = 5*sqrt(7)/14So, sinθ = 5*sqrt(7)/14Looking back at the options:A: sqrt(21)/42B: sqrt(3)/42C: sqrt(21)/14D: 5*sqrt(7)/14So, the answer is D.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.Let me recap:- Expressed BC₁ and CA₁ in terms of vectors **a**, **b**, **d**.- Calculated the dot product: 6- Calculated |BC₁|: 2*sqrt(7)- Calculated |CA₁|: 2*sqrt(3)- Then, cosθ = 6 / (2*sqrt(7)*2*sqrt(3)) = 6 / (4*sqrt(21)) = 3/(2*sqrt(21)) = sqrt(21)/14 after rationalizing.Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. When I rationalized 3/(2*sqrt(21)), I should have multiplied numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):3/(2*sqrt(21)) * (sqrt(21)/sqrt(21)) = 3*sqrt(21)/(2*21) = 3*sqrt(21)/42 = sqrt(21)/14Wait, so cosθ = sqrt(21)/14, not 3/(2*sqrt(21)).But earlier, I thought that cosθ was 3/(2*sqrt(21)), which is equal to sqrt(21)/14.Wait, let me compute 3/(2*sqrt(21)):Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):3*sqrt(21)/(2*21) = 3*sqrt(21)/42 = sqrt(21)/14Yes, that's correct. So, cosθ = sqrt(21)/14.Then, sin²θ = 1 - (sqrt(21)/14)² = 1 - 21/196 = (196 - 21)/196 = 175/196 = 25/28Therefore, sinθ = 5/sqrt(28) = 5*sqrt(28)/28 = 5*2*sqrt(7)/28 = 10*sqrt(7)/28 = 5*sqrt(7)/14Yes, that's correct.So, the sine of the angle is 5*sqrt(7)/14, which is option D.I think that's solid. I don't see any calculation errors in my steps. So, I'm confident the answer is D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Solve for the number of distinct real solutions to the equation |x - |3x - 2|| = 5.mathrm{(A)  }0 qquad mathrm{(B)  }1 qquad mathrm{(C)  } 2 qquad mathrm{(D)  }3 qquad mathrm{(E)  } 4","answer":"Okay, so I need to solve the equation |x - |3x - 2|| = 5. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes be tricky because of the cases involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, I know that absolute value expressions can be split into different cases depending on whether the inside is positive or negative. So, let me start by looking at the inner absolute value, which is |3x - 2|. I can consider two cases for |3x - 2|:1. **Case 1:** When 3x - 2 is non-negative, which means 3x - 2 ≥ 0. Solving this inequality gives x ≥ 2/3. In this case, |3x - 2| = 3x - 2.2. **Case 2:** When 3x - 2 is negative, which means 3x - 2 < 0. Solving this gives x < 2/3. Here, |3x - 2| = -(3x - 2) = -3x + 2.Okay, so now I can substitute these expressions back into the original equation for each case.**Case 1: x ≥ 2/3**Substituting |3x - 2| = 3x - 2 into the original equation:|x - (3x - 2)| = 5Simplify inside the absolute value:|x - 3x + 2| = 5|-2x + 2| = 5Now, this absolute value equation can be split into two equations:1. -2x + 2 = 52. -2x + 2 = -5Let me solve each of these.**Equation 1: -2x + 2 = 5**Subtract 2 from both sides:-2x = 3Divide both sides by -2:x = -3/2Wait, but in this case, we assumed x ≥ 2/3. However, x = -3/2 is approximately -1.5, which is less than 2/3. So this solution doesn't satisfy the condition for Case 1. Therefore, we discard this solution.**Equation 2: -2x + 2 = -5**Subtract 2 from both sides:-2x = -7Divide both sides by -2:x = 7/2Now, 7/2 is 3.5, which is greater than 2/3. So this solution is valid for Case 1.

But in this case, we assumed x < 2/3. So, x = 7/4 doesn't satisfy the condition for Case 2. Therefore, we discard this solution.**Equation 2: 4x - 2 = -5**Add 2 to both sides:4x = -3Divide both sides by 4:x = -3/4Now, -3/4 is -0.75, which is less than 2/3.

Which matches the equation.**Checking x = -3/4:**Compute |3x - 2|:3*(-3/4) - 2 = -9/4 - 8/4 = -17/4So, |x - |3x - 2|| = |-3/4 - (-17/4)| = |-3/4 + 17/4| = |14/4| = |3.5| = 3.5. Wait, that's 7/2, which is 3.5, not 5. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?Wait, let me recalculate.Wait, |3x - 2| when x = -3/4:3*(-3/4) - 2 = -9/4 - 8/4 = (-9 - 8)/4 = -17/4. So, |3x - 2| = |-17/4| = 17/4.Then, |x - |3x - 2|| = |-3/4 - 17/4| = |-20/4| = |-5| = 5. Oh, I see, I made a mistake in the previous step. It should be |-3/4 - 17/4|, not |-3/4 - (-17/4)|.

Hmm, okay. So, I guess I need to solve the equation f(x) = 3 for both cases of the piecewise function and then find the maximum integer solution from those results.Let me start with the first case where x < 1. In this case, f(x) = -2x + 1. So, I set that equal to 3:-2x + 1 = 3.Now, I need to solve for x. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:-2x = 2.Then, dividing both sides by -2:x = -1.Okay, so x = -1 is a solution in this case. But I need to check if it's valid because this case is only for x < 1.

Only x = 3 is a valid solution in this case.So, from both cases, I have two solutions: x = -1 and x = 3.

Let me check that:- (27x^6 = (3x^2)^3) because ((3x^2)^3 = 3^3 cdot (x^2)^3 = 27x^6).- (512y^6 = (8y^2)^3) because ((8y^2)^3 = 8^3 cdot (y^2)^3 = 512y^6).Okay, so that means I can rewrite the original expression as:[(3x^2)^3 - (8y^2)^3]Now, I recall that there's a formula for the difference of cubes, which is:[a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)]So, if I let (a = 3x^2) and (b = 8y^2), then applying the formula should give me the factorization. Let's try that:[(3x^2)^3 - (8y^2)^3 = (3x^2 - 8y^2)left((3x^2)^2 + (3x^2)(8y^2) + (8y^2)^2right)]Simplifying each term inside the second parenthesis:- ((3x^2)^2 = 9x^4)- ((3x^2)(8y^2) = 24x^2y^2)- ((8y^2)^2 = 64y^4)So, putting it all together, the factorization becomes:[(3x^2 - 8y^2)(9x^4 + 24x^2y^2 + 64y^4)]Now, the problem also asks for the sum of all integer coefficients in the complete factorization. Let's identify the coefficients in each factor:- In the first factor, (3x^2 - 8y^2), the coefficients are 3 and -8.- In the second factor, (9x^4 + 24x^2y^2 + 64y^4), the coefficients are 9, 24, and 64.Adding them all up:[3 + (-8) + 9 + 24 + 64]Calculating step by step:- (3 + (-8) = -5)- (-5 + 9 = 4)- (4 + 24 = 28)- (28 + 64 = 92)So, the sum of all integer coefficients is 92.I think that's it. I don't see any further factorization possible for the second factor because it doesn't seem to fit any other special product formulas, like the difference of squares or another difference of cubes. So, this should be the complete factorization, and the sum of the coefficients is 92.**Final Answer**The sum of all integer coefficients in the complete factorization is boxed{92}."},{"question":"If Beth is 18 years old and her little sister is 5, and their younger brother Tom is just 2 years old, in how many years would Beth be twice as old as her sister, three times as old as Tom, and have a combined age of 50 years with her sister and brother?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many years into the future, denoted as ( x ), the given conditions will be satisfied.In ( x ) years:- Beth will be ( 18 + x ) years old.- Her sister will be ( 5 + x ) years old.- Tom will be ( 2 + x ) years old.The first condition is that Beth will be twice as old as her sister:[18 + x = 2 times (5 + x)]Solving this equation:[18 + x = 10 + 2x][x = 8]Next, the second condition is that Beth will be three times as old as Tom:[18 + x = 3 times (2 + x)]Solving this equation:[18 + x = 6 + 3x][2x = 12][x = 6]The third condition is that the combined age of Beth, her sister, and Tom will be 50 years:[(18 + x) + (5 + x) + (2 + x) = 50]Simplifying:[25 + 3x = 50][3x = 25][x = frac{25}{3} approx 8.33]Since ( x ) must be a whole number, there is no integer solution that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously.

Hmm, let me start by recalling the formula for the sum of squares. I think it's ( frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} ). Yeah, that sounds right.So, the sum is ( frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} ), and I want this to be divisible by 500. That means ( frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} ) should be a multiple of 500. To make this easier, maybe I can rewrite the condition as ( k(k+1)(2k+1) ) being a multiple of ( 6 times 500 = 3000 ). So, ( k(k+1)(2k+1) ) needs to be divisible by 3000.Breaking down 3000 into its prime factors: ( 3000 = 2^3 times 3 times 5^3 ). So, I need ( k(k+1)(2k+1) ) to have at least three factors of 2, one factor of 3, and three factors of 5.Let me analyze each prime factor separately.Starting with the factor of 3: Since ( k ), ( k+1 ), and ( 2k+1 ) are three consecutive integers in some sense, at least one of them must be divisible by 3. So, that condition should be satisfied without too much trouble.Now, looking at the factor of 2: ( 2k + 1 ) is always odd because it's one more than an even number. So, ( 2k + 1 ) doesn't contribute any factors of 2. That means the factors of 2 must come from either ( k ) or ( k + 1 ). Since ( k ) and ( k + 1 ) are consecutive integers, one of them is even, and the other is odd. So, to get three factors of 2, the even one needs to be divisible by ( 8 ) (since ( 2^3 = 8 )). Therefore, either ( k ) or ( k + 1 ) must be divisible by 8.Moving on to the factor of 5: We need three factors of 5, so ( 5^3 = 125 ). Again, looking at ( k ), ( k + 1 ), and ( 2k + 1 ), only one of these can be divisible by 125 because they are consecutive in a way. So, we need to ensure that one of these terms is divisible by 125.So, summarizing the conditions:1. Either ( k equiv 0 mod 8 ) or ( k + 1 equiv 0 mod 8 ).2. Either ( k equiv 0 mod 3 ), ( k + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 ), or ( 2k + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 ).3. Either ( k equiv 0 mod 125 ), ( k + 1 equiv 0 mod 125 ), or ( 2k + 1 equiv 0 mod 125 ).Since we're looking for the smallest ( k ), I should probably check these conditions step by step.First, let's handle the modulo 8 condition. So, ( k ) must be congruent to 0 or 7 modulo 8 because if ( k + 1 equiv 0 mod 8 ), then ( k equiv 7 mod 8 ).Next, the modulo 3 condition. Let's see:- If ( k equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( k ) is divisible by 3.- If ( k equiv 2 mod 3 ), then ( 2k + 1 equiv 2*2 + 1 = 5 equiv 2 mod 3 ), which isn't 0. Wait, that doesn't help. Maybe I need to solve ( 2k + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 ). So, ( 2k equiv -1 mod 3 ), which is ( 2k equiv 2 mod 3 ), so ( k equiv 1 mod 3 ).Wait, so if ( k equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( 2k + 1 equiv 0 mod 3 ). So, the possible cases are ( k equiv 0 mod 3 ) or ( k equiv 1 mod 3 ). Hmm, that's different from what I initially thought.So, correcting myself, the modulo 3 condition gives ( k equiv 0 ) or ( 1 mod 3 ).Now, moving on to the modulo 125 condition. We need one of ( k ), ( k + 1 ), or ( 2k + 1 ) to be divisible by 125.Let's consider each case:1. ( k equiv 0 mod 125 )2. ( k + 1 equiv 0 mod 125 ) which implies ( k equiv 124 mod 125 )3. ( 2k + 1 equiv 0 mod 125 ) which implies ( 2k equiv -1 mod 125 ), so ( k equiv (-1)/2 mod 125 ). Since 2 and 125 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod 125 is 63 because ( 2*63 = 126 equiv 1 mod 125 ). So, ( k equiv -1 * 63 mod 125 ) which is ( k equiv -63 mod 125 ) or ( k equiv 62 mod 125 ).So, the possible cases for modulo 125 are ( k equiv 0, 62, 124 mod 125 ).Now, I need to find the smallest ( k ) that satisfies all these conditions simultaneously. This seems like a problem that can be tackled using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). But since there are multiple cases, I might have to check each combination.Let me list all possible combinations:For modulo 8: ( k equiv 0 ) or ( 7 mod 8 )For modulo 3: ( k equiv 0 ) or ( 1 mod 3 )For modulo 125: ( k equiv 0, 62, 124 mod 125 )So, in total, there are 2 (from 8) * 2 (from 3) * 3 (from 125) = 12 possible combinations. I need to find the smallest ( k ) that satisfies one of these combinations.This might take a while, but let me try to approach it systematically.First, let's consider the case where ( k equiv 0 mod 8 ), ( k equiv 0 mod 3 ), and ( k equiv 0 mod 125 ). Then, ( k ) would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 3, and 125. The LCM of 8 and 3 is 24, and LCM of 24 and 125 is 3000. So, ( k = 3000 ) is a solution.But maybe there's a smaller ( k ) that satisfies other combinations. Let's check.Next, consider ( k equiv 0 mod 8 ), ( k equiv 0 mod 3 ), and ( k equiv 62 mod 125 ). So, we need to solve:( k equiv 0 mod 24 ) (since 8 and 3 are coprime, LCM is 24)and( k equiv 62 mod 125 )Using CRT, let me find ( k ) such that:( k = 24m )and( 24m equiv 62 mod 125 )So, ( 24m equiv 62 mod 125 )Let me solve for ( m ):First, find the inverse of 24 mod 125. Let's compute it.We need to find ( x ) such that ( 24x equiv 1 mod 125 ).Using the extended Euclidean algorithm:125 = 5*24 + 524 = 4*5 + 45 = 1*4 + 14 = 4*1 + 0So, backtracking:1 = 5 - 1*4But 4 = 24 - 4*5, so:1 = 5 - 1*(24 - 4*5) = 5 - 24 + 4*5 = 5*5 - 24But 5 = 125 - 5*24, so:1 = 5*(125 - 5*24) - 24 = 5*125 - 25*24 - 24 = 5*125 - 26*24So, ( -26*24 equiv 1 mod 125 ), which means the inverse of 24 mod 125 is -26, which is equivalent to 99 mod 125 (since 125 - 26 = 99).So, ( m equiv 62 * 99 mod 125 )Compute 62*99:62*100 = 6200Subtract 62: 6200 - 62 = 6138Now, 6138 mod 125:125*49 = 61256138 - 6125 = 13So, ( m equiv 13 mod 125 )Thus, ( m = 125n + 13 )Therefore, ( k = 24m = 24*(125n + 13) = 3000n + 312 )So, the smallest positive ( k ) in this case is 312. Hmm, that's smaller than 3000. Let me check if 312 satisfies all conditions.Check modulo 8: 312 / 8 = 39, so 312 ≡ 0 mod 8. Good.Modulo 3: 312 / 3 = 104, so 312 ≡ 0 mod 3. Good.Modulo 125: 312 - 125*2 = 312 - 250 = 62, so 312 ≡ 62 mod 125. Good.So, 312 is a valid solution. Let's see if it's the smallest.Wait, let me check another combination. Maybe ( k equiv 0 mod 8 ), ( k equiv 0 mod 3 ), and ( k equiv 124 mod 125 ).So, ( k equiv 0 mod 24 ) and ( k equiv 124 mod 125 ).Using CRT again:( k = 24m )( 24m equiv 124 mod 125 )So, ( 24m ≡ 124 mod 125 )We already know the inverse of 24 mod 125 is 99, so:( m ≡ 124 * 99 mod 125 )Compute 124*99:124*100 = 12400Subtract 124: 12400 - 124 = 1227612276 mod 125:125*98 = 1225012276 - 12250 = 26So, ( m ≡ 26 mod 125 )Thus, ( m = 125n + 26 )Therefore, ( k = 24*(125n + 26) = 3000n + 624 )So, the smallest positive ( k ) here is 624. That's larger than 312, so 312 is still the smallest so far.Let me check another combination. Maybe ( k equiv 0 mod 8 ), ( k equiv 1 mod 3 ), and ( k equiv 0 mod 125 ).So, ( k ≡ 0 mod 8 ), ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ), ( k ≡ 0 mod 125 ).So, combining ( k ≡ 0 mod 8 ) and ( k ≡ 0 mod 125 ), we get ( k ≡ 0 mod 1000 ) (since LCM of 8 and 125 is 1000). Then, ( k ≡ 0 mod 1000 ) and ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ).So, ( k = 1000m ), and ( 1000m ≡ 1 mod 3 ). Since 1000 ≡ 1 mod 3, so ( m ≡ 1 mod 3 ). Thus, ( m = 3n + 1 ), so ( k = 1000*(3n + 1) = 3000n + 1000 ). The smallest positive ( k ) here is 1000. That's larger than 312, so 312 is still better.Next, ( k ≡ 0 mod 8 ), ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ), ( k ≡ 62 mod 125 ).So, ( k ≡ 0 mod 8 ), ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ), ( k ≡ 62 mod 125 ).First, combine ( k ≡ 0 mod 8 ) and ( k ≡ 1 mod 3 ). Let's solve these two.Let ( k = 8m ). Then, ( 8m ≡ 1 mod 3 ). Since 8 ≡ 2 mod 3, so 2m ≡ 1 mod 3. Multiply both sides by 2 inverse mod 3, which is 2, since 2*2=4≡1 mod3. So, m ≡ 2*1=2 mod3. Thus, m=3n+2. So, k=8*(3n+2)=24n+16.So, ( k ≡ 16 mod24 ).Now, combine with ( k ≡62 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +16 ), and (24n +16 ≡62 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡62 -16=46 mod125).So, (24n ≡46 mod125).Again, using the inverse of 24 mod125, which is 99.So, n≡46*99 mod125.Compute 46*99:46*100=46004600 -46=45544554 mod125:125*36=45004554 -4500=54So, n≡54 mod125.Thus, n=125m +54.Therefore, k=24*(125m +54)+16=3000m +1296 +16=3000m +1312.So, the smallest positive k here is 1312, which is larger than 312.Next combination: ( k ≡0 mod8 ), ( k ≡1 mod3 ), ( k ≡124 mod125 ).So, similar to above, first solve ( k ≡0 mod8 ) and ( k ≡1 mod3 ), which gives ( k ≡16 mod24 ).Then, combine with ( k ≡124 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +16 ), and (24n +16 ≡124 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡124 -16=108 mod125).So, (24n ≡108 mod125).Multiply both sides by inverse of 24 mod125, which is 99.n≡108*99 mod125.Compute 108*99:100*99=99008*99=792Total=9900+792=1069210692 mod125:125*85=1062510692 -10625=67So, n≡67 mod125.Thus, n=125m +67.Therefore, k=24*(125m +67)+16=3000m +1608 +16=3000m +1624.So, the smallest positive k here is 1624, which is larger than 312.Now, let's consider the case where ( k ≡7 mod8 ).So, ( k ≡7 mod8 ).Let me check combinations with ( k ≡0 mod3 ) and ( k ≡0 mod125 ).So, ( k ≡7 mod8 ), ( k ≡0 mod3 ), ( k ≡0 mod125 ).First, combine ( k ≡7 mod8 ) and ( k ≡0 mod3 ).Let ( k=8m +7 ). Then, (8m +7 ≡0 mod3). 8≡2 mod3, so 2m +1 ≡0 mod3. Thus, 2m ≡-1≡2 mod3. So, m≡1 mod3. Thus, m=3n +1. So, k=8*(3n +1)+7=24n +8 +7=24n +15.So, ( k ≡15 mod24 ).Now, combine with ( k ≡0 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +15 ), and (24n +15 ≡0 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡-15 mod125). Since -15 mod125 is 110, so (24n ≡110 mod125).Multiply both sides by inverse of 24 mod125, which is 99.n≡110*99 mod125.Compute 110*99:100*99=990010*99=990Total=9900+990=1089010890 mod125:125*87=1087510890 -10875=15So, n≡15 mod125.Thus, n=125m +15.Therefore, k=24*(125m +15)+15=3000m +360 +15=3000m +375.So, the smallest positive k here is 375. Hmm, that's smaller than 312? Wait, 375 is larger than 312. So, 312 is still smaller.Wait, 375 is larger than 312, so 312 is still the smallest so far.Next, ( k ≡7 mod8 ), ( k ≡0 mod3 ), ( k ≡62 mod125 ).So, first, combine ( k ≡7 mod8 ) and ( k ≡0 mod3 ), which gives ( k ≡15 mod24 ).Then, combine with ( k ≡62 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +15 ), and (24n +15 ≡62 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡62 -15=47 mod125).So, (24n ≡47 mod125).Multiply both sides by inverse of 24 mod125, which is 99.n≡47*99 mod125.Compute 47*99:40*99=39607*99=693Total=3960+693=46534653 mod125:125*37=46254653 -4625=28So, n≡28 mod125.Thus, n=125m +28.Therefore, k=24*(125m +28)+15=3000m +672 +15=3000m +687.So, the smallest positive k here is 687, which is larger than 312.Next, ( k ≡7 mod8 ), ( k ≡0 mod3 ), ( k ≡124 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +15 ), and (24n +15 ≡124 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡124 -15=109 mod125).So, (24n ≡109 mod125).Multiply both sides by 99:n≡109*99 mod125.Compute 109*99:100*99=99009*99=891Total=9900+891=1079110791 mod125:125*86=1075010791 -10750=41So, n≡41 mod125.Thus, n=125m +41.Therefore, k=24*(125m +41)+15=3000m +984 +15=3000m +999.So, the smallest positive k here is 999, which is larger than 312.Now, let's consider ( k ≡7 mod8 ), ( k ≡1 mod3 ), and ( k ≡0 mod125 ).So, combine ( k ≡7 mod8 ) and ( k ≡1 mod3 ).Let ( k=8m +7 ). Then, (8m +7 ≡1 mod3). 8≡2 mod3, so 2m +1 ≡1 mod3. Thus, 2m ≡0 mod3. So, m≡0 mod3. Thus, m=3n. So, k=8*(3n)+7=24n +7.So, ( k ≡7 mod24 ).Now, combine with ( k ≡0 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +7 ), and (24n +7 ≡0 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡-7 mod125). Since -7 mod125 is 118, so (24n ≡118 mod125).Multiply both sides by inverse of 24 mod125, which is 99.n≡118*99 mod125.Compute 118*99:100*99=990018*99=1782Total=9900+1782=1168211682 mod125:125*93=1162511682 -11625=57So, n≡57 mod125.Thus, n=125m +57.Therefore, k=24*(125m +57)+7=3000m +1368 +7=3000m +1375.So, the smallest positive k here is 1375, which is larger than 312.Next, ( k ≡7 mod8 ), ( k ≡1 mod3 ), ( k ≡62 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +7 ), and (24n +7 ≡62 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡62 -7=55 mod125).So, (24n ≡55 mod125).Multiply both sides by 99:n≡55*99 mod125.Compute 55*99:50*99=49505*99=495Total=4950+495=54455445 mod125:125*43=53755445 -5375=70So, n≡70 mod125.Thus, n=125m +70.Therefore, k=24*(125m +70)+7=3000m +1680 +7=3000m +1687.So, the smallest positive k here is 1687, which is larger than 312.Finally, ( k ≡7 mod8 ), ( k ≡1 mod3 ), ( k ≡124 mod125 ).So, ( k=24n +7 ), and (24n +7 ≡124 mod125).Thus, (24n ≡124 -7=117 mod125).So, (24n ≡117 mod125).Multiply both sides by 99:n≡117*99 mod125.Compute 117*99:100*99=990017*99=1683Total=9900+1683=1158311583 mod125:125*92=1150011583 -11500=83So, n≡83 mod125.Thus, n=125m +83.Therefore, k=24*(125m +83)+7=3000m +1992 +7=3000m +1999.So, the smallest positive k here is 1999, which is larger than 312.So, after checking all 12 combinations, the smallest k I found is 312. Let me verify if 312 indeed satisfies all the conditions.First, compute the sum ( S = frac{312*313*625}{6} ).Wait, 2k +1 when k=312 is 625, which is 5^4, so that's good for the 5^3 factor.Compute S:First, compute numerator: 312*313*625.But instead of computing the whole thing, let's factor it:312 = 8*39 = 8*3*13313 is prime.625 = 5^4So, numerator factors: 2^3 * 3 * 13 * 313 * 5^4Denominator: 6 = 2*3So, S = (2^3 * 3 * 13 * 313 * 5^4) / (2*3) = 2^2 * 13 * 313 * 5^4So, S = 4 * 13 * 313 * 625Now, 625 is 5^4, which is divisible by 5^3, so S is divisible by 5^3.Also, 4 is 2^2, but we needed 2^3. Wait, but in the numerator, we had 2^3, and we divided by 2, so we have 2^2 left. Hmm, that's only 4, which is 2^2, but we need 2^3 for 500. Wait, 500 is 2^2 * 5^3, so actually, S is divisible by 2^2 * 5^3, which is 500. So, S is indeed a multiple of 500.Wait, but earlier, I thought we needed 2^3, but actually, 500 is 2^2 * 5^3. So, S only needs to have 2^2 and 5^3. So, in this case, S has 2^2 and 5^4, so it's sufficient.Therefore, 312 is indeed a valid solution.But wait, earlier I thought 3000 was the solution, but 312 is smaller. So, why did I initially think 3000? Maybe because I didn't consider all combinations. So, 312 is the correct smallest k.Wait, but let me check if there's a smaller k than 312. Maybe I missed some combination.Wait, in the combinations above, the smallest k I found was 312. Let me see if there's a smaller k that I might have missed.Wait, another approach: Since 500 = 4 * 125, and 4 and 125 are coprime, I can separately ensure that the sum is divisible by 4 and by 125, and then use CRT.So, let me try this approach.First, ensure that the sum is divisible by 4.The sum is ( frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} ).For this to be divisible by 4, the numerator must be divisible by 24 (since 6*4=24).So, ( k(k+1)(2k+1) ) must be divisible by 24.We already considered this earlier, but let's see:Since 2k +1 is odd, the factors of 2 must come from k and k+1. Since they are consecutive, one is even, and the other is odd. So, the even one must be divisible by 8 to get 2^3, but wait, 24 is 2^3 *3, so we need 2^3 and 3.Wait, but in the sum, we have ( frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} ), so for this to be divisible by 4, the numerator must be divisible by 24.So, ( k(k+1)(2k+1) ) must be divisible by 24.We can analyze this:- Since k and k+1 are consecutive, one is even, so divisible by 2.- Among three consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 3, but here, we have k, k+1, 2k+1. It's not exactly three consecutive, but similar.Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of modulo 4 and modulo 3.Wait, maybe this approach is complicating things. Since I already found that 312 works, and it's smaller than 3000, perhaps 312 is the correct answer.Wait, but let me check if 312 is indeed the smallest. Maybe there's a smaller k.Wait, let me try k=124. Let's see if the sum is divisible by 500.Compute S = 124*125*249 /6.First, compute numerator: 124*125*249.124=4*31125=5^3249=3*83So, numerator=4*31*5^3*3*83Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (4*31*5^3*3*83)/(2*3)= (2^2 *31 *5^3 *3 *83)/(2*3)= 2*31*5^3*83So, S=2*31*125*83Which is 2*31*83*125. This is clearly divisible by 125, but is it divisible by 4? Since S=2*31*83*125, which is 2*(odd)*(odd)*125. So, it's only divisible by 2, not by 4. Therefore, S is not divisible by 4, hence not by 500.So, k=124 doesn't work.Similarly, let's check k=62.Compute S=62*63*125 /6.62=2*3163=7*9=7*3^2125=5^3So, numerator=2*31*7*3^2*5^3Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (2*31*7*3^2*5^3)/(2*3)=31*7*3*5^3Which is 31*7*3*125. This is divisible by 125, but only has one factor of 2 in the numerator, which cancels with the denominator, so S is not divisible by 4. Hence, not divisible by 500.Similarly, k=24:S=24*25*49 /6= (24/6)*25*49=4*25*49=4*1225=4900.4900 is 49*100=49*4*25=4*25*49. So, 4900 is divisible by 4 and 25, hence by 100, but not by 500. So, 4900 is not divisible by 500.Similarly, k=25:S=25*26*51 /6= (25)*(26/2)*(51/3)=25*13*17=25*221=5525.5525 divided by 500 is 11.05, so not an integer. So, not divisible by 500.k=31:S=31*32*63 /6=31*(32/2)*(63/3)=31*16*21=31*336=10416.10416 divided by 500 is 20.832, not integer.k=62: already checked, not divisible by 500.k=75:S=75*76*151 /6=75*(76/2)*(151/3)=75*38*(151/3). Wait, 151 is not divisible by 3, so this approach is messy. Alternatively, compute S=75*76*151 /6.75=25*376=4*19151 is prime.So, numerator=25*3*4*19*151Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (25*3*4*19*151)/(2*3)=25*2*19*151=25*38*151.25*38=950, 950*151=143,450.143,450 divided by 500 is 286.9, which is not an integer. So, not divisible by 500.k=100:S=100*101*201 /6=100*(101)*(201)/6.100=4*25201=3*67So, numerator=4*25*101*3*67Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (4*25*101*3*67)/(2*3)=2*25*101*67=2*25=50, 50*101=5050, 5050*67=339,850.339,850 divided by 500 is 679.7, not integer.k=124: already checked, not divisible by 500.k=125:S=125*126*251 /6.125=5^3126=2*3^2*7251 is prime.So, numerator=5^3*2*3^2*7*251Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (5^3*2*3^2*7*251)/(2*3)=5^3*3*7*251=125*3*7*251.Compute 125*3=375, 375*7=2625, 2625*251=658,125.658,125 divided by 500 is 1316.25, not integer.k=150:S=150*151*301 /6.150=2*3*5^2301=7*43So, numerator=2*3*5^2*151*7*43Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (2*3*5^2*151*7*43)/(2*3)=5^2*151*7*43=25*151*7*43.25*151=3775, 3775*7=26,425, 26,425*43=1,132,275.1,132,275 divided by 500 is 2264.55, not integer.k=187:Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since I found that k=312 works, and it's the smallest in the combinations I checked, perhaps 312 is indeed the smallest.Wait, but earlier, I thought 3000 was the answer, but that was without considering all combinations. So, 312 is smaller and works.Wait, but let me check k=156.Compute S=156*157*313 /6.156=12*13=4*3*13157 is prime313 is primeSo, numerator=4*3*13*157*313Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (4*3*13*157*313)/(2*3)=2*13*157*313.2*13=26, 26*157=4082, 4082*313=1,280,  4082*300=1,224,600, 4082*13=53,066, total=1,224,600+53,066=1,277,666.1,277,666 divided by 500 is 2555.332, not integer.So, k=156 doesn't work.Similarly, k=208:S=208*209*417 /6.208=16*13209=11*19417=3*139So, numerator=16*13*11*19*3*139Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (16*13*11*19*3*139)/(2*3)=8*13*11*19*139.8*13=104, 104*11=1144, 1144*19=21,736, 21,736*139=3,025,  21,736*100=2,173,600, 21,736*39=847,704, total=2,173,600+847,704=3,021,304.3,021,304 divided by 500 is 6,042.608, not integer.So, k=208 doesn't work.k=240:S=240*241*481 /6.240=16*15=16*3*5481=13*37So, numerator=16*3*5*241*13*37Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (16*3*5*241*13*37)/(2*3)=8*5*241*13*37.8*5=40, 40*241=9,640, 9,640*13=125,320, 125,320*37=4,636,  125,320*30=3,759,600, 125,320*7=877,240, total=3,759,600+877,240=4,636,840.4,636,840 divided by 500 is 9,273.68, not integer.So, k=240 doesn't work.k=256:S=256*257*513 /6.256=2^8513=3^3*19So, numerator=2^8*257*3^3*19Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (2^8*257*3^3*19)/(2*3)=2^7*257*3^2*19.2^7=128, 128*257=32,  128*200=25,600, 128*57=7,296, total=25,600+7,296=32,896.32,896*9=296,064, 296,064*19=5,625,  296,064*10=2,960,640, 296,064*9=2,664,576, total=2,960,640+2,664,576=5,625,216.5,625,216 divided by 500 is 11,250.432, not integer.So, k=256 doesn't work.k=300:S=300*301*601 /6.300=2^2*3*5^2601 is primeSo, numerator=2^2*3*5^2*301*601Denominator=6=2*3So, S= (2^2*3*5^2*301*601)/(2*3)=2*5^2*301*601.2*25=50, 50*301=15,050, 15,050*601=9,045,  15,050*600=9,030,000, 15,050*1=15,050, total=9,030,000+15,050=9,045,050.9,045,050 divided by 500 is 18,090.1, not integer.So, k=300 doesn't work.k=312:As before, S=312*313*625 /6= (312/6)*313*625=52*313*625.Compute 52*313=16,276, then 16,276*625.Compute 16,276*600=9,765,600, 16,276*25=406,900, total=9,765,600+406,900=10,172,500.10,172,500 divided by 500 is 20,345, which is an integer. So, yes, k=312 works.Therefore, after checking, k=312 is indeed the smallest positive integer such that the sum is a multiple of 500."},{"question":"In a (100 times 100) square, 10,000 cuts were made along the grid lines (each cut being the length of one cell), and the square broke into 2,500 four-cell figures. How many of them are (2 times 2) squares?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 100x100 square that's been cut into 2,500 four-cell figures using 10,000 cuts. The question is asking how many of these four-cell figures are 2x2 squares. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what exactly is happening here. We have a big square, 100 units by 100 units, right? And it's been divided into smaller figures, each made up of four cells. Each cut is along a grid line and is the length of one cell. So, each cut is essentially removing a line between two cells, right? And with 10,000 cuts, the square is broken down into 2,500 four-cell figures. That makes sense because 100x100 is 10,000 cells, and if each figure is four cells, then 10,000 divided by 4 is 2,500. So, that checks out.Now, the question is about how many of these four-cell figures are 2x2 squares. So, I need to figure out how many of these 2,500 figures are perfect 2x2 squares, and how many are other shapes, like maybe 1x4 rectangles or some other four-cell shapes.I think the key here might be to look at the perimeters of these figures. Because a 2x2 square has a certain perimeter, and other four-cell figures have different perimeters. Maybe I can use the total number of cuts to figure out the total perimeter and then see how many of each shape there are.Let me think about this. Each cut along a grid line is essentially removing a line segment, which affects the perimeter. If I make a cut, it's like adding two edges to the perimeter—one on each side of the cut. So, each cut increases the total perimeter by 2 units. Since there are 10,000 cuts, that would add 20,000 units to the perimeter.But wait, the original square also has a perimeter. The original 100x100 square has a perimeter of 400 units—because each side is 100 units, and there are four sides. So, the total perimeter after all the cuts would be the original perimeter plus twice the number of cuts. That is, 400 + 2*10,000 = 400 + 20,000 = 20,400 units.Okay, so the total perimeter of all the four-cell figures combined is 20,400 units. Now, each four-cell figure contributes to this total perimeter. So, if I can figure out the perimeter contributed by each type of four-cell figure, I can set up an equation to solve for the number of 2x2 squares.Let's consider the perimeters of different four-cell figures. A 2x2 square has a perimeter of 8 units. Because each side is 2 units, and there are four sides, so 2*4 = 8. On the other hand, other four-cell figures, like a 1x4 rectangle, have a different perimeter. A 1x4 rectangle has a perimeter of 10 units—because it's 1 unit wide and 4 units long, so 2*(1+4) = 10. Similarly, other shapes like T-shapes, L-shapes, or S-shapes also have perimeters of 10 units or more.Wait, so if all the four-cell figures were 2x2 squares, the total perimeter would be 2,500 * 8 = 20,000 units. But we know that the total perimeter is actually 20,400 units, which is 400 units more. So, the extra perimeter must be coming from the other four-cell figures that aren't 2x2 squares.Each non-2x2 square four-cell figure contributes an extra 2 units of perimeter compared to a 2x2 square. Because 10 - 8 = 2. So, if I let x be the number of 2x2 squares, then the number of non-2x2 squares is 2,500 - x. Each of these contributes an extra 2 units, so the total extra perimeter is 2*(2,500 - x).We know that the total perimeter is 20,400, which is 400 units more than 20,000. So, 2*(2,500 - x) = 400. Let me write that down:2*(2,500 - x) = 400Dividing both sides by 2:2,500 - x = 200Then, solving for x:x = 2,500 - 200 = 2,300So, there are 2,300 2x2 squares.Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 2,300 2x2 squares, then the number of non-2x2 squares is 200. Each non-2x2 square adds 2 extra units to the perimeter, so 200 * 2 = 400 extra units. Adding that to the 20,000 from the 2x2 squares gives 20,400, which matches the total perimeter. So, that seems to check out.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. The total number of four-cell figures is 2,500. Each 2x2 square has a perimeter of 8, and each other four-cell figure has a perimeter of 10. The total perimeter is 20,400.So, total perimeter = 8x + 10(2,500 - x) = 20,400Expanding that:8x + 25,000 - 10x = 20,400Combining like terms:-2x + 25,000 = 20,400Subtracting 25,000 from both sides:-2x = -4,600Dividing both sides by -2:x = 2,300Yep, that's the same result. So, I think that's correct.Another way to think about it is that each non-2x2 square adds an extra 2 units to the perimeter. Since the total extra perimeter is 400 units, there must be 200 non-2x2 squares. Therefore, the number of 2x2 squares is 2,500 - 200 = 2,300.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 2,300 2x2 squares."},{"question":"A line through the centroid G of the triangle ABC intersects the side AB at P and the side AC at Q Show that  frac{PB}{PA} cdot frac{QC}{QA} leq frac{1}{4} .Sorry for Triple-Posting. If possible, please merge the solutions to one document. I think there was an error because it may have automatically triple-posted.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here: A line through the centroid G of triangle ABC intersects side AB at P and side AC at Q. I need to show that the product (PB/PA) * (QC/QA) is less than or equal to 1/4. Hmm, okay, let's see how I can approach this.First, I remember that the centroid of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. So, if I draw a line through the centroid G, it should intersect AB and AC at some points P and Q, respectively. I need to find the ratios PB/PA and QC/QA and then multiply them together.Maybe I can use coordinate geometry for this. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let's place point A at (0,0), point B at (b,0), and point C at (c,d). Then, the centroid G would be at the average of the coordinates of A, B, and C. So, G would be at ((0 + b + c)/3, (0 + 0 + d)/3) = ((b + c)/3, d/3).Now, let's consider the line passing through G and intersecting AB at P and AC at Q. Let me denote the coordinates of P as (p,0) since it's on AB, and Q as (q, r) since it's on AC. Wait, but AC goes from (0,0) to (c,d), so any point on AC can be parameterized. Maybe it's better to parameterize the line PQ.Let me think. Since the line passes through G, I can write its equation in parametric form. Let me denote the direction vector of the line as (h,k). Then, any point on the line can be written as G + t*(h,k) where t is a parameter.So, the parametric equations would be:x = (b + c)/3 + t*hy = d/3 + t*kNow, this line intersects AB at P and AC at Q. Let's find the values of t where this happens.First, intersection with AB: AB is the x-axis, so y=0. So, set y = 0:d/3 + t*k = 0=> t = -d/(3k)Then, the x-coordinate at P is:x = (b + c)/3 + (-d/(3k))*hSo, P is at ((b + c)/3 - (d*h)/(3k), 0)Similarly, intersection with AC: AC is the line from (0,0) to (c,d), so its parametric equations can be written as x = c*s, y = d*s for some parameter s between 0 and 1.So, setting the parametric equations equal:c*s = (b + c)/3 + t*hd*s = d/3 + t*kFrom the second equation:d*s = d/3 + t*kDivide both sides by d (assuming d ≠ 0):s = 1/3 + t*(k/d)From the first equation:c*s = (b + c)/3 + t*hSubstitute s from above:c*(1/3 + t*(k/d)) = (b + c)/3 + t*hMultiply through:c/3 + c*t*(k/d) = (b + c)/3 + t*hSubtract c/3 from both sides:c*t*(k/d) = b/3 + t*hBring all terms to one side:c*t*(k/d) - t*h = b/3Factor out t:t*(c*(k/d) - h) = b/3So,t = (b/3) / (c*(k/d) - h)Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, I remember that in mass point geometry, the centroid divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. Maybe I can use that here.Let me consider the ratios PB/PA and QC/QA. Let me denote PA = x and PB = y, so that AB = x + y. Similarly, let QA = m and QC = n, so that AC = m + n.Since G is the centroid, the line PQ passes through G. I think there's a theorem related to this, maybe Ceva's Theorem or something similar.Wait, Ceva's Theorem states that for concurrent lines from the vertices, the product of the ratios is 1. But in this case, the line is passing through the centroid, which is the intersection of the medians. So, maybe Ceva's Theorem can be applied here.But Ceva's Theorem is about concurrent lines from all three vertices, but here we have a line cutting two sides. Maybe I need to use Menelaus's Theorem instead.Menelaus's Theorem applies to a transversal cutting through the sides of a triangle. It states that (AF/FB) * (BD/DC) * (CE/EA) = 1 for a transversal cutting through the sides of triangle ABC.In our case, the transversal is PQ cutting through AB at P and AC at Q, and passing through G. So, maybe I can apply Menelaus's Theorem here.But Menelaus's Theorem requires the transversal to cut all three sides (or their extensions). Here, PQ cuts AB and AC, but not BC. So, maybe I need to extend PQ to meet BC at some point R, and then apply Menelaus's Theorem.Let me try that. Let me extend PQ to meet BC at R. Then, by Menelaus's Theorem, (PB/PA) * (AQ/QC) * (CR/RB) = 1.Wait, but I don't know where R is. Maybe I can express CR/RB in terms of other ratios.Alternatively, since G is the centroid, it divides the median in a 2:1 ratio. So, if I can relate R to G, maybe I can find some relations.Wait, maybe instead of Menelaus, I can use coordinate geometry again but in a more straightforward way.Let me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (1,0), and C at (0,1). Then, the centroid G is at ((0 + 1 + 0)/3, (0 + 0 + 1)/3) = (1/3, 1/3).Now, let me consider a line passing through G with some slope m. The equation of this line is y - 1/3 = m(x - 1/3).This line intersects AB at P and AC at Q.First, find P on AB. AB is the x-axis, so y=0. Substitute y=0 into the line equation:0 - 1/3 = m(x - 1/3)=> -1/3 = m*x - m/3=> m*x = -1/3 + m/3=> x = (-1/3 + m/3)/m = (-1 + m)/(3m)So, P is at ((-1 + m)/(3m), 0).Similarly, find Q on AC. AC is the line x=0, so set x=0 in the line equation:y - 1/3 = m(0 - 1/3)=> y = 1/3 - m/3So, Q is at (0, (1 - m)/3).Now, let's compute the ratios PB/PA and QC/QA.First, PA is the distance from A to P. Since A is at (0,0) and P is at ((-1 + m)/(3m), 0), PA = |(-1 + m)/(3m) - 0| = |(-1 + m)/(3m)|.Similarly, PB is the distance from P to B. B is at (1,0), so PB = |1 - (-1 + m)/(3m)| = |1 + (1 - m)/(3m)| = |(3m + 1 - m)/(3m)| = |(2m + 1)/(3m)|.So, PB/PA = |(2m + 1)/(3m)| / |(-1 + m)/(3m)| = |(2m + 1)/( -1 + m)|.Similarly, QA is the distance from A to Q. A is at (0,0) and Q is at (0, (1 - m)/3), so QA = |(1 - m)/3 - 0| = |(1 - m)/3|.QC is the distance from Q to C. C is at (0,1), so QC = |1 - (1 - m)/3| = |(3 - 1 + m)/3| = |(2 + m)/3|.So, QC/QA = |(2 + m)/3| / |(1 - m)/3| = |(2 + m)/(1 - m)|.Therefore, the product (PB/PA)*(QC/QA) = |(2m + 1)/( -1 + m)| * |(2 + m)/(1 - m)|.Simplify the expression:First, note that |(2m + 1)/( -1 + m)| = |(2m + 1)/(m - 1)| and |(2 + m)/(1 - m)| = |(m + 2)/(1 - m)|.So, the product becomes |(2m + 1)/(m - 1)| * |(m + 2)/(1 - m)|.Notice that (m - 1) and (1 - m) are negatives of each other, so their product is negative. However, since we're taking absolute values, the negatives will cancel out.So, the product simplifies to |(2m + 1)(m + 2)| / |(m - 1)(1 - m)| = |(2m + 1)(m + 2)| / |(m - 1)^2|.But (m - 1)^2 is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value:= |(2m + 1)(m + 2)| / (m - 1)^2.Now, let's expand the numerator:(2m + 1)(m + 2) = 2m^2 + 4m + m + 2 = 2m^2 + 5m + 2.So, the expression becomes |2m^2 + 5m + 2| / (m - 1)^2.But since we're dealing with ratios of lengths, which are positive, we can consider m such that the expressions inside the absolute values are positive. So, we can drop the absolute value:= (2m^2 + 5m + 2) / (m - 1)^2.Now, we need to show that this expression is less than or equal to 1/4.So, set up the inequality:(2m^2 + 5m + 2) / (m - 1)^2 ≤ 1/4.Multiply both sides by (m - 1)^2 (assuming m ≠ 1, which is true because if m=1, the line would be vertical, but in our coordinate system, the line through G with m=1 would intersect AB at some point, but let's just proceed):2m^2 + 5m + 2 ≤ (1/4)(m - 1)^2.Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:4*(2m^2 + 5m + 2) ≤ (m - 1)^2.Expand both sides:Left side: 8m^2 + 20m + 8.Right side: m^2 - 2m + 1.Bring all terms to the left side:8m^2 + 20m + 8 - m^2 + 2m - 1 ≤ 0.Simplify:7m^2 + 22m + 7 ≤ 0.Now, we have a quadratic inequality: 7m^2 + 22m + 7 ≤ 0.To find where this inequality holds, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation 7m^2 + 22m + 7 = 0.Using the quadratic formula:m = [-22 ± sqrt(22^2 - 4*7*7)] / (2*7)= [-22 ± sqrt(484 - 196)] / 14= [-22 ± sqrt(288)] / 14= [-22 ± 12*sqrt(2)] / 14= [-11 ± 6*sqrt(2)] / 7.So, the roots are m = [-11 + 6√2]/7 and m = [-11 - 6√2]/7.Since the coefficient of m^2 is positive (7), the quadratic opens upwards. Therefore, the inequality 7m^2 + 22m + 7 ≤ 0 holds between the two roots.So, the values of m for which the original inequality (PB/PA)*(QC/QA) ≤ 1/4 holds are between [-11 - 6√2]/7 and [-11 + 6√2]/7.But wait, in our coordinate system, the slope m can be any real number except where the line is vertical or horizontal. However, we need to ensure that points P and Q lie on the sides AB and AC, respectively.Looking back at the coordinates of P and Q:P is at ((-1 + m)/(3m), 0). For P to lie on AB between A and B, the x-coordinate must be between 0 and 1.Similarly, Q is at (0, (1 - m)/3). For Q to lie on AC between A and C, the y-coordinate must be between 0 and 1.So, let's find the constraints on m.For P:0 ≤ (-1 + m)/(3m) ≤ 1.Let's solve the inequalities:First, (-1 + m)/(3m) ≥ 0.Case 1: 3m > 0 => m > 0.Then, (-1 + m) ≥ 0 => m ≥ 1.But if m ≥ 1, then (-1 + m)/(3m) = (m - 1)/(3m). Since m ≥ 1, m - 1 ≥ 0, so this is non-negative.Also, (-1 + m)/(3m) ≤ 1:(m - 1)/(3m) ≤ 1=> m - 1 ≤ 3m=> -1 ≤ 2m=> m ≥ -1/2.But since m > 0, this is automatically satisfied.So, for m > 0, P lies on AB between A and B when m ≥ 1.Wait, but if m = 1, then P is at (0,0), which is point A. If m > 1, P is between A and B.Wait, actually, when m approaches infinity, P approaches (1/3, 0), which is closer to A. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check.Wait, let's plug m = 2:P = ((-1 + 2)/(6), 0) = (1/6, 0), which is between A(0,0) and B(1,0).Similarly, m = 1:P = ((-1 + 1)/3, 0) = (0,0), which is A.So, for m > 1, P is between A and B.For m < 1, let's see:If m is between 0 and 1, say m = 0.5:P = ((-1 + 0.5)/(1.5), 0) = (-0.5/1.5, 0) = (-1/3, 0), which is outside AB.So, for m between 0 and 1, P is outside AB towards the left of A.Similarly, for m negative, say m = -1:P = ((-1 -1)/(-3), 0) = (2/3, 0), which is between A and B.Wait, so for m negative, P is between A and B.So, the condition for P to lie on AB between A and B is m ≥ 1 or m < 0.Similarly, for Q:Q is at (0, (1 - m)/3). For Q to lie on AC between A and C, the y-coordinate must be between 0 and 1.So, 0 ≤ (1 - m)/3 ≤ 1.Multiply all parts by 3:0 ≤ 1 - m ≤ 3.Subtract 1:-1 ≤ -m ≤ 2.Multiply by -1 (reversing inequalities):1 ≥ m ≥ -2.So, m must be between -2 and 1.But from P's condition, m must be ≥1 or m <0.Combining both conditions:For Q to be on AC between A and C, m must be between -2 and 1.For P to be on AB between A and B, m must be ≥1 or m <0.So, the overlapping regions are:-2 ≤ m <0 or m =1.But at m=1, P is at A, which is a vertex, so maybe we exclude m=1.So, m ∈ [-2, 0).Now, recall that our quadratic inequality 7m^2 + 22m + 7 ≤ 0 holds for m between [-11 - 6√2]/7 and [-11 + 6√2]/7.Let's approximate the roots:√2 ≈ 1.4146√2 ≈ 8.485So,[-11 - 8.485]/7 ≈ (-19.485)/7 ≈ -2.783[-11 + 8.485]/7 ≈ (-2.515)/7 ≈ -0.359So, the inequality holds for m between approximately -2.783 and -0.359.But from our earlier analysis, m must be between -2 and 0.So, the overlap is m between -2 and -0.359.Therefore, for m in [-2, -0.359], the inequality (PB/PA)*(QC/QA) ≤ 1/4 holds.But wait, we need to show that for any line through G, the product is ≤1/4. However, from our analysis, it's only ≤1/4 when m is in [-2, -0.359]. What about when m is outside this range?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let's go back.When I set up the coordinate system, I placed A at (0,0), B at (1,0), and C at (0,1). The centroid G is at (1/3,1/3).Then, I considered a line through G with slope m, intersecting AB at P and AC at Q.I found expressions for PB/PA and QC/QA in terms of m, and then set up the inequality.But perhaps instead of using slope m, I should parameterize the line differently to avoid dealing with the slope.Alternatively, maybe I can use barycentric coordinates or area ratios.Wait, another approach: Since G is the centroid, it divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. So, if I consider the line PQ passing through G, maybe I can express the ratios PB/PA and QC/QA in terms of the position of G.Let me denote PA = x, so PB = AB - x. Similarly, QA = y, so QC = AC - y.But I don't know AB and AC lengths, but since we're dealing with ratios, maybe it's okay.Wait, in barycentric coordinates, the centroid has coordinates (1/3,1/3,1/3). So, any line through G can be represented as a linear combination.Alternatively, maybe using vectors.Let me try vectors.Let me denote vectors with origin at A. Let vector AB = **b**, vector AC = **c**.Then, centroid G = (A + B + C)/3 = (0 + **b** + **c**)/3.Let P be a point on AB, so P = t**b** for some t between 0 and 1.Similarly, Q is a point on AC, so Q = s**c** for some s between 0 and 1.The line PQ passes through G, so G can be expressed as a linear combination of P and Q.So, G = (1 - λ)P + λQ for some λ.Substituting P and Q:( **b** + **c** ) / 3 = (1 - λ)t**b** + λ s**c**.Equate coefficients:For **b**: (1 - λ)t = 1/3For **c**: λ s = 1/3So, we have two equations:(1 - λ)t = 1/3 ...(1)λ s = 1/3 ...(2)From equation (2): λ = 1/(3s)Substitute into equation (1):(1 - 1/(3s)) t = 1/3Multiply both sides by 3s:(3s - 1) t = sSo,t = s / (3s - 1)Now, since P is on AB, t must be between 0 and 1. Similarly, Q is on AC, so s must be between 0 and 1.From t = s / (3s - 1), we need t ≥ 0 and t ≤ 1.First, t ≥ 0:s / (3s - 1) ≥ 0This implies that s and (3s - 1) have the same sign.Case 1: Both positive.s > 0 and 3s - 1 > 0 => s > 1/3.Case 2: Both negative.s < 0 and 3s - 1 < 0 => s < 0.But since s is between 0 and 1, Case 2 is invalid because s cannot be negative.So, s > 1/3.Also, t ≤ 1:s / (3s - 1) ≤ 1Multiply both sides by (3s - 1). Since s > 1/3, 3s - 1 > 0, so inequality remains the same:s ≤ 3s - 1=> 0 ≤ 2s - 1=> 2s ≥ 1=> s ≥ 1/2So, s must be between 1/2 and 1.Similarly, t = s / (3s - 1). Let's see what t is when s = 1/2:t = (1/2) / (3*(1/2) - 1) = (1/2) / (3/2 - 1) = (1/2) / (1/2) = 1.When s approaches 1:t = 1 / (3*1 - 1) = 1/2.So, t decreases from 1 to 1/2 as s increases from 1/2 to 1.Now, let's compute the ratios PB/PA and QC/QA.PA = length from A to P = t*AB. Since AB is a vector, but in terms of length, if AB has length |**b**|, then PA = t|**b**|, PB = (1 - t)|**b**|.Similarly, QA = s|**c**|, QC = (1 - s)|**c**|.But since we're dealing with ratios, the actual lengths will cancel out.So,PB/PA = (1 - t)/tQC/QA = (1 - s)/sTherefore, the product is:[(1 - t)/t] * [(1 - s)/s] = [(1 - t)(1 - s)] / (t s)From earlier, we have t = s / (3s - 1). Let's substitute t:= [ (1 - s/(3s - 1)) * (1 - s) ] / [ (s/(3s - 1)) * s ]Simplify numerator:1 - s/(3s - 1) = (3s - 1 - s) / (3s - 1) = (2s - 1)/(3s - 1)So, numerator becomes:(2s - 1)/(3s - 1) * (1 - s) = (2s - 1)(1 - s)/(3s - 1)Denominator:(s/(3s - 1)) * s = s^2 / (3s - 1)So, the entire expression is:[ (2s - 1)(1 - s)/(3s - 1) ] / [ s^2 / (3s - 1) ] = [ (2s - 1)(1 - s) ] / s^2Simplify:= (2s - 1)(1 - s) / s^2Expand numerator:(2s - 1)(1 - s) = 2s(1 - s) - 1(1 - s) = 2s - 2s^2 - 1 + s = 3s - 2s^2 - 1So, the expression becomes:(3s - 2s^2 - 1) / s^2 = ( -2s^2 + 3s - 1 ) / s^2Factor numerator:-2s^2 + 3s - 1 = -(2s^2 - 3s + 1) = -(2s - 1)(s - 1)So,= -(2s - 1)(s - 1) / s^2But since s is between 1/2 and 1, (s - 1) is negative, and (2s - 1) is positive (since s ≥ 1/2). So, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is positive, so the entire expression is positive.Thus,(PB/PA)*(QC/QA) = (2s - 1)(1 - s)/s^2Wait, but earlier I had a negative sign, but since both numerator and denominator are positive, it's positive.So, let's write it as:(2s - 1)(1 - s)/s^2Now, we need to show that this is ≤ 1/4.So, set up the inequality:(2s - 1)(1 - s)/s^2 ≤ 1/4Multiply both sides by s^2 (since s > 0):(2s - 1)(1 - s) ≤ s^2 /4Expand the left side:(2s - 1)(1 - s) = 2s(1 - s) - 1(1 - s) = 2s - 2s^2 - 1 + s = 3s - 2s^2 - 1So,3s - 2s^2 - 1 ≤ s^2 /4Bring all terms to the left:3s - 2s^2 - 1 - s^2/4 ≤ 0Combine like terms:-2s^2 - s^2/4 + 3s - 1 ≤ 0Convert to common denominator:-8s^2/4 - s^2/4 + 12s/4 - 4/4 ≤ 0Combine:(-9s^2 + 12s - 4)/4 ≤ 0Multiply both sides by 4 (positive, so inequality remains):-9s^2 + 12s - 4 ≤ 0Multiply both sides by -1 (reverses inequality):9s^2 - 12s + 4 ≥ 0Now, solve 9s^2 - 12s + 4 ≥ 0Factor the quadratic:9s^2 - 12s + 4 = (3s - 2)^2So, (3s - 2)^2 ≥ 0Which is always true since a square is always non-negative.Thus, the inequality holds for all real s. But in our case, s is between 1/2 and 1.Therefore, (PB/PA)*(QC/QA) ≤ 1/4 holds for all lines through G intersecting AB and AC.Wait, but earlier when I used coordinate geometry, I found that the inequality only holds for m between -2 and -0.359, but with this vector approach, it seems to hold for all s between 1/2 and 1.I think the discrepancy arises because in the coordinate approach, I fixed the coordinate system with specific coordinates, which might have introduced some constraints, whereas the vector approach is more general.Therefore, the correct conclusion is that for any line through the centroid G intersecting AB and AC, the product (PB/PA)*(QC/QA) is always less than or equal to 1/4.So, the final answer is:boxed{dfrac{1}{4}}"},{"question":"In the city of Omsk, a metro line was built in a straight line. On this same line is the house where Nikita and Yegor live. Every morning, they simultaneously leave the house for their lessons, after which Yegor runs to the nearest metro station at a speed of 12 km/h, while Nikita walks along the metro line to another station at a speed of 6 km/h. Despite this, Nikita always manages to reach his lesson on time, whereas Yegor does not, even though he doesn't delay anywhere. Find the maximum possible speed of the metro trains, given that it is constant and an integer. (Assume the school is located directly at a certain metro station, distinct from the given ones).","answer":"Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Nikita and Yegor living in Omsk and their commute to school using the metro. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the setup: They both leave home at the same time. Yegor runs to the nearest metro station at 12 km/h, while Nikita walks to another station at 6 km/h. Despite Nikita walking slower, he always makes it on time, whereas Yegor doesn't. The question is asking for the maximum possible speed of the metro trains, which is constant and an integer.Okay, so let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:- ( v ) is the speed of the metro trains (in km/h).- ( S ) is the distance between two consecutive metro stations.- ( R ) is the distance from their home to the nearest metro station.Since the metro line is straight, and their home is somewhere along this line, the distance from their home to the farther station would be ( S - R ).Now, let's think about the time each person takes to reach their respective stations.For Yegor:He runs to the nearest station at 12 km/h. So, the time he takes to reach the nearest station is ( frac{R}{12} ) hours.For Nikita:He walks to the farther station at 6 km/h. The distance he needs to cover is ( S - R ), so his time is ( frac{S - R}{6} ) hours.Now, the metro trains are moving at speed ( v ). So, once Yegor reaches the nearest station, the metro needs to cover the distance between the two stations to reach Nikita's station. The time it takes for the metro to go from the nearest station to the farther station is ( frac{S}{v} ) hours.But here's the catch: Yegor doesn't make it on time, while Nikita does. That means the time Yegor takes to reach the station plus the time the metro takes to reach Nikita's station is more than the time Nikita takes to walk to his station.So, mathematically, this can be written as:[ frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} ]This inequality represents that Yegor's total time (running to the station plus waiting for the metro) is more than Nikita's walking time.Let me rearrange this inequality to solve for ( v ).First, multiply both sides by 12v to eliminate the denominators:[ Rv + 12S > 2v(S - R) ]Expanding the right side:[ Rv + 12S > 2vS - 2vR ]Bring all terms to one side:[ Rv + 12S - 2vS + 2vR > 0 ]Combine like terms:[ (Rv + 2vR) + 12S - 2vS > 0 ][ 3vR + 12S - 2vS > 0 ]Factor out ( v ) and ( S ):[ v(3R - 2S) + 12S > 0 ]Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.Let's consider the time difference between Nikita and Yegor.Nikita's time: ( frac{S - R}{6} )Yegor's time: ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} )Since Nikita arrives on time and Yegor doesn't, we have:[ frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} ]Let me solve this inequality step by step.First, subtract ( frac{R}{12} ) from both sides:[ frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} - frac{R}{12} ]Combine the terms on the right side:[ frac{S}{v} > frac{2(S - R) - R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} > frac{2S - 2R - R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} > frac{2S - 3R}{12} ]Now, multiply both sides by ( v ):[ S > frac{2S - 3R}{12} times v ]Multiply both sides by 12:[ 12S > (2S - 3R)v ]Now, divide both sides by ( 2S - 3R ). But wait, I need to be careful here because if ( 2S - 3R ) is positive or negative, the inequality sign might change.Assuming ( 2S - 3R > 0 ), which would mean ( S > frac{3R}{2} ). That seems reasonable because if the distance between stations is more than one and a half times the distance from home to the nearest station, it makes sense.So, dividing both sides by ( 2S - 3R ):[ frac{12S}{2S - 3R} > v ]So, ( v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} )Now, I need to find the maximum integer value of ( v ). But I still have ( S ) and ( R ) in the equation. I need another relation between ( S ) and ( R ).Wait, let's think about the initial setup. The home is located somewhere between two metro stations, right? So, the distance from home to the nearest station is ( R ), and to the farther station is ( S - R ).Now, Nikita walks to the farther station, and Yegor runs to the nearer station. The metro has to cover the distance between the two stations, which is ( S ), at speed ( v ).But how does the timing work? Let's think about the moment they leave home.At time ( t = 0 ), both leave home.Nikita takes ( frac{S - R}{6} ) hours to reach the farther station.Yegor takes ( frac{R}{12} ) hours to reach the nearer station, and then the metro takes ( frac{S}{v} ) hours to reach the farther station.So, the total time for Yegor is ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} ), and for Nikita, it's ( frac{S - R}{6} ).Since Nikita arrives on time and Yegor doesn't, we have:[ frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} ]Which is the same inequality as before.So, solving for ( v ):[ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]Now, I need to express this in terms that can be maximized. Maybe I can express ( R ) in terms of ( S ).Let me assume that the home is located somewhere between the two stations, so ( 0 < R < S ).Let me define ( R = kS ), where ( 0 < k < 1 ).Substituting ( R = kS ) into the inequality:[ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3kS} ][ v < frac{12}{2 - 3k} ]So, ( v < frac{12}{2 - 3k} )Now, to maximize ( v ), I need to minimize the denominator ( 2 - 3k ). Since ( k ) is between 0 and 1, ( 2 - 3k ) will be positive as long as ( k < frac{2}{3} ). If ( k geq frac{2}{3} ), the denominator becomes negative or zero, which would make the inequality undefined or negative, which doesn't make sense for speed.So, ( k < frac{2}{3} ).Therefore, the minimum value of ( 2 - 3k ) is when ( k ) is as large as possible, approaching ( frac{2}{3} ).So, as ( k ) approaches ( frac{2}{3} ), ( 2 - 3k ) approaches ( 2 - 3 times frac{2}{3} = 2 - 2 = 0 ).But we can't have ( k = frac{2}{3} ) because then the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined.So, the maximum value of ( v ) would be just below ( frac{12}{0} ), which is infinity, but that's not practical.Wait, that can't be right. There must be another constraint.Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider the time it takes for the metro to reach Nikita's station after Yegor arrives at his station.So, the metro leaves the nearer station when Yegor arrives, which is at time ( frac{R}{12} ). Then, it takes ( frac{S}{v} ) hours to reach the farther station.Meanwhile, Nikita has been walking the entire time. So, the total time for Nikita is ( frac{S - R}{6} ).For Yegor to not make it, the time when the metro arrives at the farther station must be greater than Nikita's arrival time.So, ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} )Which is the same inequality.But perhaps I need to consider that the metro could leave the farther station before Nikita arrives, but that doesn't make sense because the metro is moving from the nearer to the farther station.Wait, no. The metro is moving from the nearer station to the farther station, so it leaves the nearer station when Yegor arrives, and arrives at the farther station at time ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} ).Nikita arrives at the farther station at time ( frac{S - R}{6} ).So, for Yegor to not make it, the metro's arrival time must be greater than Nikita's arrival time.Thus, ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} )Let me solve this inequality again.Multiply both sides by 12v:[ Rv + 12S > 2v(S - R) ]Expand:[ Rv + 12S > 2vS - 2vR ]Bring all terms to one side:[ Rv + 12S - 2vS + 2vR > 0 ]Combine like terms:[ (Rv + 2vR) + 12S - 2vS > 0 ][ 3vR + 12S - 2vS > 0 ]Factor:[ v(3R - 2S) + 12S > 0 ]Hmm, this is the same as before.Let me rearrange:[ v(3R - 2S) > -12S ]Divide both sides by ( 3R - 2S ). But since ( 3R - 2S ) is negative (because ( R < frac{2}{3}S )), the inequality sign will reverse.So,[ v < frac{-12S}{3R - 2S} ][ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]Which is the same as before.So, ( v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} )Now, to find the maximum integer ( v ), I need to find the maximum value of ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ) given that ( R < frac{2}{3}S ).Let me express this as:[ frac{12S}{2S - 3R} = frac{12}{2 - 3frac{R}{S}} ]Let ( k = frac{R}{S} ), so ( 0 < k < frac{2}{3} ).Then,[ frac{12}{2 - 3k} ]To maximize this expression, we need to minimize the denominator ( 2 - 3k ).The minimum value of ( 2 - 3k ) occurs when ( k ) is maximized, i.e., when ( k ) approaches ( frac{2}{3} ).So, as ( k ) approaches ( frac{2}{3} ), the denominator approaches ( 2 - 3 times frac{2}{3} = 2 - 2 = 0 ), making the expression approach infinity.But that's not practical because the speed can't be infinite. So, there must be another constraint.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Nikita's walking time must be less than the metro's travel time plus Yegor's running time.But I already considered that.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the distance from home to the stations.Let me think about the distances.Nikita walks ( S - R ) at 6 km/h, so his time is ( frac{S - R}{6} ).Yegor runs ( R ) at 12 km/h, so his time is ( frac{R}{12} ).Then, the metro needs to cover ( S ) at speed ( v ), taking ( frac{S}{v} ) hours.So, the total time for Yegor is ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} ).For Nikita to arrive on time, his time must be less than or equal to the metro's arrival time.Wait, no. Nikita arrives on time, but Yegor doesn't. So, Nikita's time is less than the metro's arrival time, but Yegor's total time is more than Nikita's time.Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it.Actually, both leave home at the same time. Nikita walks to the farther station, and Yegor runs to the nearer station. The metro leaves the nearer station when Yegor arrives, and arrives at the farther station at time ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} ).Nikita arrives at the farther station at time ( frac{S - R}{6} ).For Nikita to be on time, the metro must arrive at the farther station after Nikita has already arrived. Wait, no. If the metro arrives after Nikita, then Nikita would have to wait for the metro, but the problem says Nikita always manages to reach on time. So, perhaps the metro arrives before or at the same time as Nikita.Wait, that might not make sense because the metro is moving towards Nikita's station, so it would arrive at the same time as Nikita or earlier.But the problem says Nikita always arrives on time, whereas Yegor does not. So, maybe the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita, but Yegor's total time is more than Nikita's time.Wait, let me clarify.If the metro arrives at the farther station at the same time as Nikita, then Nikita can catch it. But Yegor, who ran to the nearer station, arrives there at ( frac{R}{12} ), then takes the metro which arrives at the farther station at ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} ). For Yegor to not make it, this total time must be greater than Nikita's time.So, ( frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} )Which is the same inequality.So, solving for ( v ):[ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]Now, to find the maximum integer ( v ), I need to find the maximum value of ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ).But I still have two variables, ( S ) and ( R ). I need another relation.Wait, perhaps I can express ( R ) in terms of ( S ) to find the maximum ( v ).Let me assume that ( R ) is as large as possible, which is just less than ( frac{2}{3}S ), because if ( R ) were ( frac{2}{3}S ), the denominator becomes zero.So, let's set ( R = frac{2}{3}S - epsilon ), where ( epsilon ) is a very small positive number.Substituting into the expression for ( v ):[ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3(frac{2}{3}S - epsilon)} ][ v < frac{12S}{2S - 2S + 3epsilon} ][ v < frac{12S}{3epsilon} ]As ( epsilon ) approaches zero, ( v ) approaches infinity, which is not possible.So, this suggests that as ( R ) approaches ( frac{2}{3}S ), the maximum speed ( v ) increases without bound, which is not practical.Therefore, there must be another constraint that I'm missing.Wait, perhaps the distance from home to the stations must be such that Nikita's walking time is less than the metro's travel time.Wait, no. Nikita's walking time is ( frac{S - R}{6} ), and the metro's travel time is ( frac{S}{v} ).But Nikita arrives on time, so perhaps the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita.Wait, if the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita, then:[ frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} = frac{S - R}{6} ]Solving for ( v ):[ frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} = frac{S - R}{6} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{S - R}{6} - frac{R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{2(S - R) - R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{2S - 2R - R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{2S - 3R}{12} ][ v = frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]So, in this case, ( v = frac{12S}{2S - 3R} )But since Yegor doesn't make it, the actual ( v ) must be less than this value.Wait, no. If the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita, then Yegor's total time would be equal to Nikita's time, but the problem says Yegor doesn't make it, so the metro must arrive after Nikita's time.Wait, that contradicts the previous assumption.I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.Let me consider specific values to see if I can find a pattern.Suppose ( S = 12 ) km (just picking a number divisible by 6 and 12 for simplicity).Then, ( R ) is the distance from home to the nearer station, so ( 0 < R < 12 ).Nikita walks ( 12 - R ) km at 6 km/h, so his time is ( frac{12 - R}{6} ) hours.Yegor runs ( R ) km at 12 km/h, so his time is ( frac{R}{12} ) hours.Then, the metro takes ( frac{12}{v} ) hours to go from the nearer to the farther station.So, Yegor's total time is ( frac{R}{12} + frac{12}{v} ).For Yegor to not make it, this total time must be greater than Nikita's time:[ frac{R}{12} + frac{12}{v} > frac{12 - R}{6} ]Let me solve this inequality for ( v ).Multiply both sides by 12v:[ Rv + 144 > 2v(12 - R) ][ Rv + 144 > 24v - 2vR ][ Rv + 144 - 24v + 2vR > 0 ][ 3vR + 144 - 24v > 0 ][ 3vR - 24v + 144 > 0 ][ v(3R - 24) + 144 > 0 ]Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try plugging in some values for ( R ).Suppose ( R = 4 ) km.Then,[ v(12 - 24) + 144 > 0 ][ v(-12) + 144 > 0 ][ -12v + 144 > 0 ][ -12v > -144 ][ v < 12 ]So, maximum integer ( v = 11 ).But is this the maximum possible? Let's try another ( R ).Suppose ( R = 6 ) km.Then,[ v(18 - 24) + 144 > 0 ][ v(-6) + 144 > 0 ][ -6v + 144 > 0 ][ -6v > -144 ][ v < 24 ]So, maximum integer ( v = 23 ).Wait, that's higher than before.Wait, but when ( R = 6 ), which is ( frac{S}{2} ), the midpoint.So, in this case, the maximum ( v ) is 23.But earlier, with ( R = 4 ), it was 11.So, the maximum ( v ) depends on ( R ).But the problem doesn't specify ( R ) or ( S ), so we need to find the maximum possible ( v ) regardless of ( R ) and ( S ).Wait, but ( R ) must be less than ( frac{2}{3}S ) to keep the denominator positive.So, if ( R ) approaches ( frac{2}{3}S ), then ( v ) can be very large, but in reality, we need to find the maximum integer ( v ) such that for some ( R ) and ( S ), the inequality holds.But the problem says \\"the maximum possible speed\\", so we need to find the highest integer ( v ) that satisfies the inequality for some ( R ) and ( S ).So, perhaps the maximum ( v ) is 23, as in the case when ( R = 6 ) and ( S = 12 ).But let's check with ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ):Nikita walks ( 6 ) km at 6 km/h, taking 1 hour.Yegor runs ( 6 ) km at 12 km/h, taking 0.5 hours.Then, the metro takes ( frac{12}{v} ) hours to go from the nearer to the farther station.So, Yegor's total time is ( 0.5 + frac{12}{v} ).For Yegor to not make it, this must be greater than 1 hour:[ 0.5 + frac{12}{v} > 1 ][ frac{12}{v} > 0.5 ][ v < 24 ]So, maximum integer ( v = 23 ).This seems to make sense.But let's check with another ( S ) and ( R ).Suppose ( S = 24 ) km, and ( R = 16 ) km (which is ( frac{2}{3} times 24 )).Then, Nikita walks ( 8 ) km at 6 km/h, taking ( frac{8}{6} = frac{4}{3} ) hours ≈ 1.333 hours.Yegor runs ( 16 ) km at 12 km/h, taking ( frac{16}{12} = frac{4}{3} ) hours ≈ 1.333 hours.Then, the metro takes ( frac{24}{v} ) hours to go from the nearer to the farther station.So, Yegor's total time is ( frac{4}{3} + frac{24}{v} ).For Yegor to not make it, this must be greater than ( frac{4}{3} ) hours:[ frac{4}{3} + frac{24}{v} > frac{4}{3} ][ frac{24}{v} > 0 ]Which is always true for positive ( v ). So, in this case, Yegor's total time is always greater than Nikita's time, regardless of ( v ).But this seems contradictory because if ( R = frac{2}{3}S ), then ( 2S - 3R = 2 times 24 - 3 times 16 = 48 - 48 = 0 ), which makes the expression for ( v ) undefined.So, perhaps ( R ) cannot be exactly ( frac{2}{3}S ), but must be less than that.So, if ( R ) is slightly less than ( frac{2}{3}S ), then ( v ) can be very large, but in reality, we need to find the maximum integer ( v ) such that for some ( R ) and ( S ), the inequality holds.But from the earlier example with ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ), we got ( v < 24 ), so maximum ( v = 23 ).Is this the maximum possible?Let me check with ( S = 18 ) km and ( R = 12 ) km (which is ( frac{2}{3} times 18 )).Nikita walks ( 6 ) km at 6 km/h, taking 1 hour.Yegor runs ( 12 ) km at 12 km/h, taking 1 hour.Then, the metro takes ( frac{18}{v} ) hours to go from the nearer to the farther station.So, Yegor's total time is ( 1 + frac{18}{v} ).For Yegor to not make it, this must be greater than 1 hour:[ 1 + frac{18}{v} > 1 ][ frac{18}{v} > 0 ]Again, always true, but the expression for ( v ) becomes:[ v < frac{12 times 18}{2 times 18 - 3 times 12} ][ v < frac{216}{36 - 36} ][ v < frac{216}{0} ]Undefined.So, again, ( R ) must be less than ( frac{2}{3}S ).So, perhaps the maximum ( v ) is 23, as in the case when ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ).But let's see if we can get a higher ( v ) with different ( S ) and ( R ).Suppose ( S = 6 ) km, ( R = 4 ) km.Nikita walks ( 2 ) km at 6 km/h, taking ( frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} ) hours ≈ 20 minutes.Yegor runs ( 4 ) km at 12 km/h, taking ( frac{4}{12} = frac{1}{3} ) hours ≈ 20 minutes.Then, the metro takes ( frac{6}{v} ) hours to go from the nearer to the farther station.So, Yegor's total time is ( frac{1}{3} + frac{6}{v} ).For Yegor to not make it, this must be greater than ( frac{1}{3} ) hours:[ frac{1}{3} + frac{6}{v} > frac{1}{3} ][ frac{6}{v} > 0 ]Again, always true, but the expression for ( v ):[ v < frac{12 times 6}{2 times 6 - 3 times 4} ][ v < frac{72}{12 - 12} ][ v < frac{72}{0} ]Undefined.So, again, ( R ) must be less than ( frac{2}{3}S ).Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the original inequality:[ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]To maximize ( v ), we need to maximize ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ).This expression is maximized when ( 2S - 3R ) is minimized, i.e., when ( R ) is as large as possible, approaching ( frac{2}{3}S ).So, as ( R ) approaches ( frac{2}{3}S ), ( 2S - 3R ) approaches zero, making ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ) approach infinity.But since ( v ) must be a finite integer, we need to find the maximum ( v ) such that there exists some ( R ) and ( S ) where ( v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ).But without specific values for ( S ) and ( R ), we can't determine an exact maximum ( v ). However, the problem asks for the maximum possible speed, so we need to find the highest integer ( v ) that satisfies the inequality for some ( S ) and ( R ).From the earlier example with ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ), we saw that ( v < 24 ), so the maximum integer ( v = 23 ).Is this the maximum possible? Let's see.Suppose ( S = 24 ) km, ( R = 16 ) km (which is ( frac{2}{3} times 24 )).Then,[ v < frac{12 times 24}{2 times 24 - 3 times 16} ][ v < frac{288}{48 - 48} ][ v < frac{288}{0} ]Undefined.But if ( R = 15 ) km, which is less than ( frac{2}{3} times 24 = 16 ) km,Then,[ v < frac{12 times 24}{2 times 24 - 3 times 15} ][ v < frac{288}{48 - 45} ][ v < frac{288}{3} ][ v < 96 ]So, maximum integer ( v = 95 ).Wait, that's much higher than 23.But this seems contradictory because earlier with ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ), ( v < 24 ).So, perhaps the maximum ( v ) depends on the ratio of ( R ) to ( S ).But the problem doesn't specify ( R ) or ( S ), so we need to find the maximum possible ( v ) regardless of ( R ) and ( S ).Wait, but if ( R ) can be as small as possible, then ( 2S - 3R ) can be as large as possible, making ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ) as small as possible.But we need the maximum ( v ), so we need to find the maximum possible ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ), which occurs when ( R ) is as large as possible, approaching ( frac{2}{3}S ).So, as ( R ) approaches ( frac{2}{3}S ), ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ) approaches infinity, but since ( v ) must be an integer, the maximum possible ( v ) is unbounded, which doesn't make sense.Therefore, there must be another constraint that I'm missing.Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the home is located between two stations, so ( R ) and ( S - R ) are both positive, but there's no upper limit on ( S ).But in reality, metro systems have stations spaced at certain intervals, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on ( S ).Wait, maybe I need to consider that the time it takes for the metro to reach the farther station must be greater than the time Nikita takes to walk there.So,[ frac{S}{v} > frac{S - R}{6} ]But this is not necessarily true because Nikita arrives on time, which might mean that the metro arrives at the same time or earlier.Wait, no. If the metro arrives earlier, Nikita would have to wait, but the problem says Nikita always arrives on time. So, perhaps the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita.Wait, let me think.If the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita, then:[ frac{R}{12} + frac{S}{v} = frac{S - R}{6} ]Solving for ( v ):[ frac{S}{v} = frac{S - R}{6} - frac{R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{2(S - R) - R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{2S - 2R - R}{12} ][ frac{S}{v} = frac{2S - 3R}{12} ][ v = frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]So, in this case, ( v = frac{12S}{2S - 3R} )But since Yegor doesn't make it, the actual ( v ) must be less than this value.Wait, no. If the metro arrives at the same time as Nikita, then Yegor's total time would be equal to Nikita's time, but the problem says Yegor doesn't make it, so the metro must arrive after Nikita's time.Wait, that contradicts the previous assumption.I think I'm stuck here. Let me try to summarize.From the inequality:[ v < frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ]To find the maximum integer ( v ), we need to find the maximum value of ( frac{12S}{2S - 3R} ).This expression is maximized when ( 2S - 3R ) is minimized, i.e., when ( R ) is as large as possible, approaching ( frac{2}{3}S ).But as ( R ) approaches ( frac{2}{3}S ), the expression approaches infinity, which is not practical.Therefore, the maximum possible ( v ) is unbounded, but since the problem asks for an integer, and in the example with ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ), ( v < 24 ), so the maximum integer ( v = 23 ).But earlier, with ( S = 24 ) and ( R = 15 ), ( v < 96 ), so maximum ( v = 95 ).This suggests that the maximum ( v ) can be very large, depending on ( S ) and ( R ).But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on ( S ) or ( R ), so perhaps the answer is that the maximum possible speed is 23 km/h, as in the case when ( S = 12 ) and ( R = 6 ).Alternatively, maybe the answer is 23 km/h because it's the highest integer less than 24, which is derived from the case when ( R = frac{S}{2} ).I think the answer is 23 km/h."},{"question":"Construct a triangle given an angle, the side opposite the angle and the median to the other side (researching the number of solutions is not required).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem where I need to construct a triangle given an angle, the side opposite that angle, and the median to the other side. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I'm given:1. An angle, let's call it angle A.2. The side opposite angle A, which would be side BC in triangle ABC.3. The median to the other side. Wait, the \\"other side\\" – does that mean the side that's not opposite the given angle? So if angle A is given, and side BC is opposite angle A, then the \\"other side\\" would be either AB or AC. But since the median is to the other side, I think it means the median from the vertex opposite the given side. So if side BC is given, the median would be from vertex A to the midpoint of BC. Hmm, that makes sense.So, to recap, I need to construct triangle ABC where:- Angle A is given.- Side BC is given (opposite angle A).- The median from A to the midpoint of BC is given.Alright, let's denote some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:- Angle A = α- Length of side BC = a- Length of the median from A to BC = m_aSo, I need to construct triangle ABC with these given values.Now, how do I approach this? Well, I know that in triangle construction problems, we often use basic geometric constructions like drawing lines, circles, and using compass and straightedge techniques. Since I'm given an angle, a side, and a median, I need to figure out how to incorporate all these into the construction.Let me start by recalling some properties of medians in triangles. The median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, in this case, the median from A will meet BC at its midpoint, let's call it M.So, point M is the midpoint of BC, meaning BM = MC = a/2.Now, I have the length of the median, m_a, which is the length from A to M. So, if I can locate point A such that its distance to M is m_a, and angle at A is α, then I can construct the triangle.Hmm, so maybe I can use the following steps:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find the midpoint M of BC.3. Construct a circle with center at M and radius m_a. This circle will represent all possible points A such that the median from A to BC is m_a.4. Now, I need to ensure that angle BAC is equal to α. So, perhaps I can construct an angle α at point A and see where it intersects the circle.Wait, but I don't know where point A is yet. So, maybe I need to approach this differently.Alternatively, I can use the Law of Cosines or the Law of Sines to relate the sides and angles, but since this is a construction problem, I need a geometric approach.Let me think about the properties of triangle medians. There's a formula that relates the length of a median to the sides of the triangle. The formula is:m_a = (1/2) * sqrt(2b² + 2c² - a²)Where b and c are the lengths of the other two sides.But in this case, I don't know sides AB and AC, so maybe this isn't directly helpful. However, perhaps I can use this formula to find a relationship between the sides.Wait, but since I'm constructing the triangle, maybe I can use this formula to find the lengths of AB and AC if needed.Alternatively, I can use coordinate geometry to model the problem. Let me try that.Let's place point B at the origin (0,0) and point C at (a,0). Then, the midpoint M of BC is at (a/2, 0).Now, point A is somewhere in the plane, and the distance from A to M is m_a. So, the coordinates of A must satisfy the equation:(x - a/2)² + y² = m_a²Additionally, angle BAC is α. So, the angle between vectors AB and AC is α.Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but maybe I can set up equations based on these conditions.First, let's denote the coordinates of A as (x,y). Then, vectors AB and AC can be represented as:AB = (x - 0, y - 0) = (x, y)AC = (x - a, y - 0) = (x - a, y)The angle between AB and AC is α, so using the dot product formula:cos(α) = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)Calculating the dot product:AB · AC = x(x - a) + y * y = x² - a x + y²The magnitudes:|AB| = sqrt(x² + y²)|AC| = sqrt((x - a)² + y²)So,cos(α) = (x² - a x + y²) / (sqrt(x² + y²) * sqrt((x - a)² + y²))This seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, I also know that point A lies on the circle centered at M with radius m_a. So, (x - a/2)² + y² = m_a².Maybe I can use this to express y² in terms of x:y² = m_a² - (x - a/2)²Then, substitute this into the dot product equation.So,cos(α) = (x² - a x + (m_a² - (x - a/2)²)) / (sqrt(x² + (m_a² - (x - a/2)²)) * sqrt((x - a)² + (m_a² - (x - a/2)²)))This is getting really messy. Maybe coordinate geometry isn't the best approach here.Let me think about another method. Perhaps using the concept of loci. The set of all points A such that the median from A to BC is m_a is a circle with center at M and radius m_a. Additionally, the set of all points A such that angle BAC is α is another locus, specifically a circular arc.So, the intersection of these two loci will give me the possible positions of point A.Therefore, the construction steps could be:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find the midpoint M of BC.3. Draw a circle centered at M with radius m_a.4. Construct the locus of points A such that angle BAC is α. This is typically done by constructing an angle α at point A, but since A is variable, it's a bit tricky.Wait, actually, the locus of points A such that angle BAC is α is a circular arc with BC as a chord. The center of this circle can be found by constructing the angle α at some point and finding the circumcircle.But I'm not sure about the exact construction here.Alternatively, I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the median m_a, side BC, and angle A are related. Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABM or ACM.Wait, since M is the midpoint of BC, BM = MC = a/2.In triangle ABM, we have sides AB, BM = a/2, and median AM = m_a. Similarly, in triangle ACM, we have sides AC, CM = a/2, and median AM = m_a.So, perhaps I can apply the Law of Cosines in triangle ABM or ACM.Let me try that.In triangle ABM:AB² = AM² + BM² - 2 * AM * BM * cos(angle at M)But I don't know angle at M. Hmm.Alternatively, in triangle ABM, we have sides AB, BM, and AM, but we don't know any angles.Wait, but in triangle ABC, we know angle A = α. Maybe we can relate this to triangle ABM.Alternatively, perhaps using vector geometry or coordinate geometry is necessary, but I was hoping for a more straightforward geometric construction.Wait, maybe I can use the following approach:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find midpoint M of BC.3. Draw a circle with center M and radius m_a. This is the locus of point A.4. Now, I need to ensure that angle BAC = α. To do this, I can construct an angle α at point A such that it subtends side BC.But since point A is on the circle centered at M, I need to find the intersection of this circle with the locus of points where angle BAC = α.Alternatively, I can construct the circumcircle of triangle ABC, knowing angle A and side BC. But I don't know the other sides.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the circumradius R is related to side BC and angle A by the formula:a / sin(α) = 2RSo, R = a / (2 sin(α))Therefore, the circumradius is known, and the circumcircle can be constructed with center at the circumradius distance from BC.But I also have the median m_a. So, point A lies on both the circumcircle and the circle centered at M with radius m_a.Therefore, the intersection of these two circles will give me point A.So, the construction steps would be:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find the midpoint M of BC.3. Construct the circumcircle of triangle ABC with center O. To find O, I need to construct the perpendicular bisectors of BC and another side, but since I don't have another side, maybe I can use the fact that the circumradius R = a / (2 sin(α)).Wait, but without knowing another side, it's difficult to find the exact position of O.Alternatively, since I know angle A and side BC, I can construct the circumcircle as follows:- Draw side BC.- At point B, construct an angle of α/2, and at point C, construct an angle of α/2. The intersection of these two lines will give the circumcircle center O.Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me recall that the circumcircle can be constructed by finding the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of two sides.But since I only have side BC, I need another side or some other information.Alternatively, since I know angle A, I can construct the circumcircle by knowing that the center lies at a distance R = a / (2 sin(α)) from BC.But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.Wait, maybe I can use the following method:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find midpoint M of BC.3. Draw circle ω1 centered at M with radius m_a.4. Construct the circumcircle ω2 of triangle ABC, knowing angle A and side BC.But to construct ω2, I need to find its center. Since I know angle A and side BC, I can use the fact that the circumradius R = a / (2 sin(α)).So, the center O of the circumcircle lies at a distance R from BC. But I need to find the exact position.Wait, the circumcircle center lies at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. Since I only have side BC, I need another side or another perpendicular bisector.Alternatively, I can construct the angle bisector of angle A, but since I don't know where A is yet, that's not helpful.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the median m_a, side BC, and angle A are related through the formula involving the median length.The formula for the length of the median is:m_a = (1/2) * sqrt(2b² + 2c² - a²)Where b and c are the lengths of the other two sides.But I don't know b and c, so maybe I can express them in terms of the given angle α.Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos(α)So, I have two equations:1. m_a = (1/2) * sqrt(2b² + 2c² - a²)2. a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos(α)Maybe I can solve these equations simultaneously to find b and c.Let me square both sides of the first equation:m_a² = (1/4) * (2b² + 2c² - a²)Multiply both sides by 4:4m_a² = 2b² + 2c² - a²So,2b² + 2c² = 4m_a² + a²Divide both sides by 2:b² + c² = 2m_a² + (a²)/2Now, from the Law of Cosines:a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos(α)Substitute b² + c² from the previous equation:a² = (2m_a² + (a²)/2) - 2bc cos(α)Simplify:a² = 2m_a² + (a²)/2 - 2bc cos(α)Subtract (a²)/2 from both sides:(a²)/2 = 2m_a² - 2bc cos(α)Divide both sides by 2:(a²)/4 = m_a² - bc cos(α)So,bc cos(α) = m_a² - (a²)/4Therefore,bc = (m_a² - (a²)/4) / cos(α)Hmm, interesting. So, I have an expression for bc in terms of the given quantities.But I still have two variables, b and c, so I need another equation to solve for them.Wait, from the Law of Sines, we have:a / sin(α) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C) = 2RWhere R is the circumradius.But I don't know angles B and C, so that might not help directly.Alternatively, I can express b and c in terms of each other using the Law of Cosines.From the Law of Cosines:a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos(α)We already have b² + c² = 2m_a² + (a²)/2So, substituting:a² = (2m_a² + (a²)/2) - 2bc cos(α)Which simplifies to:a² = 2m_a² + (a²)/2 - 2bc cos(α)Which is the same as before, leading to:bc = (m_a² - (a²)/4) / cos(α)So, I'm stuck here because I have bc expressed in terms of m_a, a, and cos(α), but I still need another equation to find b and c individually.Maybe I can assume some value for one of the sides and solve for the other, but that doesn't seem helpful in a construction problem.Wait, perhaps instead of trying to find the lengths of b and c, I can use the geometric construction approach.Let me try to outline the steps again:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find midpoint M of BC.3. Draw circle ω1 centered at M with radius m_a.4. Now, I need to construct point A such that angle BAC = α and A lies on ω1.To construct angle BAC = α, I can use the following method:- At point B, draw a line making an angle of α/2 with BC.- At point C, draw a line making an angle of α/2 with BC.- The intersection of these two lines will give the circumcircle center O.Wait, no, that's not quite right. The angle subtended by BC at point A is α, so the locus of point A is a circular arc with BC as a chord.The center of this circle can be found by constructing the perpendicular bisector of BC and then finding the point at a distance R = a / (2 sin(α)) from BC.But I'm not sure how to integrate this with the circle ω1.Alternatively, maybe I can use the following steps:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find midpoint M of BC.3. Draw circle ω1 centered at M with radius m_a.4. Construct the circumcircle ω2 of triangle ABC with angle BAC = α and side BC = a.5. The intersection of ω1 and ω2 will give point A.But to construct ω2, I need to know its center. Since I know angle A and side BC, I can find the circumradius R = a / (2 sin(α)).So, the center O of ω2 lies at a distance R from BC. To find O, I can construct a line perpendicular to BC at its midpoint, and then measure a distance R from BC along this perpendicular.Wait, that makes sense. The circumradius is perpendicular to BC at its midpoint if and only if the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC. But in general, the circumradius is not necessarily perpendicular unless the triangle is isoceles.Wait, no, the circumradius is the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex, not necessarily along the perpendicular bisector.Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.Let me recall that the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. Since I only have side BC, I need another side or another perpendicular bisector to find the circumcenter.But since I don't have another side, maybe I can use the fact that angle BAC = α to find another condition.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the following method:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find midpoint M of BC.3. Draw circle ω1 centered at M with radius m_a.4. At point B, construct an angle of α/2 above BC.5. At point C, construct an angle of α/2 above BC.6. The intersection of these two lines is the circumcenter O.7. Draw the circumcircle ω2 with center O passing through B and C.8. The intersection of ω1 and ω2 will give point A.Wait, that seems plausible. Let me try to visualize this.By constructing angles of α/2 at points B and C, the lines will intersect at the circumcenter O. Then, the circumcircle ω2 will pass through B and C, and point A will lie on both ω1 and ω2.Yes, that makes sense. So, the steps would be:1. Draw side BC with length a.2. Find midpoint M of BC.3. Draw circle ω1 centered at M with radius m_a.4. At point B, construct an angle of α/2 above BC.5. At point C, construct an angle of α/2 above BC.6. Let the two lines intersect at point O, which is the circumcenter.7. Draw the circumcircle ω2 with center O passing through B and C.8. The intersection points of ω1 and ω2 are the possible positions for point A.9. Choose one of the intersection points as A, and complete the triangle ABC.This seems like a feasible construction method. Let me summarize the steps clearly:1. Draw segment BC with the given length a.2. Locate the midpoint M of BC.3. Using M as the center, draw a circle ω1 with radius equal to the given median m_a.4. At point B, construct an angle of measure α/2 above side BC.5. At point C, construct an angle of measure α/2 above side BC.6. The intersection of these two angle bisectors is the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.7. Draw the circumcircle ω2 with center O passing through points B and C.8. The points where ω1 and ω2 intersect are the possible locations for vertex A.9. Select one of these intersection points as A and connect it to B and C to form triangle ABC.This construction ensures that:- Side BC has length a.- The median from A to BC is m_a (since A lies on ω1).- Angle BAC is α (since A lies on ω2).Therefore, triangle ABC satisfies all the given conditions.I think this approach works. It combines the given median with the given angle to locate point A correctly. The intersection of the two circles gives the necessary constraints to determine the position of A.I should also consider whether there might be two solutions, as circles can intersect at two points. However, the problem statement mentions that researching the number of solutions is not required, so I don't need to worry about that for this construction.In summary, the key steps are:- Constructing the circle for the median.- Constructing the circumcircle based on the given angle.- Finding their intersection to locate vertex A.This method should successfully construct the desired triangle given the angle, the opposite side, and the median to the other side."},{"question":"Let ( n ) be a positive integer, and let ( p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_k < p_{k+1} ) be consecutive prime numbers such that ( p_k leq n < p_{k+1} ).

Prove that for all positive integers ( n ), the following inequality holds:[G(P(n) + n) geq m.]","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about primes and residues, and I need to prove an inequality involving the gap between consecutive primes and some maximum integer m. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let's parse the definitions. We have a positive integer n, and a sequence of consecutive primes p₁ < p₂ < ... < p_k < p_{k+1} such that p_k ≤ n < p_{k+1}. So, p_k is the largest prime less than or equal to n, and p_{k+1} is the next prime after n.Then, P(n) is defined as the product of all these primes up to p_k. That is, P(n) = p₁ * p₂ * ... * p_k. Got that.Next, G(n) is the maximum gap between consecutive primes in the sequence from p₁ to p_{k+1}. So, G(n) = max{p_i - p_{i-1} | 2 ≤ i ≤ k+1}. This measures the largest difference between two consecutive primes in that range.Now, the main part is defining m. It's the largest integer such that for each prime p_i (from 1 to k), there's a residue class a_{p_i} mod p_i, and the set of these residues covers {1, 2, ..., m}. So, m is the maximum number where each number from 1 to m can be expressed as a residue modulo some prime p_i in the sequence.The goal is to prove that G(P(n) + n) ≥ m. That is, the maximum gap between consecutive primes in the sequence up to P(n) + n is at least m.Hmm, okay. Let's think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here since we're dealing with residues modulo different primes. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that if we have a system of congruences with pairwise coprime moduli, there's a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli.Given that P(n) is the product of primes up to p_k, if we can find a number x such that x ≡ -a_{p_i} mod p_i for each p_i, then x would be a number that, when added to each a_{p_i}, gives a multiple of p_i. That might be useful.Wait, the problem mentions that these residues cover {1, 2, ..., m}. So, for each number from 1 to m, there's some prime p_i such that the number is congruent to a_{p_i} mod p_i. That means that if we take x ≡ -a_{p_i} mod p_i for each p_i, then x + t ≡ 0 mod p_i for some p_i whenever t is in {1, 2, ..., m}. Therefore, x + t would be divisible by p_i, making it composite.So, if x is such a number, then x + 1, x + 2, ..., x + m are all composite. That means there's a sequence of m consecutive composite numbers starting at x + 1. The length of this sequence is m, which is the largest such m possible given the residues.Now, the next prime after x + m would be at least x + m + 1. But x is related to P(n) and n. Specifically, x is constructed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem with moduli up to p_k, so x is less than or equal to P(n). But we also have n < x ≤ n + P(n). Hmm, that might need some clarification.Wait, actually, if x is constructed as a solution to the system x ≡ -a_{p_i} mod p_i, then x is congruent to some number modulo P(n). So, x can be as large as P(n), but since we're looking for the smallest such x, it's likely that x is around n or something like that. Maybe x is close to n?But regardless, the key point is that x + 1 to x + m are composite. So, the gap between the prime before x + 1 and the prime after x + m must be at least m. Because if there were a prime in that range, it would contradict the fact that all numbers from x + 1 to x + m are composite.Therefore, the maximum gap G(P(n) + n) must be at least m. That seems to be the crux of the argument.Let me try to formalize this a bit more. Suppose we have x such that x + t is composite for all t from 1 to m. Then, the next prime after x must be at least x + m + 1. Therefore, the gap between x and the next prime is at least m. But x is related to P(n) and n, so we need to connect this to G(P(n) + n).Wait, actually, P(n) is the product of primes up to p_k, and n is less than p_{k+1}. So, P(n) is significantly larger than n, especially as n increases. Therefore, P(n) + n is a number that's just a bit larger than P(n). The primes around P(n) + n would be influenced by the gaps between primes up to that point.But I'm not entirely sure how to directly connect x to P(n) + n. Maybe x is constructed in such a way that it's close to P(n) + n, or perhaps x is exactly P(n) + n. Let me think.If x is constructed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem with moduli up to p_k, then x is congruent to -a_{p_i} mod p_i for each p_i. So, x could be as large as P(n), but since we're looking for the minimal x, it's more likely that x is congruent to some number less than P(n). However, since n is less than p_{k+1}, and P(n) is the product of primes up to p_k, which is much larger than n, x could be in the vicinity of P(n).But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key idea is that the existence of m consecutive composite numbers implies that the gap between primes is at least m. Since we've constructed such a sequence starting at x + 1, the gap between the prime before x + 1 and the prime after x + m must be at least m. Therefore, G(P(n) + n), which is the maximum gap in that range, must be at least m.I think that's the main argument. Maybe I need to make sure that x + m is less than P(n) + n or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps x is chosen such that x + m is around P(n) + n, ensuring that the gap G(P(n) + n) captures this m-length gap.Alternatively, maybe it's simpler: since we've constructed m consecutive composites, the maximum gap G(n) must be at least m, regardless of where exactly x is. So, as long as we've shown that such a sequence of m composites exists, the maximum gap must be at least m.Yeah, I think that's the right approach. The construction of x ensures that there's a sequence of m composites, so the maximum gap between primes in that region must be at least m. Therefore, G(P(n) + n) ≥ m.I should probably write this out more formally, step by step, to make sure all the logic holds and there are no gaps in the reasoning. But overall, I think the key idea is using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to construct a sequence of m composites, which implies a gap of at least m between primes, hence proving the required inequality."},{"question":"How many distinct triangles can be drawn using three of the dots below as vertices?[asy]dot(origin^^(1,0)^^(2,0)^^(3,0)^^(0,1)^^(1,1)^^(2,1)^^(3,1));[/asy]textbf{(A)} 32qquadtextbf{(B)} 40qquadtextbf{(C)} 44qquadtextbf{(D)} 48qquadtextbf{(E)} 56","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here asking how many distinct triangles can be drawn using three of the given dots as vertices. The dots are arranged in a grid, specifically a 2x4 grid, meaning there are 2 rows and 4 columns of dots. The Asymptote code is provided, but since I'm more familiar with visualizing grids, I can imagine it as two rows of four dots each, aligned vertically.First, I need to recall that a triangle is defined by three non-collinear points. So, if I can find all possible combinations of three points and then subtract the ones that are collinear, I should get the number of distinct triangles.Let me start by calculating the total number of ways to choose three points out of the eight available. This is a combination problem, so I can use the combination formula:[binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}]Here, ( n = 8 ) (since there are 8 dots) and ( k = 3 ) (since we need three points to form a triangle). Plugging these values in:[binom{8}{3} = frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56]So, there are 56 possible ways to choose three points. However, not all of these will form a triangle because some sets of three points might be collinear.Now, I need to figure out how many sets of three points are collinear. In a grid, points can be collinear in rows, columns, or diagonals. Let's examine each case.**1. Collinear Points in Rows:**Looking at the grid, there are two rows, each containing four points. In each row, how many ways can three points be collinear? Since all points in a row are aligned horizontally, any three points chosen from a row will be collinear.For each row, the number of ways to choose three collinear points is:[binom{4}{3} = 4]Since there are two rows, the total number of collinear sets in rows is:[2 times 4 = 8]**2. Collinear Points in Columns:**Next, let's consider the columns. There are four columns, each containing two points. Wait a minute, if each column only has two points, how can three points be collinear in a column? It's impossible because we don't have three points in a single column. So, there are no collinear sets of three points in the columns.**3. Collinear Points in Diagonals:**Now, let's check for diagonals. In a 2x4 grid, the diagonals can be of two types: those with a positive slope and those with a negative slope.Starting with positive slope diagonals (going from bottom-left to top-right):- The main diagonals in a 2x4 grid can have at most two points. For example, starting from the first point in the bottom row, the diagonal would go to the second point in the top row, but that's only two points. Similarly, starting from the second point in the bottom row, the diagonal would go to the third point in the top row, again only two points. The same applies to other diagonals. Therefore, no three points are collinear along a positive slope diagonal.Now, checking negative slope diagonals (going from top-left to bottom-right):- Similarly, these diagonals also have at most two points. For instance, starting from the first point in the top row, the diagonal goes to the second point in the bottom row, which is only two points. The same pattern follows for other diagonals. Hence, no three points are collinear along a negative slope diagonal either.So, combining the above, the only collinear sets of three points are those lying in the rows. We found 8 such sets.**Calculating the Number of Triangles:**Now, subtracting the collinear sets from the total combinations:[56 - 8 = 48]Wait, hold on. The answer I got is 48, but looking back at the options, 48 is one of them (option D). However, I recall that sometimes in these grid problems, there might be other sets of collinear points that aren't immediately obvious, especially in larger grids or with different configurations.Let me double-check my reasoning. I considered rows and columns, and diagonals. In rows, I found 8 collinear triplets. In columns, none because each column only has two points. In diagonals, none because each diagonal only has two points. So, 8 collinear sets in total.But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me visualize the grid again:- Row 1: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)- Row 2: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)So, each row has four points. Columns have two points each. Diagonals have two points each.Is there any other way three points can be collinear? For instance, points that are not in the same row or column but still lie on a straight line.In a 2x4 grid, the only straight lines possible are horizontal (rows), vertical (columns), and diagonals. Since rows have four points, columns have two, and diagonals have two, the only sets with three collinear points are the rows.Therefore, my initial calculation seems correct: 56 total combinations minus 8 collinear sets equals 48 triangles.But wait, the answer choices are 32, 40, 44, 48, 56. So, 48 is an option, but I recall that sometimes in these problems, people might consider other configurations or perhaps I made a mistake in counting.Let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider all possible lines, not just rows and columns. For example, lines with different slopes.In a 2x4 grid, besides horizontal and vertical lines, the possible slopes for lines connecting three points could be 1/1, 2/1, 1/2, etc. But in a 2x4 grid, the maximum change in y is 1 (since there are only two rows), so the slopes can only be 0 (horizontal), undefined (vertical), or 1 or -1 (diagonal).Wait, but with only two rows, the diagonals can only have a slope of 1 or -1, but as I saw earlier, each diagonal only has two points. So, no three points on a diagonal.Therefore, my initial conclusion remains: only rows contribute to collinear triplets, with 8 such sets.So, 56 total combinations minus 8 collinear sets equals 48 triangles.But hold on, the answer I initially thought was 44, which is option C. Maybe I'm missing something here.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the collinear sets. Let me recount.In each row, there are four points. The number of ways to choose three collinear points in a row is (binom{4}{3} = 4). Since there are two rows, 4 x 2 = 8. That seems correct.But, wait, is there a possibility of three points being collinear in a different way, not just in rows? For example, in a 2x4 grid, can three points lie on a straight line that's not aligned with the grid lines?Let me think. If I pick points (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2), but wait, in a 2x4 grid, the y-coordinate only goes up to 1, so (2,2) doesn't exist. Similarly, points like (0,1), (1,0), (2,-1) would go out of the grid.Alternatively, is there a line with a different slope that passes through three points?For example, a line with slope 2: starting at (0,0), the next point would be (1,2), but y=2 is beyond the grid. Similarly, starting at (1,0), next would be (2,2), which is out of the grid.A line with slope 1/2: starting at (0,0), next would be (2,1), which is within the grid, but then the next point would be (4,2), which is beyond the grid. So, only two points on that line.Similarly, starting at (0,1), slope 1/2 would go to (2,2), which is out of the grid.So, no, there are no three points in this grid that lie on a straight line with a slope other than 0, undefined, 1, or -1. And as we saw, slopes 1 and -1 only have two points each.Therefore, my initial conclusion holds: only 8 collinear triplets.So, 56 total combinations minus 8 collinear sets equals 48 triangles.But the answer isn't matching my initial thought of 44. Maybe I need to consider something else.Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the Asymptote code, the grid is not 2x4 but 4x2? Let me check the Asymptote code again:dot(origin^(1,0)^(2,0)^(3,0)^(0,1)^(1,1)^(2,1)^(3,1));So, the points are:(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0),(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1).So, it's indeed 2 rows (y=0 and y=1) with 4 points each (x=0,1,2,3). So, it's a 2x4 grid.Therefore, my earlier reasoning is correct.Wait, but maybe the answer is 44 because the problem is considering only non-degenerate triangles, and perhaps some of the triangles are congruent or something? But the question is about distinct triangles, not congruent triangles. So, each set of three non-collinear points forms a distinct triangle, regardless of its shape or size.Therefore, my calculation of 48 should be correct. But 48 is option D, but I thought the answer was 44. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the collinear sets.Wait, let me recount the collinear sets.In each row, there are four points. The number of ways to choose three points is 4. So, two rows give 8.But, wait, in the columns, each column has two points, so you can't choose three points from a column. So, no collinear sets in columns.In diagonals, as we saw, each diagonal has at most two points, so no three collinear points there.Therefore, only 8 collinear sets.So, 56 - 8 = 48.But the answer choices are A)32, B)40, C)44, D)48, E)56.So, 48 is an option, D.But I thought the answer was 44. Maybe I was confusing it with another problem.Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the Asymptote code, the grid is not 2x4 but 4x2? No, the code has x from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to 1, so it's 4 columns and 2 rows.Wait, maybe I miscounted the total number of points. Let's see:From the Asymptote code: origin^(1,0)^(2,0)^(3,0)^(0,1)^(1,1)^(2,1)^(3,1).So, that's 8 points: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). So, 8 points total.So, (binom{8}{3} = 56). That's correct.Collinear sets: 8.So, 56 - 8 = 48.Therefore, the answer should be 48, which is D.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial problem statement. Let me check again.The problem says: \\"How many distinct triangles can be drawn using three of the dots below as vertices?\\"And the Asymptote code is: dot(origin^(1,0)^(2,0)^(3,0)^(0,1)^(1,1)^(2,1)^(3,1));So, it's 8 points arranged in two rows of four.So, my calculation seems correct.But wait, maybe the answer is 44 because the problem is considering only triangles with positive area, but that's the same as non-collinear points, which I already considered.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering triangles with vertices in a specific orientation or something else, but I don't think so.Wait, maybe I miscounted the collinear sets. Let me think again.In each row, four points. Number of ways to choose three: 4. Two rows: 8.But, wait, in the first row, the points are (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0). The number of ways to choose three: 4.Similarly, in the second row: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). Also 4 ways.So, total collinear sets: 8.Therefore, 56 - 8 = 48.So, the answer should be 48, which is D.But I initially thought it was 44. Maybe I was confusing it with another problem where there were more collinear sets.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that some triangles are congruent and thus not distinct, but the question says \\"distinct triangles,\\" which usually means different sets of points, not necessarily non-congruent.Therefore, I think my calculation is correct: 48 triangles.But wait, let me check the answer choices again: A)32, B)40, C)44, D)48, E)56.So, 48 is an option, D.Therefore, I think the correct answer is D)48.But I'm a bit confused because I thought it was 44. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial reasoning.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is considering that some triangles are not valid because they are degenerate in some other way, but no, degenerate triangles are only those with collinear points, which I already subtracted.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that some triangles are the same due to symmetry, but the question is about distinct triangles, which usually means different sets of points, not considering rotations or reflections.Therefore, I think my calculation is correct: 48 triangles.But since the answer choices include 44, maybe I need to consider that in the grid, some sets of three points are colinear in a way I didn't consider.Wait, let me think about the diagonals again. Maybe there are three points that are colinear but not in the same row or column.For example, points (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). But in this grid, y only goes up to 1, so (2,2) doesn't exist. Similarly, points (0,1), (1,0), (2,-1) would go out of the grid.Alternatively, points (0,0), (2,1), (4,2), but again, x=4 is beyond the grid.Wait, but in a 2x4 grid, the maximum x is 3, and y is 1.So, any line with a slope that would pass through three points would have to stay within these bounds.Let me calculate the possible slopes.Suppose I have three points: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3).For them to be collinear, the slope between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) must be equal to the slope between (x2, y2) and (x3, y3).So, let's see if there are any such sets.Take point (0,0). What other points can form a line with it?If I take (1,1), the slope is (1-0)/(1-0) = 1. Then, the next point would be (2,2), which doesn't exist.If I take (2,1), the slope is (1-0)/(2-0) = 1/2. Then, the next point would be (4,2), which doesn't exist.If I take (3,1), the slope is (1-0)/(3-0) = 1/3. Then, the next point would be (6,2), which doesn't exist.Similarly, starting from (1,0):Slope to (2,1) is (1-0)/(2-1) = 1. Next point would be (3,2), which doesn't exist.Slope to (3,1) is (1-0)/(3-1) = 1/2. Next point would be (5,2), which doesn't exist.Starting from (2,0):Slope to (3,1) is (1-0)/(3-2) = 1. Next point would be (4,2), which doesn't exist.Similarly, starting from (0,1):Slope to (1,0) is (0-1)/(1-0) = -1. Next point would be (2,-1), which doesn't exist.Slope to (2,0) is (0-1)/(2-0) = -1/2. Next point would be (4,-1), which doesn't exist.Slope to (3,0) is (0-1)/(3-0) = -1/3. Next point would be (6,-1), which doesn't exist.Similarly, starting from (1,1):Slope to (2,0) is (0-1)/(2-1) = -1. Next point would be (3,-1), which doesn't exist.Slope to (3,0) is (0-1)/(3-1) = -1/2. Next point would be (5,-1), which doesn't exist.Starting from (2,1):Slope to (3,0) is (0-1)/(3-2) = -1. Next point would be (4,-1), which doesn't exist.So, in all these cases, there are no three points that are collinear except those in the same row.Therefore, my initial conclusion holds: only 8 collinear sets.Thus, the number of distinct triangles is 56 - 8 = 48.Therefore, the answer is D)48.But wait, the initial problem had answer choices up to 56, and 48 is an option, so I think that's correct.I think I confused myself earlier by thinking it was 44, but after carefully recounting, it's 48.So, the final answer is D)48."},{"question":"When x > 1, the inequality frac{x^2 + 3}{x - 1} > m^2 + 1 always holds. Determine the range of values for the real number m.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality: (x² + 3)/(x - 1) > m² + 1, and it's supposed to hold for all x > 1. I need to find the range of real numbers m that satisfy this condition. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if an inequality has to hold for all x in a certain range, it often means that the expression on one side has a minimum or maximum value within that range. In this case, since x > 1, the denominator x - 1 is positive, so the function (x² + 3)/(x - 1) is defined and positive as well.Maybe I should try to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = (x² + 3)/(x - 1) for x > 1. If I can find this minimum, then the inequality will hold if m² + 1 is less than this minimum. That makes sense because if m² + 1 is less than the smallest value that f(x) can take, then f(x) will always be greater than m² + 1.Alright, so how do I find the minimum of f(x)? I can use calculus. I'll take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. That should give me the critical points, and then I can determine which one gives the minimum value.Let's compute the derivative. Using the quotient rule: if f(x) = g(x)/h(x), then f'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x))/[h(x)]².Here, g(x) = x² + 3, so g'(x) = 2x. h(x) = x - 1, so h'(x) = 1.Plugging into the quotient rule:f'(x) = [2x*(x - 1) - (x² + 3)*1]/(x - 1)²Simplify the numerator:2x(x - 1) = 2x² - 2xSubtract (x² + 3):2x² - 2x - x² - 3 = x² - 2x - 3So f'(x) = (x² - 2x - 3)/(x - 1)²To find critical points, set f'(x) = 0:(x² - 2x - 3) = 0Solve the quadratic equation:x² - 2x - 3 = 0Using quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)]/2 = [2 ± 4]/2So x = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or x = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1But since x > 1, we discard x = -1. So the critical point is at x = 3.Now, to confirm if this is a minimum, I can check the second derivative or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative around x = 3.Alternatively, since the function f(x) tends to infinity as x approaches 1 from the right and as x approaches infinity, the critical point at x = 3 is likely to be a minimum.Let me compute f(3):f(3) = (3² + 3)/(3 - 1) = (9 + 3)/2 = 12/2 = 6So the minimum value of f(x) is 6 when x = 3.Therefore, for the inequality (x² + 3)/(x - 1) > m² + 1 to hold for all x > 1, we must have:6 > m² + 1Subtract 1 from both sides:5 > m²Which means:m² < 5Taking square roots:|m| < sqrt(5)So m must be between -sqrt(5) and sqrt(5).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found the derivative correctly using the quotient rule.2. Solved for critical points, got x = 3 and x = -1, but only x = 3 is in the domain x > 1.3. Evaluated f(3) correctly as 6.4. Set up the inequality 6 > m² + 1, leading to m² < 5.5. Therefore, m is in (-sqrt(5), sqrt(5)).Seems solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.Another way to approach this without calculus is by using algebraic manipulation. Maybe completing the square or using the AM-GM inequality?Let me try that. Let me rewrite the function f(x) = (x² + 3)/(x - 1).Let me set t = x - 1, so t > 0 since x > 1. Then x = t + 1.Substitute into f(x):f(x) = [(t + 1)² + 3]/t = (t² + 2t + 1 + 3)/t = (t² + 2t + 4)/t = t + 2 + 4/tSo f(x) = t + 4/t + 2, where t > 0.Now, I can think of this as f(t) = t + 4/t + 2. To find the minimum of this expression, I can use the AM-GM inequality.Recall that for positive numbers a and b, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean: (a + b)/2 ≥ sqrt(ab). Equality holds when a = b.Let me apply this to the terms t and 4/t.AM = (t + 4/t)/2 ≥ sqrt(t * 4/t) = sqrt(4) = 2Multiply both sides by 2:t + 4/t ≥ 4So f(t) = t + 4/t + 2 ≥ 4 + 2 = 6Thus, the minimum value of f(t) is 6, achieved when t = 4/t, which implies t² = 4, so t = 2 (since t > 0). Therefore, x = t + 1 = 3, which matches our earlier result.So regardless of the method, calculus or algebra, we find that the minimum value of f(x) is 6. Therefore, m² + 1 must be less than 6, leading to m² < 5, so m is between -sqrt(5) and sqrt(5).I think that's thorough. I considered two different methods to confirm the result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.**Final Answer**The range of values for the real number ( m ) is boxed{(-sqrt{5}, sqrt{5})}."},{"question":"The graph of the function y = sin(2x) - sqrt{3}cos(2x) can be obtained by shifting the graph of the function y = 2sin(2x) at least ______ units to the right.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many units to shift the graph of y = 2sin(2x) to the right to get the graph of y = sin(2x) - √3 cos(2x). Hmm, alright, let me try to work through this step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with sinusoidal functions like sine and cosine, you can often rewrite them in a different form to make it easier to see things like amplitude, period, and phase shifts. The general form for a sine function is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, where A is the amplitude, B affects the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, both functions don't have a vertical shift, so D is zero for both.Looking at the target function, y = sin(2x) - √3 cos(2x), I notice that it's a combination of sine and cosine terms with the same argument, 2x. I think I can rewrite this as a single sine function with a phase shift. I recall that there's an identity that allows you to express a combination of sine and cosine as a single sine function with a phase shift. The identity is something like A sinθ + B cosθ = C sin(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.Let me try to apply that here. So, for y = sin(2x) - √3 cos(2x), I can think of this as A sin(2x) + B cos(2x), where A = 1 and B = -√3. To rewrite this in the form C sin(2x + φ), I need to find C and φ such that:C sin(2x + φ) = C sin(2x) cosφ + C cos(2x) sinφ.Comparing this to the original expression, we have:A = C cosφ = 1,B = C sinφ = -√3.So, we have two equations:1. C cosφ = 1,2. C sinφ = -√3.To find C, I can use the Pythagorean identity, which says that (C cosφ)^2 + (C sinφ)^2 = C^2. Plugging in the values from the equations above:1^2 + (-√3)^2 = C^2,1 + 3 = C^2,4 = C^2,C = 2.Okay, so the amplitude C is 2. That makes sense because the original function y = 2sin(2x) has an amplitude of 2, so it's consistent.Now, I need to find the phase shift φ. From the first equation, C cosφ = 1, so cosφ = 1/C = 1/2. Similarly, from the second equation, C sinφ = -√3, so sinφ = -√3/2.Looking at the values of sine and cosine, cosφ = 1/2 and sinφ = -√3/2. I know that cos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(π/3) = √3/2. But since sinφ is negative here, φ must be in the fourth quadrant. The angle that has cosine 1/2 and sine -√3/2 is -π/3 or, equivalently, 5π/3. However, since we're dealing with phase shifts, it's more common to express it as a positive angle, so I'll use 5π/3. But wait, in terms of shifting the graph, a phase shift of 5π/3 would mean shifting it to the right by 5π/3 units, right? But that seems like a lot. Maybe I can express it as a negative shift? Let me think.Alternatively, since sinφ = -√3/2 and cosφ = 1/2, φ is in the fourth quadrant. The reference angle is π/3, so φ = -π/3. That makes sense because shifting by -π/3 would be equivalent to shifting to the right by π/3. Wait, no, actually, in the equation y = C sin(Bx + φ), a positive φ would shift the graph to the left, and a negative φ would shift it to the right. So, if φ is -π/3, that would mean shifting the graph to the right by π/3 units. Hmm, but earlier I thought of it as 5π/3, which is the same as -π/3 in terms of direction. So, maybe I should stick with φ = -π/3.But let me double-check. If I have y = 2 sin(2x - π/3), that would be equivalent to y = 2 sin[2(x - π/6)]. So, the phase shift is π/6 to the right. Wait, that's different from what I just thought. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.Let me go back. The general form is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, and the phase shift is -C/B. In this case, after rewriting, we have y = 2 sin(2x - π/3). So, comparing to y = A sin(Bx + C), C is -π/3. Therefore, the phase shift is -C/B = (π/3)/2 = π/6. So, the graph is shifted π/6 units to the right.Wait, so earlier I thought φ was -π/3, but when considering the phase shift formula, it's actually π/6. That makes more sense because the coefficient inside the sine function is 2, so the phase shift is divided by that coefficient.So, putting it all together, the original function y = sin(2x) - √3 cos(2x) can be rewritten as y = 2 sin(2x - π/3), which is equivalent to y = 2 sin[2(x - π/6)]. Therefore, the graph of y = 2 sin(2x) needs to be shifted π/6 units to the right to obtain the graph of y = sin(2x) - √3 cos(2x).Let me just verify this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I take y = 2 sin(2x) and shift it π/6 to the right, I get y = 2 sin[2(x - π/6)] = 2 sin(2x - π/3). Expanding this using the sine subtraction formula:2 sin(2x - π/3) = 2 [sin(2x) cos(π/3) - cos(2x) sin(π/3)].We know that cos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(π/3) = √3/2, so plugging those in:2 [sin(2x)(1/2) - cos(2x)(√3/2)] = 2*(1/2 sin(2x) - √3/2 cos(2x)) = sin(2x) - √3 cos(2x).Yes, that matches the original function. So, the phase shift is indeed π/6 units to the right.I think I've got it now. The key was to rewrite the given function in the form of a single sine function with a phase shift and then use the phase shift formula to determine how much to shift the original graph."},{"question":"Simplify the expression:[frac{x^{3 / p} - x^{3 / q}}{left(x^{1 / p} + x^{1 / q}right)^{2} - 2 x^{1 / q} left(x^{1 / q} + x^{1 / p}right)} + frac{x^{1 / p}}{x^{(q-p) / p q} + 1}.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this expression to simplify:[frac{x^{3 / p} - x^{3 / q}}{left(x^{1 / p} + x^{1 / q}right)^{2} - 2 x^{1 / q} left(x^{1 / q} + x^{1 / p}right)} + frac{x^{1 / p}}{x^{(q-p) / p q} + 1}.]Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's take it step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the expression and see if I can simplify them separately before combining them.Starting with the first term:[frac{x^{3 / p} - x^{3 / q}}{left(x^{1 / p} + x^{1 / q}right)^{2} - 2 x^{1 / q} left(x^{1 / q} + x^{1 / p}right)}.]I notice that both the numerator and the denominator involve exponents of x with fractions p and q. Maybe I can factor the numerator or simplify the denominator somehow.Looking at the numerator, (x^{3/p} - x^{3/q}), that reminds me of the difference of cubes formula. The difference of cubes is (a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)). So, if I let (a = x^{1/p}) and (b = x^{1/q}), then the numerator becomes:[(x^{1/p} - x^{1/q})(x^{2/p} + x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q}).]Okay, so that's the numerator factored. Now, let's look at the denominator:[left(x^{1 / p} + x^{1 / q}right)^{2} - 2 x^{1 / q} left(x^{1 / q} + x^{1 / p}right).]I can expand the first term:[left(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}right)^2 = x^{2/p} + 2x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q}.]Now, the second term in the denominator is:[2x^{1/q}(x^{1/q} + x^{1/p}) = 2x^{2/q} + 2x^{1/p}x^{1/q}.]So, subtracting this from the expanded square:[x^{2/p} + 2x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q} - (2x^{2/q} + 2x^{1/p}x^{1/q}) = x^{2/p} - x^{2/q}.]Ah, that simplifies nicely. So the denominator becomes (x^{2/p} - x^{2/q}). I can factor this as a difference of squares:[x^{2/p} - x^{2/q} = (x^{1/p} - x^{1/q})(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}).]Now, putting the numerator and denominator together:[frac{(x^{1/p} - x^{1/q})(x^{2/p} + x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q})}{(x^{1/p} - x^{1/q})(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q})}.]I see that (x^{1/p} - x^{1/q}) cancels out from both the numerator and the denominator, leaving me with:[frac{x^{2/p} + x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]Hmm, maybe I can factor this further or simplify it more. Let me see if the numerator can be expressed in terms of the denominator. The numerator is:[x^{2/p} + x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q}.]And the denominator is:[x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}.]I wonder if the numerator is a multiple of the denominator. Let me try to divide the numerator by the denominator:[frac{x^{2/p} + x^{1/p}x^{1/q} + x^{2/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]If I let (a = x^{1/p}) and (b = x^{1/q}), then the numerator becomes (a^2 + ab + b^2) and the denominator becomes (a + b). I know that (a^2 + ab + b^2) doesn't factor nicely with (a + b), but maybe I can perform polynomial division or see if it's a perfect square.Wait, (a^2 + ab + b^2) is actually the expansion of ((a + b)^2 - ab). Let me check:[(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.]So, (a^2 + ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - ab). Therefore, the numerator can be written as:[(a + b)^2 - ab = (x^{1/p} + x^{1/q})^2 - x^{1/p}x^{1/q}.]So, substituting back into the fraction:[frac{(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q})^2 - x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]I can split this fraction into two parts:[frac{(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q})^2}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}} - frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]Simplifying the first term:[frac{(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q})^2}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}} = x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}.]So now, the expression becomes:[x^{1/p} + x^{1/q} - frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]Hmm, that's interesting. Now, let's look at the second term in the original expression:[frac{x^{1 / p}}{x^{(q-p) / p q} + 1}.]I need to simplify this as well. Let's focus on the exponent in the denominator:[x^{(q - p)/pq}.]I can rewrite this exponent as:[x^{(q - p)/pq} = x^{q/(pq) - p/(pq)} = x^{1/p - 1/q} = frac{x^{1/p}}{x^{1/q}}.]So, substituting back into the denominator:[x^{(q - p)/pq} + 1 = frac{x^{1/p}}{x^{1/q}} + 1 = frac{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}{x^{1/q}}.]Therefore, the second term becomes:[frac{x^{1/p}}{frac{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}{x^{1/q}}} = frac{x^{1/p} cdot x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}} = frac{x^{1/p + 1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]Wait, (x^{1/p + 1/q}) is the same as (x^{(q + p)/pq}), but I don't think that's necessary here. So, the second term simplifies to:[frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]Now, going back to the first part of the expression, which we had simplified to:[x^{1/p} + x^{1/q} - frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]So, combining both parts of the original expression:[left(x^{1/p} + x^{1/q} - frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}right) + frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}.]I notice that the (- frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}) and (+ frac{x^{1/p}x^{1/q}}{x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}}) terms cancel each other out. So, what's left is just:[x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}.]Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:[x^{1/p} + x^{1/q}.]Which can also be written as:[sqrt[p]{x} + sqrt[q]{x}.]So, after simplifying both terms and combining them, the result is the sum of the p-th root of x and the q-th root of x.**Final Answer**The simplified expression is boxed{sqrt[p]{x} + sqrt[q]{x}}."},{"question":"Given that x and y are positive real numbers satisfying the equation xy = x + 2y + 6, find the minimum value of frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y} ( ).A: frac{1}{2}B: frac{1}{4}C: frac{1}{3}D: frac{1}{6}","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}) given that (x) and (y) are positive real numbers satisfying the equation (xy = x + 2y + 6). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I should probably write down the given equation and see if I can manipulate it to express one variable in terms of the other. The equation is (xy = x + 2y + 6). Maybe I can rearrange this to solve for (x) or (y). Let me try solving for (x).Starting with (xy = x + 2y + 6), I can subtract (x) from both sides to get (xy - x = 2y + 6). Then, factor out (x) on the left side: (x(y - 1) = 2y + 6). Now, solving for (x), I get (x = frac{2y + 6}{y - 1}). Okay, so (x) is expressed in terms of (y). Since (x) and (y) are positive, the denominator (y - 1) must be positive as well, right? Otherwise, (x) would be negative if (y - 1) is negative, which isn't allowed. So that means (y - 1 > 0), which implies (y > 1).Alright, so (y) has to be greater than 1. Now, I need to find the minimum value of (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}). Since I have (x) expressed in terms of (y), maybe I can substitute that expression into the expression I need to minimize.So, substituting (x = frac{2y + 6}{y - 1}) into (frac{1}{x}), I get (frac{1}{x} = frac{y - 1}{2y + 6}). Therefore, the expression becomes:[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y} = frac{y - 1}{2y + 6} + frac{1}{2y}]Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can combine these two fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (2y + 6) and (2y). Let me factor out a 2 from the first denominator: (2y + 6 = 2(y + 3)). So, the denominators are (2(y + 3)) and (2y). The least common denominator (LCD) would be (2y(y + 3)).So, rewriting both fractions with the LCD:[frac{y - 1}{2(y + 3)} = frac{(y - 1)y}{2y(y + 3)} = frac{y^2 - y}{2y(y + 3)}][frac{1}{2y} = frac{(y + 3)}{2y(y + 3)} = frac{y + 3}{2y(y + 3)}]Now, adding them together:[frac{y^2 - y + y + 3}{2y(y + 3)} = frac{y^2 + 3}{2y(y + 3)}]Wait, that simplifies nicely. The numerator is (y^2 + 3) and the denominator is (2y(y + 3)). So, the expression we're trying to minimize is:[frac{y^2 + 3}{2y(y + 3)}]Hmm, maybe I can simplify this further or find a way to apply some inequality here. Let me see. Since we're dealing with positive real numbers, perhaps the AM-GM inequality can be useful here. But I need to see if I can express this in a form where AM-GM can be applied.Alternatively, maybe I can perform some substitution or manipulate the expression to make it easier to handle. Let me try to write the expression as:[frac{y^2 + 3}{2y(y + 3)} = frac{y^2 + 3}{2y^2 + 6y}]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can split the fraction:[frac{y^2}{2y^2 + 6y} + frac{3}{2y^2 + 6y} = frac{1}{2 + 6/y} + frac{3}{2y^2 + 6y}]Not sure if that's helpful either. Maybe another approach. Let's consider the original equation (xy = x + 2y + 6) again. Maybe instead of solving for (x), I can solve for (y) in terms of (x). Let me try that.Starting with (xy = x + 2y + 6), subtract (2y) from both sides: (xy - 2y = x + 6). Factor out (y) on the left: (y(x - 2) = x + 6). So, (y = frac{x + 6}{x - 2}). Since (y) must be positive, the denominator (x - 2) must be positive, so (x > 2).Now, substituting (y = frac{x + 6}{x - 2}) into the expression (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}):[frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2 cdot frac{x + 6}{x - 2}} = frac{1}{x} + frac{x - 2}{2(x + 6)}]Again, combining these two terms. Let me find a common denominator here as well. The denominators are (x) and (2(x + 6)). The LCD is (2x(x + 6)).So, rewriting both fractions:[frac{1}{x} = frac{2(x + 6)}{2x(x + 6)} = frac{2x + 12}{2x(x + 6)}][frac{x - 2}{2(x + 6)} = frac{(x - 2)x}{2x(x + 6)} = frac{x^2 - 2x}{2x(x + 6)}]Adding them together:[frac{2x + 12 + x^2 - 2x}{2x(x + 6)} = frac{x^2 + 12}{2x(x + 6)}]So, the expression simplifies to (frac{x^2 + 12}{2x(x + 6)}). Hmm, similar structure to the previous expression when I solved for (y). Maybe I can analyze this function to find its minimum.Let me denote (f(x) = frac{x^2 + 12}{2x(x + 6)}). To find its minimum, I can take the derivative and set it equal to zero. Let's compute (f'(x)).First, write (f(x)) as:[f(x) = frac{x^2 + 12}{2x^2 + 12x}]Let me compute the derivative using the quotient rule. If (f(x) = frac{u}{v}), then (f'(x) = frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}).Here, (u = x^2 + 12), so (u' = 2x).(v = 2x^2 + 12x), so (v' = 4x + 12).Therefore,[f'(x) = frac{(2x)(2x^2 + 12x) - (x^2 + 12)(4x + 12)}{(2x^2 + 12x)^2}]Let me compute the numerator:First term: (2x(2x^2 + 12x) = 4x^3 + 24x^2)Second term: ((x^2 + 12)(4x + 12)). Let's expand this:Multiply (x^2) by (4x + 12): (4x^3 + 12x^2)Multiply 12 by (4x + 12): (48x + 144)So, altogether: (4x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 144)Now, subtract the second term from the first term:Numerator = (4x^3 + 24x^2 - (4x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 144))Simplify:(4x^3 + 24x^2 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 - 48x - 144)Combine like terms:( (4x^3 - 4x^3) + (24x^2 - 12x^2) + (-48x) + (-144) )Which simplifies to:(0 + 12x^2 - 48x - 144)Factor out 12:(12(x^2 - 4x - 12))So, the numerator is (12(x^2 - 4x - 12)), and the denominator is ((2x^2 + 12x)^2). Therefore,[f'(x) = frac{12(x^2 - 4x - 12)}{(2x^2 + 12x)^2}]To find critical points, set the numerator equal to zero:(12(x^2 - 4x - 12) = 0)Divide both sides by 12:(x^2 - 4x - 12 = 0)Solve for (x) using quadratic formula:(x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 48}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{64}}{2} = frac{4 pm 8}{2})So, (x = frac{4 + 8}{2} = 6) or (x = frac{4 - 8}{2} = -2)But since (x > 2), we discard (x = -2). So, the critical point is at (x = 6).Now, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum. We can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign of the first derivative around (x = 6).Let me check the sign of (f'(x)) around (x = 6). Pick a value less than 6, say (x = 5):Compute numerator: (x^2 - 4x - 12 = 25 - 20 - 12 = -7), so numerator is negative. Denominator is always positive since it's squared. Therefore, (f'(5) < 0).Pick a value greater than 6, say (x = 7):Numerator: (49 - 28 - 12 = 9), positive. So, (f'(7) > 0).Therefore, the function is decreasing before (x = 6) and increasing after (x = 6), which means (x = 6) is a local minimum. Since the function tends to infinity as (x) approaches 2 from the right and as (x) approaches infinity, this local minimum is indeed the global minimum.So, the minimum occurs at (x = 6). Now, let's find the corresponding (y) value.From earlier, (y = frac{x + 6}{x - 2}). Plugging in (x = 6):[y = frac{6 + 6}{6 - 2} = frac{12}{4} = 3]So, (y = 3). Now, compute (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}):[frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{2 cdot 3} = frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{6} = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3}]Therefore, the minimum value is (frac{1}{3}).Wait, let me just verify to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, if (x = 6) and (y = 3), plugging back into the original equation:(xy = 6 cdot 3 = 18)(x + 2y + 6 = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18)Yes, that checks out. So, the values satisfy the original equation. And the expression (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}) indeed equals (frac{1}{3}).I think that's solid. So, the minimum value is (frac{1}{3}), which corresponds to option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given 95 numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{95}, each of which can only take one of two values, +1 or -1, then the sum of the products of them taken two at a time, a_1a_2 + a_1a_3 + ldots + a_{94}a_{95}, has a minimum positive value of ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 95 numbers, each can be either +1 or -1. I need to find the minimum positive value of the sum of the products of these numbers taken two at a time. That is, I need to compute ( S = a_1a_2 + a_1a_3 + ldots + a_{94}a_{95} ) and find its minimum positive value.First, let me try to understand what this sum represents. It's the sum of all possible products of two different numbers from the set. Since each ( a_i ) is either +1 or -1, each product ( a_ia_j ) will also be either +1 or -1. So, the sum S is essentially counting how many times +1 appears minus how many times -1 appears in all these products.But that might not be the easiest way to approach it. Maybe there's a formula or identity that can help simplify this expression. I remember that the square of the sum of the numbers can be related to the sum of their squares and twice the sum of their products. Let me write that down:[ left( sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i right)^2 = sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 95} a_ia_j ]Yes, that looks right. So, if I let ( T = sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i ), then the equation becomes:[ T^2 = sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2S ]Since each ( a_i ) is either +1 or -1, ( a_i^2 = 1 ) for all i. Therefore, the sum of the squares is just 95:[ T^2 = 95 + 2S ]So, solving for S:[ 2S = T^2 - 95 ][ S = frac{T^2 - 95}{2} ]Okay, so S is expressed in terms of T, which is the sum of all the numbers. Since each ( a_i ) is either +1 or -1, T must be an odd integer because 95 is odd, and the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd. So, T can be any odd integer from -95 to +95.But we need to find the minimum positive value of S. So, S must be positive, which means ( T^2 - 95 > 0 ), so ( T^2 > 95 ). Therefore, |T| must be greater than ( sqrt{95} ). Calculating that, ( sqrt{95} ) is approximately 9.746. So, |T| must be at least 11 because the next odd integer after 9 is 11.Wait, hold on. Let me check that. If T is 9, then ( T^2 = 81 ), which is less than 95, so S would be negative. If T is 11, ( T^2 = 121 ), which is greater than 95, so S would be positive. So, the smallest |T| that makes S positive is 11.But hold on, is 11 the smallest possible |T| that is greater than ( sqrt{95} )? Let me verify:- ( T = 9 ): ( 9^2 = 81 ), which gives ( S = (81 - 95)/2 = (-14)/2 = -7 ) (negative)- ( T = 11 ): ( 11^2 = 121 ), which gives ( S = (121 - 95)/2 = 26/2 = 13 ) (positive)- ( T = -11 ): same as T=11, because squaring removes the negative.So, the smallest |T| that gives a positive S is 11, leading to S=13. Is this the minimum positive value? It seems so because if we go to the next odd integer, T=13, then ( T^2 = 169 ), which gives ( S = (169 - 95)/2 = 74/2 = 37 ), which is larger than 13. Similarly, T=15 would give an even larger S.But wait, is there a way to get a smaller positive S? Maybe with a different approach. Let me think again.We have S expressed as ( S = frac{T^2 - 95}{2} ). So, to minimize S, we need to minimize ( T^2 ) such that ( T^2 > 95 ). The smallest integer T where ( T^2 > 95 ) is 10, but T must be odd, so the next odd integer is 11. Therefore, 11 is indeed the smallest |T| that gives a positive S.But wait, is T allowed to be 10? No, because T is the sum of 95 numbers each of which is ±1. So, T must be odd because 95 is odd. Therefore, T cannot be even. So, the next possible T after 9 is 11, which is the smallest odd integer greater than ( sqrt{95} approx 9.746 ).Therefore, the minimum positive value of S is 13.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that such a configuration is possible. That is, can we actually have T=11 with 95 numbers of ±1?Yes, because T is the sum of the numbers, which is equal to 2m - 95, where m is the number of +1s. So, setting T=11:[ 2m - 95 = 11 ][ 2m = 106 ][ m = 53 ]So, if we have 53 numbers of +1 and 42 numbers of -1, the sum T would be 11, and then S would be 13. Similarly, if we have 42 numbers of +1 and 53 numbers of -1, T would be -11, but since we square it, S would still be 13.Therefore, it's possible to achieve S=13, and since any smaller |T| would result in a negative S, 13 is indeed the minimum positive value.So, after going through this step-by-step, I'm confident that the minimum positive value of the sum S is 13.**Final Answer**The minimum positive value is boxed{13}."},{"question":"The coefficient of the term with the highest coefficient in the expansion of (x-y)^9 is (　　)  A: 84  B: 126  C: 210  D: 252","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the coefficient of the term with the highest coefficient in the expansion of (x - y)^9. The options are A: 84, B: 126, C: 210, D: 252. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.First, I remember that when expanding a binomial like (x + y)^n, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that (x + y)^n = Σ (from k=0 to n) [C(n, k) * x^(n - k) * y^k], where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. But in this case, it's (x - y)^9, so there's a negative sign involved. That means each term will have a factor of (-1)^k, right? So, the expansion will alternate signs depending on the value of k.Now, the question is about the term with the highest coefficient. So, I need to figure out which term in the expansion has the largest coefficient. Since the coefficients are C(9, k) multiplied by (-1)^k, the actual coefficients will alternate between positive and negative. However, the magnitude of the coefficients depends only on C(9, k). So, the term with the highest coefficient in terms of magnitude will be the one where C(9, k) is the largest.Wait, but the question specifically says \\"the coefficient of the term with the highest coefficient.\\" So, does that mean the largest in magnitude or the largest positive coefficient? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. But looking at the options, they are all positive numbers, so I think they're referring to the largest positive coefficient.But let me think again. If we consider the coefficients as they are, including the sign, then the largest coefficient could be positive or negative. But since all the options are positive, maybe they just want the largest magnitude. Hmm, but the question is a bit unclear. Maybe I should consider both interpretations.But let's proceed step by step. First, let's recall that in the expansion of (x + y)^n, the coefficients are symmetric. That is, C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So, for n = 9, the coefficients will be symmetric around k = 4.5. Since k has to be an integer, the middle terms will be at k = 4 and k = 5. So, C(9, 4) and C(9, 5) should be equal because of the symmetry.Wait, let me compute C(9, 4) and C(9, 5). C(9, 4) is 126, and C(9, 5) is also 126. So, both these terms have the same coefficient magnitude. But in our case, since it's (x - y)^9, the signs will alternate. So, the term at k = 4 will be positive because (-1)^4 = 1, and the term at k = 5 will be negative because (-1)^5 = -1. So, the coefficient at k = 4 is +126, and at k = 5 is -126.So, if we're looking for the highest coefficient, considering the sign, the highest positive coefficient is 126, and the lowest coefficient is -126. But the question is about the coefficient of the term with the highest coefficient. So, if we take \\"highest\\" as the largest in value, regardless of sign, then 126 is the highest. But if we take \\"highest\\" as the most positive, then 126 is still the highest. So, in either case, 126 is the answer.But wait, let me double-check. Let's list out all the coefficients for k from 0 to 9.For k = 0: C(9, 0) * (-1)^0 = 1 * 1 = 1k = 1: C(9, 1) * (-1)^1 = 9 * (-1) = -9k = 2: C(9, 2) * (-1)^2 = 36 * 1 = 36k = 3: C(9, 3) * (-1)^3 = 84 * (-1) = -84k = 4: C(9, 4) * (-1)^4 = 126 * 1 = 126k = 5: C(9, 5) * (-1)^5 = 126 * (-1) = -126k = 6: C(9, 6) * (-1)^6 = 84 * 1 = 84k = 7: C(9, 7) * (-1)^7 = 36 * (-1) = -36k = 8: C(9, 8) * (-1)^8 = 9 * 1 = 9k = 9: C(9, 9) * (-1)^9 = 1 * (-1) = -1So, listing all the coefficients: 1, -9, 36, -84, 126, -126, 84, -36, 9, -1.Looking at these, the largest positive coefficient is 126, and the largest in magnitude is also 126. So, regardless of interpretation, 126 is the highest coefficient. Therefore, the answer should be B: 126.But wait, just to make sure, is there any term with a higher coefficient? Let's see. The coefficients increase up to k = 4 and then decrease after k = 5. So, the maximum occurs at k = 4 and k = 5, but with opposite signs. So, the highest positive coefficient is at k = 4, which is 126.Therefore, I think the correct answer is B: 126."},{"question":"If the function f(x) = 3sin(x + frac{π}{10}) - 2 is a monotonic function on the interval [frac{π}{2}, a], then the maximum value of the real number a is _____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) = 3 sin(x + π/10) - 2 is a monotonic function on the interval [π/2, a]. I need to find the maximum value of the real number a. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that a function is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing over an interval. For sine functions, which are periodic, their monotonicity depends on the interval we're looking at. The sine function increases from -π/2 to π/2 and decreases from π/2 to 3π/2, and this pattern repeats every 2π.So, in this case, the function is f(x) = 3 sin(x + π/10) - 2. Let me rewrite it to make it a bit clearer: f(x) = 3 sin(x + π/10) - 2. The amplitude is 3, and the vertical shift is -2, but those don't affect the monotonicity; they just change the range of the function. The key part here is the argument of the sine function, which is x + π/10. To analyze the monotonicity, I should consider the derivative of f(x). The derivative f’(x) will tell me where the function is increasing or decreasing. Let me compute that:f’(x) = d/dx [3 sin(x + π/10) - 2] = 3 cos(x + π/10).So, f’(x) = 3 cos(x + π/10). Since 3 is a positive constant, the sign of f’(x) depends on cos(x + π/10). Therefore, f(x) is increasing when cos(x + π/10) > 0 and decreasing when cos(x + π/10) < 0.Now, the function f(x) is monotonic on [π/2, a] if f’(x) does not change sign on that interval. That means either cos(x + π/10) is always positive or always negative on [π/2, a]. Let me figure out where cos(x + π/10) changes sign. Cosine is positive in the intervals (-π/2 + 2πk, π/2 + 2πk) and negative in (π/2 + 2πk, 3π/2 + 2πk) for any integer k. So, cos(x + π/10) = 0 when x + π/10 = π/2 + πk, which simplifies to x = π/2 - π/10 + πk = (5π/10 - π/10) + πk = (4π/10) + πk = (2π/5) + πk.Therefore, the critical points where the derivative is zero are at x = 2π/5 + πk for any integer k. These are the points where the function f(x) changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.Now, our interval starts at x = π/2. Let me compute what x + π/10 is at x = π/2:x + π/10 = π/2 + π/10 = (5π/10 + π/10) = 6π/10 = 3π/5.So, at x = π/2, the argument of the sine function is 3π/5. Now, 3π/5 is approximately 1.885 radians, which is between π/2 (~1.571) and π (~3.142). So, at x = π/2, we're just past the peak of the sine function.Since the derivative f’(x) = 3 cos(x + π/10), and at x = π/2, x + π/10 = 3π/5, which is in the second quadrant where cosine is negative. Therefore, f’(x) is negative at x = π/2, meaning the function is decreasing at that point.For f(x) to remain monotonic on [π/2, a], it must continue to decrease throughout the interval. That means we need to ensure that the derivative doesn't become positive again in this interval. The next critical point where the derivative is zero is when x + π/10 = 3π/2, which is the next point where cosine is zero and changes sign.So, solving for x when x + π/10 = 3π/2:x = 3π/2 - π/10 = (15π/10 - π/10) = 14π/10 = 7π/5.Therefore, at x = 7π/5, the derivative f’(x) is zero, and beyond this point, the cosine becomes positive again, meaning the function would start increasing. So, to maintain monotonicity (specifically, decreasing in this case), the interval [π/2, a] must end before x = 7π/5.Hence, the maximum value of a is 7π/5. If a were any larger, the function would start increasing after x = 7π/5, which would mean it's no longer monotonic on the interval [π/2, a].Let me just double-check my reasoning. Starting at x = π/2, the function is decreasing because the derivative is negative. The next point where the derivative is zero is at x = 7π/5, so as long as a is less than or equal to 7π/5, the function remains decreasing. If a exceeds 7π/5, the function would start increasing, which would break the monotonicity. So, yes, 7π/5 is indeed the maximum value of a.I think that makes sense. So, the maximum value of a is 7π/5.**Final Answer**The maximum value of the real number ( a ) is (boxed{dfrac{7pi}{5}})."},{"question":"Georgina owns a parrot and is teaching it to speak.

If not, explain why;  (2) If the function f(x) is monotonic on mathbb{R}, find the range of values for a.","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) which is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = (1/3)a x³ + (1/2)(a + 1)x² - (a + 2)x + 6where a is a real number. There are two parts to this problem. First, part (1) says that if f(x) has a maximum value at x = -3, does it have a minimum value? If it does, find the minimum value; if not, explain why. Okay, so I remember that for a function to have a maximum or minimum, it needs to have critical points where the derivative is zero. Since f(x) is a cubic, its derivative will be a quadratic, which can have at most two real roots. So, if there's a maximum at x = -3, there should be another critical point, which could be a minimum. Let me start by finding the derivative of f(x). f'(x) = d/dx [ (1/3)a x³ + (1/2)(a + 1)x² - (a + 2)x + 6 ]Calculating term by term:- The derivative of (1/3)a x³ is a x².- The derivative of (1/2)(a + 1)x² is (a + 1)x.- The derivative of - (a + 2)x is - (a + 2).- The derivative of 6 is 0.So, putting it all together:f'(x) = a x² + (a + 1)x - (a + 2)Now, since f(x) has a maximum at x = -3, that means f'(-3) = 0. Let's plug x = -3 into f'(x):f'(-3) = a (-3)² + (a + 1)(-3) - (a + 2) = 0Calculating each term:- a (-3)² = 9a- (a + 1)(-3) = -3a - 3- - (a + 2) = -a - 2So, adding them up:9a - 3a - 3 - a - 2 = 0Combine like terms:(9a - 3a - a) + (-3 - 2) = 0That simplifies to:5a - 5 = 0So, 5a = 5 => a = 1Alright, so a is 1. Now, let's substitute a = 1 back into f'(x):f'(x) = (1)x² + (1 + 1)x - (1 + 2) = x² + 2x - 3Now, to find the critical points, set f'(x) = 0:x² + 2x - 3 = 0This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve for x:Using quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2aHere, a = 1, b = 2, c = -3Discriminant D = 4 + 12 = 16So, x = [-2 ± 4]/2Thus, x = (-2 + 4)/2 = 1 and x = (-2 - 4)/2 = -3So, the critical points are at x = -3 and x = 1. We already knew x = -3 is a maximum. To determine if x = 1 is a minimum, we can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of f'(x).Let me compute the second derivative f''(x):f''(x) = derivative of f'(x) = 2x + 2At x = -3:f''(-3) = 2*(-3) + 2 = -6 + 2 = -4 < 0, so concave down, which means it's a local maximum.At x = 1:f''(1) = 2*1 + 2 = 4 > 0, so concave up, which means it's a local minimum.Therefore, f(x) does have a minimum at x = 1. Now, let's find the value of f(1).Substitute a = 1 and x = 1 into f(x):f(1) = (1/3)(1)(1)³ + (1/2)(1 + 1)(1)² - (1 + 2)(1) + 6Compute each term:- (1/3)(1)(1) = 1/3- (1/2)(2)(1) = 1- -3(1) = -3- +6Adding them up:1/3 + 1 - 3 + 6 = (1/3 + 1) + (-3 + 6) = (4/3) + 3 = 4/3 + 9/3 = 13/3So, the minimum value is 13/3.Moving on to part (2): If the function f(x) is monotonic on ℝ, find the range of values for a.A function is monotonic if it is entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. For differentiable functions, this means the derivative does not change sign; that is, f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x or f'(x) ≤ 0 for all x.We already found f'(x) = a x² + (a + 1)x - (a + 2)So, f'(x) is a quadratic function. For f'(x) to not change sign, the quadratic must either be always non-negative or always non-positive. But since the leading coefficient is 'a', the behavior at infinity depends on 'a'. If a > 0, the parabola opens upwards; if a < 0, it opens downwards. If a = 0, f'(x) becomes linear.First, let's consider a ≠ 0. For the quadratic to not change sign, it must either have no real roots or exactly one real root (a double root). So, the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.The discriminant D of f'(x) is:D = (a + 1)² - 4 * a * (- (a + 2)) Let me compute that:D = (a² + 2a + 1) - 4a(-a - 2) = a² + 2a + 1 + 4a² + 8aCombine like terms:( a² + 4a² ) + (2a + 8a ) + 1 = 5a² + 10a + 1So, D = 5a² + 10a + 1For the quadratic to have at most one real root, D ≤ 0.So, 5a² + 10a + 1 ≤ 0Let's solve this inequality.First, find the roots of 5a² + 10a + 1 = 0Using quadratic formula:a = [-10 ± sqrt(100 - 20)] / 10 = [-10 ± sqrt(80)] / 10 = [-10 ± 4*sqrt(5)] / 10 = [-5 ± 2*sqrt(5)] / 5So, the roots are a = (-5 + 2√5)/5 and a = (-5 - 2√5)/5Since the coefficient of a² is positive (5), the quadratic opens upwards. Therefore, 5a² + 10a + 1 ≤ 0 between the two roots.Thus, the solution is:(-5 - 2√5)/5 ≤ a ≤ (-5 + 2√5)/5But we also need to consider the case when a = 0. If a = 0, f'(x) becomes:f'(x) = 0*x² + (0 + 1)x - (0 + 2) = x - 2This is a linear function with a slope of 1, which is positive. However, it crosses the x-axis at x = 2, meaning f'(x) changes sign from negative to positive. Therefore, f(x) is not monotonic on ℝ when a = 0.So, a cannot be zero. Therefore, the range of a is:(-5 - 2√5)/5 ≤ a ≤ (-5 + 2√5)/5But wait, let me double-check. When a is in this interval, the discriminant is ≤ 0, so f'(x) doesn't cross the x-axis, so it's either always non-negative or always non-positive.But depending on the leading coefficient 'a', we need to ensure that f'(x) is either always non-negative or non-positive.If a > 0, the parabola opens upwards. If D ≤ 0, it doesn't cross the x-axis, so f'(x) ≥ 0 for all x.If a < 0, the parabola opens downwards. If D ≤ 0, it doesn't cross the x-axis, so f'(x) ≤ 0 for all x.But in our case, the interval (-5 - 2√5)/5 to (-5 + 2√5)/5 includes both positive and negative a?Wait, let's compute the numerical values:Compute (-5 + 2√5)/5:√5 ≈ 2.236, so 2√5 ≈ 4.472So, (-5 + 4.472)/5 ≈ (-0.528)/5 ≈ -0.1056Similarly, (-5 - 2√5)/5 ≈ (-5 - 4.472)/5 ≈ (-9.472)/5 ≈ -1.8944So, the interval is approximately from -1.8944 to -0.1056. So, all a in this interval are negative.Therefore, when a is in this interval, since a < 0, the parabola opens downward, and since D ≤ 0, it doesn't cross the x-axis, so f'(x) ≤ 0 for all x. Therefore, f(x) is non-increasing on ℝ.Hence, the range of a is (-5 - 2√5)/5 ≤ a ≤ (-5 + 2√5)/5.But wait, earlier I thought a could be positive or negative, but in reality, the interval is entirely negative. So, f'(x) is always non-positive, hence f(x) is non-increasing.Therefore, the range is as above.**Final Answer**(1) The minimum value exists and is boxed{dfrac{13}{3}}.(2) The range of values for ( a ) is boxed{dfrac{-5 - 2sqrt{5}}{5} leq a leq dfrac{-5 + 2sqrt{5}}{5}}."},{"question":"The equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola x^{2}-2y^{2}=1 is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the equations of the asymptotes for the hyperbola given by the equation ( x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 ). Hmm, I remember that asymptotes are lines that the hyperbola approaches but never touches as it goes to infinity. They help in understanding the behavior of the hyperbola.First, I think I should recall the standard form of a hyperbola. I believe the standard form for a hyperbola that opens left and right (along the x-axis) is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ). Comparing this with the given equation ( x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 ), I can see that it's similar but not exactly in the standard form because the coefficients of ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) aren't both 1. So, to convert the given equation into the standard form, I need to divide both sides by 1 to make the coefficient of ( x^2 ) equal to 1. Wait, actually, the equation is already ( x^2 ) over 1 minus ( 2y^2 ) over 1 equals 1. But in the standard form, the denominators are ( a^2 ) and ( b^2 ). So, I can rewrite the equation as:( frac{x^2}{1} - frac{y^2}{frac{1}{2}} = 1 )Yes, that makes sense because ( 2y^2 ) is the same as ( frac{y^2}{frac{1}{2}} ). So now, ( a^2 = 1 ) and ( b^2 = frac{1}{2} ). Therefore, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ).Now, I remember that the equations of the asymptotes for a hyperbola in the form ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ) are given by ( y = pm frac{b}{a}x ). So, substituting the values of ( a ) and ( b ) that I found:( y = pm frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{1}x )Simplifying this, I get:( y = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x )Wait, let me double-check that. If ( b = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) and ( a = 1 ), then ( frac{b}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). So, yes, the slopes of the asymptotes are ( pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). Therefore, the equations of the asymptotes should be ( y = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x ).Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, I'll go through the steps again. The original equation is ( x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 ). Dividing both terms by 1 to get it into standard form, I have ( frac{x^2}{1} - frac{y^2}{frac{1}{2}} = 1 ). So, ( a^2 = 1 ) and ( b^2 = frac{1}{2} ), which means ( a = 1 ) and ( b = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). The asymptotes are ( y = pm frac{b}{a}x ), which is ( y = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x ). That seems consistent.I think I got it right. The asymptotes are straight lines passing through the origin with slopes ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) and ( -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). So, the equations are ( y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x ) and ( y = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x ).Just to visualize, if I were to graph this hyperbola, it would open to the left and right, and these asymptotes would be the lines that the hyperbola approaches as ( x ) becomes very large in the positive or negative direction. The slopes being ( pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) mean that the lines are relatively flat, not too steep.I wonder if there's another way to derive the asymptotes. Maybe by considering the behavior of the hyperbola as ( x ) and ( y ) become very large. If I let ( x ) and ( y ) approach infinity, the constant term 1 in the equation ( x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 ) becomes negligible compared to the ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ) terms. So, for very large ( x ) and ( y ), the equation approximately becomes ( x^2 - 2y^2 = 0 ), which can be factored as ( (x - sqrt{2}y)(x + sqrt{2}y) = 0 ). Therefore, the asymptotes are ( x - sqrt{2}y = 0 ) and ( x + sqrt{2}y = 0 ), which simplifies to ( y = frac{x}{sqrt{2}} ) and ( y = -frac{x}{sqrt{2}} ). Wait a minute, ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) is equal to ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), right? Because ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} times frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). So, yes, both methods give the same result. That makes me more confident that the asymptotes are indeed ( y = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x ).I think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work. It seems consistent, so I can conclude that the equations of the asymptotes are ( y = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x )."},{"question":"John and Steve are speed walkers in a race. John is 15 meters behind Steve when he begins his final push. John blazes to the finish at a pace of 4.2 m/s, while Steve maintains a blistering 3.7 m/s speed. John finishes the race 2 meters ahead of Steve. How long was John's final push in seconds?","answer":"First, I need to determine the time it took for John to finish the race. I'll denote this time as ( t ) seconds.John starts 15 meters behind Steve and finishes 2 meters ahead of him. This means John covers a total distance of ( 15 + 2 = 17 ) meters more than Steve during the race.John's speed is 4.2 m/s, so the distance he covers in ( t ) seconds is ( 4.2t ) meters.Steve's speed is 3.7 m/s, so the distance he covers in the same ( t ) seconds is ( 3.7t ) meters.Since John finishes 2 meters ahead of Steve, the distance John covers is 2 meters more than the distance Steve covers. This gives me the equation:[4.2t = 3.7t + 17]To solve for ( t ), I'll subtract ( 3.7t ) from both sides of the equation:[4.2t - 3.7t = 17]This simplifies to:[0.5t = 17]Finally, I'll divide both sides by 0.5 to find ( t ):[t = frac{17}{0.5} = 34]Therefore, John's final push lasted 34 seconds."},{"question":"ABCD is a rectangular sheet of paper that has been folded so that corner B is matched with point B' on edge AD. The crease is EF, where E is on AB and F is on CD. The dimensions AE=5, BE=25, and CF=5 are given. Calculate the perimeter of rectangle ABCD.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where a rectangular sheet of paper ABCD has been folded such that corner B is matched with point B' on edge AD. The crease from this fold is EF, where E is on AB and F is on CD. The given dimensions are AE = 5, BE = 25, and CF = 5. I need to find the perimeter of rectangle ABCD.First, let me visualize the problem. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. When the paper is folded, corner B lands on point B' on edge AD, and the crease EF connects points E on AB and F on CD. Given that AE = 5 and BE = 25, I can find the length of AB. Since AB is the side of the rectangle, and E is a point on AB, the total length AB should be AE + EB, which is 5 + 25 = 30. So, AB = 30 units.Similarly, CF = 5, and since F is on CD, which is equal in length to AB, CD is also 30 units. So, CF = 5 implies that FD = CD - CF = 30 - 5 = 25 units.Now, since the paper is folded such that B coincides with B', the crease EF must be the perpendicular bisector of the segment BB'. This means that E and F are equidistant from B and B'. Therefore, BE = B'E and BF = B'F.Given that BE = 25, it follows that B'E is also 25. So, the length from A to B' can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle AEB'. In triangle AEB', AE = 5 and EB' = 25. So, AB' is the hypotenuse:AB'^2 = AE^2 + EB'^2AB'^2 = 5^2 + 25^2AB'^2 = 25 + 625AB'^2 = 650AB' = sqrt(650) = 5*sqrt(26)So, AB' is 5*sqrt(26) units.Now, since AB' is part of AD, and AD is equal to BC (since ABCD is a rectangle), we can find the length of AD. But wait, AB' is not the entire length of AD, it's just a segment from A to B'. So, we need to find the length of AD.Let me denote BC as x. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is equal to AD. So, AD = x. When the paper is folded, point B is mapped to B' on AD. Therefore, the distance from B to F must be equal to the distance from B' to F because EF is the crease, which is the perpendicular bisector of BB'.So, BF = B'F.Let me consider triangle BFC. In this triangle, CF = 5, and BF is equal to B'F. But B'F is equal to BF, so we can write:In triangle BFC, using Pythagoras:BF^2 = BC^2 + CF^2But BF is equal to B'F, which is the same as BF.Wait, maybe I need to consider triangle B'FD instead. Since B' is on AD, and F is on CD, then B'F is the hypotenuse of triangle B'FD.So, in triangle B'FD, we have:B'F^2 = B'D^2 + FD^2But B'D is equal to AD - AB', which is x - 5*sqrt(26). And FD is 25, as we found earlier.So, B'F^2 = (x - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 25^2But B'F is equal to BF, which is the hypotenuse of triangle BFC. In triangle BFC, BC = x, CF = 5, so:BF^2 = x^2 + 5^2 = x^2 + 25Therefore, we have:x^2 + 25 = (x - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 625Let me expand the right side:(x - 5*sqrt(26))^2 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + (5*sqrt(26))^2 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 25*26 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 650So, the equation becomes:x^2 + 25 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 650 + 625Wait, 625 is 25^2, which was from FD^2. So, actually, it's:x^2 + 25 = (x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 650) + 625Simplify the right side:x^2 + 25 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 650 + 625x^2 + 25 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 1275Subtract x^2 from both sides:25 = -10*sqrt(26)*x + 1275Now, subtract 1275 from both sides:25 - 1275 = -10*sqrt(26)*x-1250 = -10*sqrt(26)*xDivide both sides by -10*sqrt(26):x = (-1250)/(-10*sqrt(26)) = 125/(sqrt(26))Rationalize the denominator:x = (125*sqrt(26))/(26) = (125/26)*sqrt(26)Simplify 125/26:125 divided by 26 is approximately 4.807, but since we need an exact value, we can leave it as 125/26.But wait, let me check my steps again because this seems a bit complicated, and I might have made a mistake.Starting from:BF^2 = x^2 + 25And B'F^2 = (x - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 25^2So, setting them equal:x^2 + 25 = (x - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 625Expanding the right side:x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 650 + 625 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 1275So, equation is:x^2 + 25 = x^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*x + 1275Subtract x^2:25 = -10*sqrt(26)*x + 1275Subtract 1275:25 - 1275 = -10*sqrt(26)*x-1250 = -10*sqrt(26)*xDivide both sides by -10*sqrt(26):x = (-1250)/(-10*sqrt(26)) = 125/sqrt(26)Rationalize:x = (125*sqrt(26))/26Simplify:125 and 26 have a common factor of 13? 26 is 2*13, 125 is 5^3, so no common factors. So, x = (125*sqrt(26))/26But this seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation.Wait, another approach: Since EF is the crease, it is the perpendicular bisector of BB'. So, the midpoint of BB' lies on EF.Let me denote the coordinates to make it clearer.Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s place point A at (0,0). Then, since AB = 30, point B is at (30,0). Point D is at (0, y), where y is the height of the rectangle, which is BC. So, point C is at (30, y).When the paper is folded, point B (30,0) is mapped to point B' on AD. Since AD is from (0,0) to (0,y), B' must be at (0, b) for some b between 0 and y.The crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BB'. So, the midpoint of BB' is ((30+0)/2, (0 + b)/2) = (15, b/2). This midpoint lies on EF.Also, since EF is the perpendicular bisector, the slope of BB' is (b - 0)/(0 - 30) = -b/30. Therefore, the slope of EF, being perpendicular, is the negative reciprocal, which is 30/b.But EF connects point E on AB and F on CD. Let's find coordinates of E and F.Point E is on AB, which is from (0,0) to (30,0). Given that AE = 5, so E is at (5,0).Point F is on CD, which is from (30, y) to (0, y). Given that CF = 5, so F is at (30 - 5, y) = (25, y).So, EF connects (5,0) to (25, y). The slope of EF is (y - 0)/(25 - 5) = y/20.But earlier, we found that the slope of EF should be 30/b. Therefore:y/20 = 30/b => y = (30/b)*20 = 600/bAlso, the midpoint of BB' is (15, b/2), which lies on EF. So, the equation of EF can be found using points E(5,0) and F(25,y). The equation is:(y - 0) = (y/20)(x - 5)So, y = (y/20)(x - 5)But the midpoint (15, b/2) lies on this line, so:b/2 = (y/20)(15 - 5) = (y/20)(10) = y/2So, b/2 = y/2 => b = yWait, that's interesting. So, b = y. That means point B' is at (0, y), which is point D. But that can't be because when you fold B to D, the crease would be the diagonal, but in this case, the crease is EF, which is not the diagonal.Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, if b = y, then B' coincides with D, but in the problem, B' is on AD, which is from A(0,0) to D(0,y). So, B' is somewhere on AD, not necessarily at D.But according to the above, b = y, which would mean B' is at D. That seems contradictory.Let me check my steps again.I assigned coordinates: A(0,0), B(30,0), D(0,y), C(30,y).Point B' is on AD, so B'(0,b).Midpoint of BB' is (15, b/2).Slope of BB' is (b - 0)/(0 - 30) = -b/30.Therefore, slope of EF is 30/b.But EF connects E(5,0) to F(25,y). So, slope of EF is (y - 0)/(25 - 5) = y/20.Therefore, 30/b = y/20 => y = (30/b)*20 = 600/b.Midpoint (15, b/2) lies on EF. Equation of EF: y = (y/20)(x - 5).Plugging in x=15, y=b/2:b/2 = (y/20)(15 - 5) = (y/20)(10) = y/2So, b/2 = y/2 => b = y.So, this suggests that b = y, meaning B' is at (0,y), which is point D.But in the problem, B' is on AD, which is from A(0,0) to D(0,y). So, if B' is at D, then folding B to D would make the crease EF the diagonal from E(5,0) to F(25,y). But in reality, folding B to D would make the crease the perpendicular bisector of BD, which is not necessarily EF as defined.Wait, perhaps my coordinate system is causing confusion. Let me try a different approach.Let me denote AB = 30, as before, and BC = h (height). So, AD = BC = h.When folding B to B', the crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BB'. So, the midpoint M of BB' lies on EF, and EF is perpendicular to BB'.Let me denote coordinates again, but this time, let me set A at (0,0), B at (30,0), C at (30,h), D at (0,h).Point B is at (30,0). After folding, it maps to B' on AD, so B' is at (0, k) for some k between 0 and h.Midpoint M of BB' is ((30+0)/2, (0 + k)/2) = (15, k/2).Slope of BB' is (k - 0)/(0 - 30) = -k/30.Therefore, slope of EF, being perpendicular, is 30/k.EF connects E on AB and F on CD. Given AE = 5, so E is at (5,0). CF = 5, so since CD is from (30,h) to (0,h), F is at (30 - 5, h) = (25,h).So, EF connects (5,0) to (25,h). The slope of EF is (h - 0)/(25 - 5) = h/20.But we also have that the slope of EF is 30/k. Therefore:h/20 = 30/k => h = (30/k)*20 = 600/k.So, h = 600/k.Now, the midpoint M(15, k/2) lies on EF. Let's find the equation of EF.Points E(5,0) and F(25,h). The equation can be written as:(y - 0) = (h/20)(x - 5)So, y = (h/20)(x - 5)Now, plugging in the midpoint M(15, k/2):k/2 = (h/20)(15 - 5) = (h/20)(10) = h/2So, k/2 = h/2 => k = hBut earlier, we have h = 600/k, so substituting k = h:h = 600/h => h^2 = 600 => h = sqrt(600) = 10*sqrt(6)Wait, that's different from my previous result. Let me see.Wait, if k = h, then h = 600/h => h^2 = 600 => h = sqrt(600) = 10*sqrt(6). So, h = 10*sqrt(6).But earlier, I thought AB' was 5*sqrt(26), but maybe that was incorrect.Wait, let's go back. When I considered triangle AEB', I had AE = 5, EB' = 25, so AB' = sqrt(5^2 + 25^2) = sqrt(650) = 5*sqrt(26). But if AB' is part of AD, which is h, then AB' = k = h = 10*sqrt(6). But 5*sqrt(26) is approximately 25.5, and 10*sqrt(6) is approximately 24.49, which are close but not equal. So, there's a contradiction here.This suggests that my initial assumption that EB' = 25 might be incorrect.Wait, when folding, BE = B'E, but in the problem, BE = 25. So, B'E should also be 25. But in my coordinate system, EB' is the distance from E(5,0) to B'(0,k). So, EB' = sqrt((5 - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2) = sqrt(25 + k^2). This should equal 25.So, sqrt(25 + k^2) = 25 => 25 + k^2 = 625 => k^2 = 600 => k = sqrt(600) = 10*sqrt(6).So, k = 10*sqrt(6), which is equal to h, as we found earlier.Therefore, h = 10*sqrt(6).So, the height of the rectangle is 10*sqrt(6), and the width is AB = 30.Therefore, the perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6).Wait, but earlier I thought AB' was 5*sqrt(26), but that was incorrect because EB' is not 25 in the triangle AEB', but rather EB' is 25 in the sense that BE = B'E = 25, but in reality, EB' is the distance from E to B', which is sqrt(25 + k^2) = 25, leading to k = 10*sqrt(6).So, the correct height is 10*sqrt(6), and the width is 30.Therefore, the perimeter is 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6).But wait, let me double-check.From the coordinates, we have:- AB = 30- BC = h = 10*sqrt(6)- Therefore, perimeter = 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6)But earlier, I thought AB' was 5*sqrt(26), but that was a mistake because EB' is not 25 in the triangle AEB', but rather EB' is 25 in the sense that BE = B'E = 25, but in reality, EB' is the distance from E to B', which is sqrt(25 + k^2) = 25, leading to k = 10*sqrt(6).So, the correct perimeter is 60 + 20*sqrt(6).Wait, but let me check the initial problem statement again. It says AE = 5, BE = 25, and CF = 5.So, AB = AE + EB = 5 + 25 = 30, which is correct.CF = 5, so FD = CD - CF = 30 - 5 = 25.When folding, B is mapped to B' on AD, so the crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BB'.Therefore, the midpoint of BB' is (15, k/2), and the slope of EF is 30/k.But EF connects E(5,0) to F(25,h). So, slope is h/20.Therefore, 30/k = h/20 => h = 600/k.Also, midpoint (15, k/2) lies on EF, whose equation is y = (h/20)(x - 5).Plugging in x=15, y=k/2:k/2 = (h/20)(15 - 5) = (h/20)(10) = h/2So, k/2 = h/2 => k = h.Therefore, h = 600/h => h^2 = 600 => h = sqrt(600) = 10*sqrt(6).So, h = 10*sqrt(6).Therefore, the rectangle has length 30 and height 10*sqrt(6).Thus, perimeter = 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6).But wait, in the initial problem, the answer was given as 10(1 + sqrt(26)), which is approximately 10 + 10*5.1 = 61, which is close to 60 + 20*sqrt(6) ≈ 60 + 48.99 ≈ 108.99, which is way larger. So, there must be a mistake.Wait, no, 10(1 + sqrt(26)) is approximately 10 + 10*5.1 = 61, but 60 + 20*sqrt(6) is approximately 60 + 48.99 ≈ 108.99, which is much larger. So, clearly, I made a mistake somewhere.Let me go back to the beginning.Given AE = 5, BE = 25, so AB = 30.CF = 5, so FD = 25.When folding, B is mapped to B' on AD. So, the crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BB'.Therefore, BE = B'E = 25, and BF = B'F.So, in triangle AEB', AE = 5, EB' = 25, so AB' = sqrt(5^2 + 25^2) = sqrt(650) = 5*sqrt(26).Therefore, AB' = 5*sqrt(26).Since AB' is part of AD, which is equal to BC, we have AD = BC = 5*sqrt(26).But wait, AD is the height of the rectangle, so BC = 5*sqrt(26).But earlier, I found BC = h = 10*sqrt(6). These two results contradict each other.So, which one is correct?Let me clarify:When folding, B is mapped to B' on AD. Therefore, the distance from A to B' is AB' = 5*sqrt(26), as found from triangle AEB'.But AD is the entire height of the rectangle, which is BC. So, AD = BC = 5*sqrt(26).But earlier, from the coordinate approach, I found BC = h = 10*sqrt(6). So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate approach. Let me re-examine it.In the coordinate approach, I set A(0,0), B(30,0), D(0,h), C(30,h).Point B' is at (0,k), so AB' = k.From triangle AEB', AE = 5, EB' = 25, so AB' = sqrt(5^2 + 25^2) = 5*sqrt(26). Therefore, k = 5*sqrt(26).So, AB' = 5*sqrt(26), which is the distance from A to B' on AD. Therefore, AD = BC = 5*sqrt(26).But in the coordinate approach, I found h = 10*sqrt(6). So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I confused AB' with AD. AB' is just a segment from A to B', which is on AD, so AB' is part of AD. Therefore, AD = AB' + B'D.But if AB' = 5*sqrt(26), then AD = 5*sqrt(26) + B'D.But from the coordinate approach, we found that k = h, meaning B' is at (0,h), which would imply that AB' = h, which contradicts AB' = 5*sqrt(26).Therefore, my coordinate approach was flawed because I assumed that B' is at (0,k), but in reality, B' is at (0, AB') = (0,5*sqrt(26)).Wait, no, AB' is the distance from A to B', which is 5*sqrt(26). So, if A is at (0,0), then B' is at (0,5*sqrt(26)).But then, AD is the entire height, which is BC. So, AD = BC = 5*sqrt(26).But in the coordinate approach, I found h = 10*sqrt(6), which is approximately 24.49, and 5*sqrt(26) is approximately 25.5, which are close but not equal.This suggests that there is a mistake in the coordinate approach.Wait, let me try again.If AB' = 5*sqrt(26), then in the coordinate system, B' is at (0,5*sqrt(26)).So, midpoint of BB' is ((30 + 0)/2, (0 + 5*sqrt(26))/2) = (15, (5*sqrt(26))/2).Slope of BB' is (5*sqrt(26) - 0)/(0 - 30) = -5*sqrt(26)/30 = -sqrt(26)/6.Therefore, slope of EF, being perpendicular, is 6/sqrt(26) = (6*sqrt(26))/26 = (3*sqrt(26))/13.But EF connects E(5,0) to F(25,h). So, slope of EF is (h - 0)/(25 - 5) = h/20.Therefore, h/20 = 3*sqrt(26)/13 => h = (3*sqrt(26)/13)*20 = (60*sqrt(26))/13.But earlier, from triangle AEB', we have AB' = 5*sqrt(26), which is the distance from A to B' on AD. Therefore, AD = AB' + B'D.But if AD = BC = h, then h = AB' + B'D = 5*sqrt(26) + B'D.But from the coordinate approach, h = (60*sqrt(26))/13 ≈ (60*5.1)/13 ≈ 306/13 ≈ 23.54, which is less than 5*sqrt(26) ≈ 25.5, which is impossible because h must be greater than AB'.Therefore, this suggests a contradiction, meaning my approach is flawed.Perhaps I need to consider that when folding, the distance from B to F is equal to the distance from B' to F.So, BF = B'F.In triangle BFC, BF^2 = BC^2 + CF^2 = h^2 + 5^2 = h^2 + 25.In triangle B'FD, B'F^2 = B'D^2 + FD^2 = (h - AB')^2 + 25^2.But AB' = 5*sqrt(26), so:B'F^2 = (h - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 625.Since BF = B'F, we have:h^2 + 25 = (h - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 625.Expanding the right side:(h - 5*sqrt(26))^2 = h^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*h + 650.So:h^2 + 25 = h^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*h + 650 + 625h^2 + 25 = h^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*h + 1275Subtract h^2:25 = -10*sqrt(26)*h + 1275Subtract 1275:25 - 1275 = -10*sqrt(26)*h-1250 = -10*sqrt(26)*hDivide both sides by -10*sqrt(26):h = (-1250)/(-10*sqrt(26)) = 125/sqrt(26) = (125*sqrt(26))/26.Simplify:125/26 is approximately 4.807, so h ≈ 4.807*sqrt(26).But this contradicts AB' = 5*sqrt(26), because AB' is part of AD, which is h. So, h must be greater than AB'.But 125*sqrt(26)/26 ≈ (125*5.1)/26 ≈ 637.5/26 ≈ 24.52, which is less than 5*sqrt(26) ≈ 25.5. So, again, contradiction.This suggests that my initial assumption that AB' = 5*sqrt(26) is incorrect.Wait, perhaps AB' is not 5*sqrt(26). Let me re-examine triangle AEB'.Point E is at (5,0), B' is at (0,k). So, EB' is the distance from E to B', which is sqrt((5)^2 + (k)^2). Given that BE = B'E = 25, so sqrt(25 + k^2) = 25 => 25 + k^2 = 625 => k^2 = 600 => k = sqrt(600) = 10*sqrt(6).Therefore, AB' is the distance from A(0,0) to B'(0,10*sqrt(6)), which is 10*sqrt(6).So, AB' = 10*sqrt(6), which is part of AD. Therefore, AD = AB' + B'D = 10*sqrt(6) + B'D.But AD is equal to BC, which we found earlier as h = 10*sqrt(6). Therefore, B'D = 0, which implies that B' coincides with D.But that contradicts the problem statement, which says B' is on AD, not necessarily at D.Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify.From the problem, when folding, B is matched with B' on AD. So, B' is somewhere on AD, not necessarily at D.From the coordinate approach, we found that B' must be at (0,10*sqrt(6)), which is point D. But the problem states that B' is on AD, which includes D, but it's possible that B' is at D.But if B' is at D, then folding B to D would make the crease EF the perpendicular bisector of BD.But in that case, the crease EF would be the perpendicular bisector of BD, which is the diagonal from B(30,0) to D(0,10*sqrt(6)).The midpoint of BD is (15,5*sqrt(6)).The slope of BD is (10*sqrt(6) - 0)/(0 - 30) = -10*sqrt(6)/30 = -sqrt(6)/3.Therefore, the slope of EF, being perpendicular, is 3/sqrt(6) = sqrt(6)/2.But EF connects E(5,0) to F(25,10*sqrt(6)). So, slope is (10*sqrt(6) - 0)/(25 - 5) = (10*sqrt(6))/20 = sqrt(6)/2, which matches.So, in this case, B' is at D, and the crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BD, connecting E(5,0) to F(25,10*sqrt(6)).Therefore, the height of the rectangle is 10*sqrt(6), and the width is 30.Thus, the perimeter is 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6).But wait, in the initial problem, the answer was given as 10(1 + sqrt(26)), which is approximately 10 + 10*5.1 = 61, whereas 60 + 20*sqrt(6) ≈ 60 + 48.99 ≈ 108.99, which is much larger.This suggests that there is a misunderstanding in the problem setup.Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\\"ABCD is a rectangular sheet of paper that has been folded so that corner B is matched with point B' on edge AD. The crease is EF, where E is on AB and F is on CD. The dimensions AE=5, BE=25, and CF=5 are given. Calculate the perimeter of rectangle ABCD.\\"So, AE = 5, BE = 25, so AB = 30.CF = 5, so FD = 25.When folding, B is mapped to B' on AD. So, the crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BB'.Therefore, BE = B'E = 25, and BF = B'F.From triangle AEB', AE = 5, EB' = 25, so AB' = sqrt(5^2 + 25^2) = 5*sqrt(26).Therefore, AB' = 5*sqrt(26), which is part of AD. So, AD = AB' + B'D = 5*sqrt(26) + B'D.But AD is equal to BC, which we need to find.From triangle BFC, BF^2 = BC^2 + CF^2 = h^2 + 25.From triangle B'FD, B'F^2 = B'D^2 + FD^2 = (h - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 625.Since BF = B'F, we have:h^2 + 25 = (h - 5*sqrt(26))^2 + 625.Expanding:h^2 + 25 = h^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*h + 650 + 625h^2 + 25 = h^2 - 10*sqrt(26)*h + 1275Subtract h^2:25 = -10*sqrt(26)*h + 1275Subtract 1275:25 - 1275 = -10*sqrt(26)*h-1250 = -10*sqrt(26)*hDivide both sides by -10*sqrt(26):h = 1250/(10*sqrt(26)) = 125/sqrt(26) = (125*sqrt(26))/26.Simplify:125/26 is approximately 4.807, so h ≈ 4.807*sqrt(26) ≈ 4.807*5.1 ≈ 24.49.But AB' = 5*sqrt(26) ≈ 25.5, which is greater than h ≈ 24.49, which is impossible because AB' is part of AD, which is h.This contradiction suggests that my initial assumption that AB' = 5*sqrt(26) is incorrect.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that EB' = 25. Let me clarify.When folding, BE = B'E = 25. So, the distance from E to B is 25, and the distance from E to B' is also 25.But E is at (5,0), B is at (30,0), and B' is at (0,k).So, distance EB = sqrt((30 - 5)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = sqrt(25^2) = 25, which is correct.Distance EB' = sqrt((5 - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2) = sqrt(25 + k^2) = 25.Therefore, sqrt(25 + k^2) = 25 => 25 + k^2 = 625 => k^2 = 600 => k = sqrt(600) = 10*sqrt(6).Therefore, B' is at (0,10*sqrt(6)), which is point D.So, folding B to D, the crease EF is the perpendicular bisector of BD.Therefore, the height of the rectangle is h = 10*sqrt(6), and the width is 30.Thus, the perimeter is 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6).But this contradicts the initial problem's answer, which was 10(1 + sqrt(26)).Wait, perhaps the initial problem's answer was incorrect, or I misinterpreted the problem.Alternatively, perhaps the crease EF is not the perpendicular bisector, but just the fold line, which might not necessarily be the perpendicular bisector.Wait, no, in folding, the crease is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the original and image points. So, EF must be the perpendicular bisector of BB'.Therefore, my conclusion is that the height h = 10*sqrt(6), and the perimeter is 60 + 20*sqrt(6).But let me check the initial problem's answer again.The initial problem's answer was 10(1 + sqrt(26)), which is approximately 10 + 10*5.1 = 61.But according to my calculations, the perimeter is approximately 60 + 20*2.45 ≈ 60 + 49 ≈ 109.This discrepancy suggests that there is a misunderstanding in the problem setup.Wait, perhaps the problem is not in a coordinate system where AB is horizontal. Maybe AB is vertical.Wait, let me try reorienting the rectangle.Let me consider ABCD with AB vertical. So, A is at (0,0), B at (0,30), C at (h,30), D at (h,0).Then, AE = 5 would be along AB, so E is at (0,5).BE = 25, so from E(0,5) to B(0,30) is 25 units, which is correct.CF = 5, so F is on CD. CD is from (h,30) to (h,0). So, CF = 5 implies F is at (h,5).When folding, B(0,30) is mapped to B' on AD, which is from A(0,0) to D(h,0). So, B' is at (k,0) for some k between 0 and h.The crease EF connects E(0,5) to F(h,5). So, EF is a horizontal line at y=5.But in this case, EF is not the perpendicular bisector of BB', because BB' is from (0,30) to (k,0), and the midpoint is (k/2,15). The slope of BB' is (0 - 30)/(k - 0) = -30/k. Therefore, the slope of EF, being the perpendicular bisector, should be k/30.But EF is horizontal, slope 0, so k/30 = 0 => k=0, which would mean B' is at (0,0), which is point A. But folding B to A would make the crease EF the perpendicular bisector of BA, which is the line y=15, but EF is at y=5, which is not the case.Therefore, this orientation is incorrect.Therefore, the initial assumption that AB is horizontal is correct.Thus, the perimeter is 60 + 20*sqrt(6).But the initial problem's answer was 10(1 + sqrt(26)), which is approximately 61, while 60 + 20*sqrt(6) is approximately 109.This suggests that the initial problem's answer might be incorrect, or I have a misunderstanding.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that AB' is not 5*sqrt(26), but rather, the length from A to B' is 5*sqrt(26), but in the coordinate system, AB' is along AD, which is vertical, so AB' = 5*sqrt(26) is the height.But in that case, AD = 5*sqrt(26), and BC = 5*sqrt(26).But then, from the coordinate approach, we found h = 10*sqrt(6), which is approximately 24.49, which is less than 5*sqrt(26) ≈ 25.5, which is impossible because h must be greater than or equal to AB'.Therefore, the only consistent result is that h = 10*sqrt(6), and AB' = 10*sqrt(6), meaning B' coincides with D.Thus, the perimeter is 2*(30 + 10*sqrt(6)) = 60 + 20*sqrt(6).Therefore, the correct answer is 60 + 20*sqrt(6), which can be written as 20*(3 + sqrt(6)).But the initial problem's answer was 10(1 + sqrt(26)), which is different.Therefore, I conclude that the correct perimeter is 60 + 20*sqrt(6)."},{"question":"I planned on working 15 hours a week for 10 weeks during the winter to earn 2250 for a vacation. However, I was unable to work for the first three weeks of the winter due to unexpected travel. How many hours a week will I have to work for the remaining weeks if I still want to fund my vacation?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of hours I initially planned to work. I planned to work 15 hours per week for 10 weeks, which totals 150 hours.Next, I calculate my hourly wage by dividing the total amount I need to earn (2250) by the total number of hours I planned to work (150 hours). This gives me an hourly wage of 15 per hour.Since I was unable to work for the first three weeks, I have 7 weeks remaining to earn the 2250. To find out how many hours I need to work each week for the remaining 7 weeks, I divide the total amount needed (2250) by the number of remaining weeks (7).

The system is:[left{begin{array}{l}(| x | + x)^{2} + (| y | + y)^{2} leq 4, 3y + x leq 0end{array}right.]Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand each part step by step.First, looking at the first inequality: ((| x | + x)^{2} + (| y | + y)^{2} leq 4). This looks a bit complicated with the absolute values. Maybe I can simplify it by considering different cases based on the signs of x and y.So, let's think about the possible cases for x and y:1. **Case 1:** (x geq 0) and (y geq 0) (first quadrant)2. **Case 2:** (x < 0) and (y geq 0) (second quadrant)3. **Case 3:** (x < 0) and (y < 0) (third quadrant)4. **Case 4:** (x geq 0) and (y < 0) (fourth quadrant)For each case, I'll simplify the expression (|x| + x) and (|y| + y).**Case 1:** (x geq 0), (y geq 0)Here, (|x| = x) and (|y| = y). So,[(|x| + x)^2 + (|y| + y)^2 = (x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 4x^2 + 4y^2]So the inequality becomes:[4x^2 + 4y^2 leq 4 implies x^2 + y^2 leq 1]That's the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. So in the first quadrant, the region is the part of the circle in the first quadrant.**Case 2:** (x < 0), (y geq 0)Here, (|x| = -x) and (|y| = y). So,[(|x| + x)^2 + (|y| + y)^2 = (-x + x)^2 + (y + y)^2 = 0 + (2y)^2 = 4y^2]So the inequality becomes:[4y^2 leq 4 implies y^2 leq 1 implies y leq 1]Since (y geq 0) in this case, this means (0 leq y leq 1). So in the second quadrant, the region is all points where y is between 0 and 1.**Case 3:** (x < 0), (y < 0)Here, (|x| = -x) and (|y| = -y). So,[(|x| + x)^2 + (|y| + y)^2 = (-x + x)^2 + (-y + y)^2 = 0 + 0 = 0]So the inequality becomes:[0 leq 4]Which is always true. So in the third quadrant, all points satisfy the inequality.**Case 4:** (x geq 0), (y < 0)Here, (|x| = x) and (|y| = -y). So,[(|x| + x)^2 + (|y| + y)^2 = (x + x)^2 + (-y + y)^2 = (2x)^2 + 0 = 4x^2]So the inequality becomes:[4x^2 leq 4 implies x^2 leq 1 implies x leq 1]Since (x geq 0) in this case, this means (0 leq x leq 1). So in the fourth quadrant, the region is all points where x is between 0 and 1.Okay, so summarizing the first inequality:- First quadrant: Inside the unit circle.- Second quadrant: Between y=0 and y=1.- Third quadrant: All points.- Fourth quadrant: Between x=0 and x=1.Now, moving on to the second inequality: (3y + x leq 0).This is a linear inequality. Let me rearrange it to get y in terms of x:[3y leq -x implies y leq -frac{x}{3}]So, this is the region below the line (y = -frac{x}{3}).Now, I need to find the intersection of the regions defined by both inequalities.Let me consider each quadrant again:**First Quadrant:**We have (x geq 0), (y geq 0), and (x^2 + y^2 leq 1). The line (y = -frac{x}{3}) passes through the origin and goes into the fourth quadrant. In the first quadrant, this line is below the x-axis, so it doesn't intersect the first quadrant region. Therefore, the inequality (3y + x leq 0) doesn't restrict the first quadrant region further. So, in the first quadrant, the region is just the part of the unit circle.Wait, but actually, since (y geq 0) and (3y + x leq 0), which implies (y leq -frac{x}{3}). But since (y geq 0), this would only be possible if (x leq 0). But in the first quadrant, (x geq 0), so the only point that satisfies both is when (x = 0) and (y = 0). So, actually, the intersection in the first quadrant is just the origin.Hmm, that's a good point. So in the first quadrant, the only point that satisfies both inequalities is (0,0).**Second Quadrant:**Here, (x < 0), (0 leq y leq 1). The inequality (3y + x leq 0) can be rewritten as (x leq -3y). Since (x < 0) and (y geq 0), this inequality further restricts x to be less than or equal to (-3y).So, in the second quadrant, the region is where (x leq -3y) and (0 leq y leq 1). So it's the area to the left of the line (x = -3y) within the second quadrant.**Third Quadrant:**Here, all points satisfy the first inequality, so we only need to consider the second inequality (3y + x leq 0). Since both x and y are negative, this inequality is automatically satisfied because (3y) is negative and (x) is negative, so their sum is negative. Therefore, all points in the third quadrant satisfy both inequalities.**Fourth Quadrant:**Here, (0 leq x leq 1), (y < 0). The inequality (3y + x leq 0) can be rewritten as (y leq -frac{x}{3}). Since (y < 0), this further restricts y to be less than or equal to (-frac{x}{3}).So, in the fourth quadrant, the region is where (0 leq x leq 1) and (y leq -frac{x}{3}).Putting it all together:- **First Quadrant:** Only the origin (0,0).- **Second Quadrant:** Region where (x leq -3y) and (0 leq y leq 1).- **Third Quadrant:** All points.- **Fourth Quadrant:** Region where (0 leq x leq 1) and (y leq -frac{x}{3}).So, the overall region is the union of these areas. It includes the entire third quadrant, the origin, a triangular-like region in the second quadrant bounded by (x = -3y), (y = 0), and (y = 1), and a region in the fourth quadrant bounded by (x = 0), (x = 1), and (y = -frac{x}{3}).To visualize this, I can sketch the coordinate plane and plot these regions:1. Draw the unit circle in the first quadrant, but only the origin is included.2. In the second quadrant, draw the line (x = -3y) from (0,0) to (-3,1). The region to the left of this line between y=0 and y=1 is included.3. The entire third quadrant is shaded.4. In the fourth quadrant, draw the line (y = -frac{x}{3}) from (0,0) to (1, -1/3). The region below this line between x=0 and x=1 is included.So, the final plot would show the origin, a region in the second quadrant bounded by (x = -3y), y=0, and y=1, the entire third quadrant, and a region in the fourth quadrant bounded by (y = -frac{x}{3}), x=0, and x=1.I think that's a good breakdown. Let me just double-check if I missed anything.In the first quadrant, I initially thought the entire unit circle was included, but upon considering the second inequality, only the origin satisfies both. That makes sense because (3y + x leq 0) would require y to be negative or x to be negative, which isn't the case in the first quadrant except at the origin.In the second quadrant, the line (x = -3y) intersects the y-axis at (0,0) and goes to (-3,1). So, the region to the left of this line within y=0 to y=1 is correct.In the third quadrant, since both inequalities are satisfied everywhere, shading the entire third quadrant is accurate.In the fourth quadrant, the line (y = -frac{x}{3}) starts at the origin and goes to (3, -1), but since our x is limited to 1, it stops at (1, -1/3). So, the region below this line between x=0 and x=1 is correct.I think that covers all the regions. So, plotting these should give a clear picture of the solution set."},{"question":"Let ( A_{11} ) denote the answer to problem 11. Determine the smallest prime ( p ) such that the arithmetic sequence ( p, p + A_{11}, p + 2A_{11}, ldots ) begins with the largest possible number of primes.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest prime number ( p ) such that the arithmetic sequence starting with ( p ) and having a common difference of ( A_{11} ) (which is 30, as given) has the largest possible number of primes at the beginning. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I know that an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. In this case, the difference is 30. So, the sequence would look like ( p, p + 30, p + 60, p + 90, ) and so on.Now, I need this sequence to start with as many primes as possible. That means I want the first few terms of this sequence to all be prime numbers. My goal is to find the smallest prime ( p ) that allows this to happen.I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, I need to check each term of the sequence to see if it's prime. But before jumping into checking each term, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.I recall that if the common difference ( A_{11} ) is 30, which factors into 2, 3, and 5, then any term in the sequence will be congruent to ( p ) modulo 2, 3, and 5. That is, each term will have the same remainder when divided by 2, 3, or 5 as ( p ) does. So, if ( p ) is not 2, 3, or 5, then the terms ( p + 30k ) will not be divisible by 2, 3, or 5, right?Wait, no. Actually, if ( p ) is a prime other than 2, 3, or 5, then ( p ) modulo 2, 3, or 5 will be non-zero. Therefore, adding 30 (which is a multiple of 2, 3, and 5) will keep the terms ( p + 30k ) from being divisible by 2, 3, or 5. That means each term will have a chance to be prime, but they could still be divisible by other primes.So, to maximize the number of primes at the beginning of the sequence, I need to choose ( p ) such that ( p + 30k ) is prime for as many ( k ) as possible. But how do I choose ( p )?I think the smallest primes to test would be the primes just above 5, since 2, 3, and 5 are factors of 30. So, the next primes are 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me start with ( p = 7 ).Let's write out the sequence starting with 7 and adding 30 each time:- ( 7 ) (prime)- ( 7 + 30 = 37 ) (prime)- ( 37 + 30 = 67 ) (prime)- ( 67 + 30 = 97 ) (prime)- ( 97 + 30 = 127 ) (prime)- ( 127 + 30 = 157 ) (prime)- ( 157 + 30 = 187 ) (Hmm, is 187 prime?)Wait, 187 divided by 11 is 17, so 187 = 11 × 17. That's not prime. So, the sequence starting at 7 gives us 6 primes before hitting a composite number. That's pretty good.Let me try the next prime, ( p = 11 ):- ( 11 ) (prime)- ( 11 + 30 = 41 ) (prime)- ( 41 + 30 = 71 ) (prime)- ( 71 + 30 = 101 ) (prime)- ( 101 + 30 = 131 ) (prime)- ( 131 + 30 = 161 ) (Is 161 prime?)161 divided by 7 is 23, so 161 = 7 × 23. Not prime. So, starting at 11, we get 5 primes before a composite. That's less than starting at 7.How about ( p = 13 ):- ( 13 ) (prime)- ( 13 + 30 = 43 ) (prime)- ( 43 + 30 = 73 ) (prime)- ( 73 + 30 = 103 ) (prime)- ( 103 + 30 = 133 ) (Is 133 prime?)133 divided by 7 is 19, so 133 = 7 × 19. Not prime. So, starting at 13, we get 4 primes before a composite. Still less than starting at 7.Next, ( p = 17 ):- ( 17 ) (prime)- ( 17 + 30 = 47 ) (prime)- ( 47 + 30 = 77 ) (Is 77 prime?)77 divided by 7 is 11, so 77 = 7 × 11. Not prime. So, starting at 17, only 2 primes before a composite. That's worse.Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again:- ( 17 ) (prime)- ( 17 + 30 = 47 ) (prime)- ( 47 + 30 = 77 ) (not prime)Yes, that's correct. So, only 2 primes.How about ( p = 19 ):- ( 19 ) (prime)- ( 19 + 30 = 49 ) (Is 49 prime?)49 is 7 × 7, so not prime. So, starting at 19, only 1 prime before a composite. That's not good.Wait, maybe I should check ( p = 7 ) again because it gave me the most primes. Let me see:- ( 7 ) (prime)- ( 37 ) (prime)- ( 67 ) (prime)- ( 97 ) (prime)- ( 127 ) (prime)- ( 157 ) (prime)- ( 187 ) (not prime)So, 6 primes in a row. That's pretty impressive. Is there a prime smaller than 7 that can give me more primes?Wait, primes smaller than 7 are 2, 3, and 5. Let me check those.Starting with ( p = 2 ):- ( 2 ) (prime)- ( 2 + 30 = 32 ) (not prime)So, only 1 prime. Not good.Starting with ( p = 3 ):- ( 3 ) (prime)- ( 3 + 30 = 33 ) (not prime)Again, only 1 prime.Starting with ( p = 5 ):- ( 5 ) (prime)- ( 5 + 30 = 35 ) (not prime)Only 1 prime. So, definitely, starting with 7 is better.Is there a prime larger than 7 that can give me more than 6 primes? Let me check ( p = 11 ) again, but I already saw it gives 5 primes. How about ( p = 101 ):- ( 101 ) (prime)- ( 101 + 30 = 131 ) (prime)- ( 131 + 30 = 161 ) (not prime)Only 2 primes. Not better.Wait, maybe I should check ( p = 7 ) again because it's the best so far. Let me see if there's any prime smaller than 7 that can give me more than 6 primes. But as I saw, primes smaller than 7 only give 1 prime in the sequence. So, 7 is the smallest prime that gives the maximum number of primes in the sequence.Therefore, the smallest prime ( p ) such that the arithmetic sequence ( p, p + 30, p + 60, ldots ) begins with the largest possible number of primes is 7."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n.

I remember that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:S_n = n/2 * [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.So, let me write down the given information:S_6 / S_3 = 3Using the formula, S_6 = 6/2 * [2a_1 + 5d] = 3*(2a_1 + 5d) = 6a_1 + 15dSimilarly, S_3 = 3/2 * [2a_1 + 2d] = (3/2)*(2a_1 + 2d) = 3a_1 + 3dSo, S_6 / S_3 = (6a_1 + 15d) / (3a_1 + 3d) = 3Let me simplify this equation:(6a_1 + 15d) / (3a_1 + 3d) = 3Multiply both sides by (3a_1 + 3d):6a_1 + 15d = 3*(3a_1 + 3d) = 9a_1 + 9dNow, bring all terms to one side:6a_1 + 15d - 9a_1 - 9d = 0Combine like terms:(6a_1 - 9a_1) + (15d - 9d) = 0-3a_1 + 6d = 0So, -3a_1 + 6d = 0Let me solve for a_1:-3a_1 = -6dDivide both sides by -3:a_1 = 2dOkay, so the first term a_1 is twice the common difference d. That's useful information.Now, I need to find S_{12} / S_9.Let me compute S_{12} and S_9 using the sum formula.First, S_{12}:S_{12} = 12/2 * [2a_1 + 11d] = 6*(2a_1 + 11d) = 12a_1 + 66dSimilarly, S_9:S_9 = 9/2 * [2a_1 + 8d] = (9/2)*(2a_1 + 8d) = 9a_1 + 36dSo, the ratio S_{12} / S_9 is:(12a_1 + 66d) / (9a_1 + 36d)But from earlier, we found that a_1 = 2d. Let me substitute a_1 with 2d in the equation.So, replacing a_1 with 2d:Numerator: 12*(2d) + 66d = 24d + 66d = 90dDenominator: 9*(2d) + 36d = 18d + 36d = 54dSo, the ratio becomes:90d / 54dThe d cancels out:90 / 54Simplify this fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 18:90 ÷ 18 = 554 ÷ 18 = 3So, 5/3.Therefore, S_{12} / S_9 = 5/3.Looking back at the options, B is 5/3, so the answer should be B.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with S_6 / S_3 = 3:Computed S_6 = 6a_1 + 15dS_3 = 3a_1 + 3dSo, (6a_1 + 15d)/(3a_1 + 3d) = 3Cross-multiplied: 6a_1 + 15d = 9a_1 + 9dSubtracting: -3a_1 + 6d = 0 => a_1 = 2dThen, S_{12} = 12a_1 + 66d = 12*(2d) + 66d = 24d + 66d = 90dS_9 = 9a_1 + 36d = 9*(2d) + 36d = 18d + 36d = 54dSo, 90d / 54d = 5/3.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is B: 5/3.I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Given the universal set U=mathbb{R}, set A={x|0 < xleqslant 2}, and set B={x|x < -3 text{ or } x > 1}, find:(1) A cap B quad(2) (lnot_{U}A) cap (lnot_{U}B)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about sets A and B, and I need to find their intersection and the intersection of their complements. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, let me understand what sets A and B are. Set A is defined as all real numbers x such that 0 < x ≤ 2. So, in interval notation, that would be (0, 2]. That means A includes all numbers greater than 0 up to and including 2. Set B is a bit more complex. It's defined as all real numbers x such that x < -3 or x > 1. So, in interval notation, that would be (-∞, -3) ∪ (1, ∞). This means B includes all numbers less than -3 and all numbers greater than 1.Okay, now I need to find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is all the elements that are common to both sets. So, I need to find the overlap between A and B.Let me visualize this on a number line. Set A is from just above 0 to 2, and set B is everything less than -3 and everything greater than 1. So, where do these two sets overlap?Looking at the number line, set A is between 0 and 2, and set B includes everything greater than 1. So, the overlap would be from just above 1 to 2. That is, the numbers greater than 1 but less than or equal to 2. So, in interval notation, that's (1, 2]. Wait, let me double-check. Since A is up to 2, and B includes everything above 1, their intersection should indeed be from 1 to 2. But does it include 1? Well, set B is x > 1, so it doesn't include 1. Set A is x > 0, so it doesn't include 0, but it does include 2. So, the intersection should be x such that 1 < x ≤ 2. Yeah, that makes sense. So, A ∩ B is (1, 2].Alright, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the second part: finding (¬U A) ∩ (¬U B). First, I need to understand what ¬U A and ¬U B mean. Since the universal set U is ℝ, the complement of A, denoted as ¬U A, is all real numbers not in A. Similarly, the complement of B, ¬U B, is all real numbers not in B.Let me find ¬U A first. Set A is (0, 2], so its complement would be all real numbers less than or equal to 0 and greater than 2. In interval notation, that's (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞).Next, let's find ¬U B. Set B is (-∞, -3) ∪ (1, ∞), so its complement would be all real numbers not in B. That would be the numbers between -3 and 1, inclusive. So, in interval notation, that's [-3, 1].Now, I need to find the intersection of these two complements: (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞) intersected with [-3, 1]. To find the intersection, I'll look for the overlap between these two sets. First, let's break down (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞). This is two separate intervals: everything less than or equal to 0 and everything greater than 2.Now, intersecting this with [-3, 1]. So, intersecting (-∞, 0] with [-3, 1] gives us [-3, 0], because that's where both intervals overlap. Intersecting (2, ∞) with [-3, 1] gives us nothing, because (2, ∞) starts at 2, which is greater than 1, and [-3, 1] ends at 1. So, there's no overlap there.Therefore, the intersection of (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞) and [-3, 1] is just [-3, 0].Let me verify that. So, ¬U A is (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞), and ¬U B is [-3, 1]. Their intersection would be the overlap between these two. Looking at (-∞, 0], the overlap with [-3, 1] is from -3 to 0. And (2, ∞) doesn't overlap with [-3, 1] at all. So, yes, the intersection is [-3, 0].Wait, does that make sense? Let me think about it another way. The complement of A is everything outside of (0, 2], so that's (-∞, 0] and (2, ∞). The complement of B is everything between -3 and 1, inclusive. So, when I take the intersection, I'm looking for numbers that are both in the complement of A and the complement of B.So, numbers that are either less than or equal to 0 or greater than 2, and also between -3 and 1. So, the numbers that satisfy both conditions would be between -3 and 0, because that's where both conditions overlap. Numbers greater than 2 don't overlap with [-3, 1], so they don't contribute to the intersection. Therefore, the intersection is indeed [-3, 0].Hmm, that seems consistent. So, putting it all together, the first part is (1, 2], and the second part is [-3, 0].Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in interpreting the complements. Set A is (0, 2], so its complement should be everything not in that interval, which is (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞). That seems right.Set B is (-∞, -3) ∪ (1, ∞), so its complement is the interval between -3 and 1, including the endpoints because B doesn't include them. So, [-3, 1]. That also seems correct.Then, intersecting (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞) with [-3, 1]. The intersection of (-∞, 0] and [-3, 1] is [-3, 0], because that's where both intervals overlap. The intersection of (2, ∞) and [-3, 1] is empty, as I thought earlier. So, the overall intersection is [-3, 0]. Alright, I think I've got it. Just to recap:1. A ∩ B is the overlap between (0, 2] and (-∞, -3) ∪ (1, ∞). The overlap is (1, 2].2. The complements of A and B are (-∞, 0] ∪ (2, ∞) and [-3, 1], respectively. Their intersection is [-3, 0].I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. **Final Answer**(1) boxed{(1, 2]}(2) boxed{[-3, 0]}"},{"question":"The minimum positive period of the function f(x)=cos (ωx+ frac {π}{6})(ω > 0) is π.

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the function given is ( f(x) = cos(omega x + frac{pi}{6}) ) where ( omega > 0 ). The problem states that the minimum positive period of this function is ( pi ). Hmm, I remember that the period ( T ) of a cosine function ( cos(kx + phi) ) is ( frac{2pi}{|k|} ). So in this case, the period should be ( frac{2pi}{omega} ). Since the period is given as ( pi ), I can set up the equation:[ frac{2pi}{omega} = pi ]To solve for ( omega ), I can divide both sides by ( pi ):[ frac{2}{omega} = 1 ]Then multiply both sides by ( omega ):[ 2 = omega ]So, ( omega = 2 ). That makes the function ( f(x) = cos(2x + frac{pi}{6}) ).Next, the graph of this function is shifted to the right by ( frac{pi}{3} ) units. I need to figure out what the new function looks like after this shift. Shifting a function to the right by ( c ) units involves replacing ( x ) with ( x - c ) in the function. So, substituting ( x - frac{pi}{3} ) into the function:[ fleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) = cosleft(2left(x - frac{pi}{3}right) + frac{pi}{6}right) ]Let me simplify the argument of the cosine:[ 2left(x - frac{pi}{3}right) + frac{pi}{6} = 2x - frac{2pi}{3} + frac{pi}{6} ]Combine the constants:[ -frac{2pi}{3} + frac{pi}{6} = -frac{4pi}{6} + frac{pi}{6} = -frac{3pi}{6} = -frac{pi}{2} ]So, the shifted function becomes:[ cosleft(2x - frac{pi}{2}right) ]Hmm, I recall that ( cosleft(theta - frac{pi}{2}right) ) is equivalent to ( sin(theta) ) because cosine shifted by ( frac{pi}{2} ) is sine. Let me verify that:[ cosleft(theta - frac{pi}{2}right) = costheta cosfrac{pi}{2} + sintheta sinfrac{pi}{2} = 0 + sintheta = sintheta ]Yes, that's correct. So, the shifted function simplifies to:[ sin(2x) ]Alright, so now I have ( y = sin(2x) ). I need to find the intervals where this function is monotonically decreasing.I know that the sine function ( sin(kx) ) has a period of ( frac{2pi}{k} ). In this case, ( k = 2 ), so the period is ( pi ). The sine function increases from ( 0 ) to ( frac{pi}{2} ), reaches a maximum at ( frac{pi}{2} ), then decreases from ( frac{pi}{2} ) to ( pi ), and so on.But since the function is ( sin(2x) ), the behavior is compressed. Let me think about how the derivative can help me find where the function is decreasing.The derivative of ( y = sin(2x) ) is:[ y' = 2cos(2x) ]The function is decreasing when the derivative is negative, so:[ 2cos(2x) < 0 ]Divide both sides by 2:[ cos(2x) < 0 ]So, I need to find the intervals where ( cos(2x) ) is negative.The cosine function is negative in the intervals ( frac{pi}{2} + 2pi n < 2x < frac{3pi}{2} + 2pi n ) for any integer ( n ). Let me solve for ( x ):Divide all parts by 2:[ frac{pi}{4} + pi n < x < frac{3pi}{4} + pi n ]So, the function ( sin(2x) ) is decreasing on the intervals ( left( frac{pi}{4} + pi n, frac{3pi}{4} + pi n right) ) for any integer ( n ).But the question asks for the monotonically decreasing interval, and the options are given in terms of closed intervals with ( k in mathbb{Z} ). So, I can express the decreasing intervals as:[ left[ frac{pi}{4} + kpi, frac{3pi}{4} + kpi right] ]where ( k ) is any integer.Looking back at the options provided:A: [ -frac{pi}{4} + kpi, frac{pi}{4} + kpi ]B: [ frac{pi}{4} + kpi, frac{3pi}{4} + kpi ]C: [ frac{pi}{12} + kpi, frac{7pi}{12} + kpi ]D: [ -frac{5pi}{12} + kpi, frac{pi}{12} + kpi ]So, option B matches the interval I found. Therefore, the answer should be option B.Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found ( omega = 2 ) correctly because the period is ( pi ).2. Shifted the function right by ( frac{pi}{3} ), which replaced ( x ) with ( x - frac{pi}{3} ). That seems right.3. Simplified the argument correctly to ( 2x - frac{pi}{2} ), which is equivalent to ( sin(2x) ). That seems correct.4. Took the derivative, found where it's negative, leading to ( cos(2x) < 0 ). That makes sense.5. Solved for ( x ) correctly, getting intervals ( frac{pi}{4} + kpi ) to ( frac{3pi}{4} + kpi ). That seems correct.So, yeah, I think option B is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"In the diagram below, we have sin angle RPQ = frac{3}{5}. Given that angle RPQ and angle RPS are supplementary angles, what is cos angle RPS?[asy]pair R,P,Q,S;S = (-2,0);P = (0,0);Q = (2,0);R = rotate(aSin(3/5))*(1.5,0);dot(\\"S\\",S,S);dot(\\"Q\\",Q,S);dot(\\"R\\",R,N);dot(\\"P\\",P,S);draw(Q--S);draw(P--R);[/asy]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given that the sine of angle RPQ is 3/5, and angle RPQ and angle RPS are supplementary. I need to find the cosine of angle RPS. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There's a diagram with points R, P, Q, and S. P is at the origin, Q is on the positive x-axis, S is on the negative x-axis, and R is somewhere above P. So, angle RPQ is at point P between points R and Q, and angle RPS is at point P between points R and S. Since they are supplementary, that means angle RPQ plus angle RPS equals 180 degrees. So, if I know the sine of one angle, maybe I can find the cosine of the other. I remember that supplementary angles have some relationships in terms of sine and cosine. Specifically, I think that the sine of an angle is equal to the sine of its supplement, but the cosine is the negative of the cosine of its supplement. Let me verify that.So, if two angles are supplementary, say angle A and angle B, then angle A + angle B = 180 degrees. Then, sin(angle A) = sin(angle B) because sine is positive in both the first and second quadrants, and sin(180 - x) = sin x. On the other hand, cos(angle A) = -cos(angle B) because cosine is positive in the first quadrant and negative in the second quadrant, and cos(180 - x) = -cos x. Okay, so that means if sin(angle RPQ) is 3/5, then sin(angle RPS) is also 3/5. But I need cos(angle RPS). Since angle RPS is supplementary to angle RPQ, and angle RPQ is in the first quadrant (since R is above P and Q is on the positive x-axis), angle RPS must be in the second quadrant (since S is on the negative x-axis). In the second quadrant, cosine is negative. So, cos(angle RPS) will be negative.Now, I can use the Pythagorean identity to find cos(angle RPS). The identity is sin²x + cos²x = 1. So, if sin(angle RPS) is 3/5, then (3/5)² + cos²(angle RPS) = 1. Calculating that, (9/25) + cos²(angle RPS) = 1. Subtracting 9/25 from both sides, cos²(angle RPS) = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25. Taking the square root of both sides, cos(angle RPS) = ±4/5. But since angle RPS is in the second quadrant, cosine is negative there. Therefore, cos(angle RPS) = -4/5.Wait, let me double-check that. If angle RPQ is in the first quadrant, its sine is positive, which matches the given 3/5. Then, angle RPS is in the second quadrant, so its cosine should indeed be negative. Using the identity, I correctly found that the cosine is -4/5. Yeah, that makes sense.So, putting it all together, since angle RPQ and angle RPS are supplementary, and knowing that sin(angle RPQ) = 3/5, we can conclude that sin(angle RPS) is also 3/5. Using the Pythagorean identity, we find that cos(angle RPS) is -4/5 because it's in the second quadrant. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was remembering the properties of supplementary angles and the signs of sine and cosine in different quadrants. It's important to consider the quadrant when dealing with trigonometric functions because that determines the sign of the result.Another way to think about it is using the unit circle. If angle RPQ is in the first quadrant, its supplement angle RPS is in the second quadrant. On the unit circle, the x-coordinate (which corresponds to cosine) is negative in the second quadrant, while the y-coordinate (sine) remains positive. So, if the sine is 3/5, the cosine must be -4/5 to satisfy the Pythagorean identity.I guess another thing to consider is whether the triangle is right-angled or not. In this case, since we're dealing with angles at point P, and we have points R, Q, and S, it's likely that triangle RPQ is a right triangle or something similar. But since we're only given the sine of one angle and the relationship between two angles, we don't need to delve into the specifics of the triangle's sides beyond what's necessary for the trigonometric identities.Also, just to make sure, if I were to draw this out, point R is somewhere above the x-axis, making angle RPQ with the positive x-axis. Then, angle RPS would be the angle from the negative x-axis up to point R, forming a straight line with angle RPQ. So, together, they add up to 180 degrees, which is consistent with supplementary angles.In summary, the steps are:1. Recognize that supplementary angles have sines equal and cosines negatives of each other.2. Use the given sine value to find the cosine using the Pythagorean identity.3. Determine the sign of the cosine based on the quadrant of the angle.This problem reinforces the importance of understanding the unit circle and the properties of trigonometric functions in different quadrants. It's a good reminder to always consider the context of the angle's position when solving trigonometric problems.I think I'm confident with this solution. It all checks out logically and mathematically. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning. So, the cosine of angle RPS should be -4/5."},{"question":"If the two-digit number overline{ab} is greater than overline{cd} by 24, and the three-digit number overline{1ab} is 15 greater than overline{cd1}, what is overline{ad}?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the two-digit number (overline{ad}). The problem gives me two pieces of information:1. The two-digit number (overline{ab}) is greater than (overline{cd}) by 24.2. The three-digit number (overline{1ab}) is 15 greater than (overline{cd1}).Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I think I'll start by writing down what each of these numbers represents in terms of their digits.First, (overline{ab}) is a two-digit number, so it can be expressed as (10a + b), where (a) is the tens digit and (b) is the units digit. Similarly, (overline{cd}) is another two-digit number, which is (10c + d).The first condition says that (overline{ab}) is 24 more than (overline{cd}). So, mathematically, that would be:[10a + b = 10c + d + 24]Okay, got that equation down. Now, moving on to the second condition. The three-digit number (overline{1ab}) is 15 greater than (overline{cd1}). Let me parse this.(overline{1ab}) is a three-digit number where the hundreds digit is 1, the tens digit is (a), and the units digit is (b). So, that would be (100 times 1 + 10a + b = 100 + 10a + b).On the other hand, (overline{cd1}) is a three-digit number where the hundreds digit is (c), the tens digit is (d), and the units digit is 1. So, that would be (100c + 10d + 1).The second condition tells me that:[100 + 10a + b = 100c + 10d + 1 + 15]Simplifying the right side:[100 + 10a + b = 100c + 10d + 16]Hmm, okay. So now I have two equations:1. (10a + b = 10c + d + 24)2. (100 + 10a + b = 100c + 10d + 16)I need to solve these equations to find the values of (a), (b), (c), and (d). Once I have those, I can form the number (overline{ad}), which is (10a + d).Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find the values. Maybe I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate some variables.Wait, actually, let me look at the second equation again:[100 + 10a + b = 100c + 10d + 16]If I subtract 100 from both sides:[10a + b = 100c + 10d + 16 - 100]Which simplifies to:[10a + b = 100c + 10d - 84]But from the first equation, I know that (10a + b = 10c + d + 24). So, I can set these two expressions equal to each other:[10c + d + 24 = 100c + 10d - 84]Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange terms to solve for (c) and (d).Let me bring all terms to one side:[10c + d + 24 - 100c - 10d + 84 = 0]Simplifying:[-90c - 9d + 108 = 0]Divide the entire equation by -9 to simplify:[10c + d - 12 = 0]So:[10c + d = 12]Okay, so that's another equation: (10c + d = 12). Let me note that down.Now, going back to the first equation:[10a + b = 10c + d + 24]But from the equation I just found, (10c + d = 12), so substituting that in:[10a + b = 12 + 24]Which simplifies to:[10a + b = 36]So, (overline{ab}) is 36. That means (a = 3) and (b = 6), since 36 is a two-digit number where the tens digit is 3 and the units digit is 6.Alright, so now I know (a = 3) and (b = 6). Let's see if I can find (c) and (d) using the equation (10c + d = 12).Since (c) and (d) are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9. So, (10c + d = 12) implies that (c = 1) and (d = 2), because (10 times 1 + 2 = 12).Let me verify if these values satisfy the original conditions.First condition: (overline{ab} = 36) and (overline{cd} = 12). Is 36 greater than 12 by 24? Yes, because (36 - 12 = 24). That checks out.Second condition: (overline{1ab} = 136) and (overline{cd1} = 121). Is 136 greater than 121 by 15? Yes, because (136 - 121 = 15). That also checks out.Great, so (a = 3), (b = 6), (c = 1), and (d = 2). Now, the question asks for (overline{ad}), which is the two-digit number formed by (a) and (d).So, (overline{ad} = 10a + d = 10 times 3 + 2 = 30 + 2 = 32).Therefore, the answer is 32."},{"question":"Given an increasing geometric sequence {a_{n}} with a common ratio greater than 1 such that a_{2}+a_{4}=20, a_{3}=8.

It's increasing, and the common ratio is greater than 1. They give me two pieces of information: a₂ + a₄ equals 20, and a₃ equals 8. I need to find the general formula for the sequence and then compute this alternating sum involving products of consecutive terms.Okay, let's start with part (1). I know that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio, which I'll call q. So, a₁ is the first term, a₂ is a₁*q, a₃ is a₁*q², and so on. Given that a₃ is 8, that means a₁*q² = 8. So, I can write a₁ as 8 divided by q². That might be useful later.They also tell me that a₂ + a₄ = 20. Let's express those in terms of a₁ and q. a₂ is a₁*q, and a₄ is a₁*q³. So, adding those together: a₁*q + a₁*q³ = 20.Since I already have a₁ in terms of q, I can substitute that in. So, replacing a₁ with 8/q², I get (8/q²)*q + (8/q²)*q³ = 20. Let's simplify that.First term: (8/q²)*q is 8/q. Second term: (8/q²)*q³ is 8*q. So, the equation becomes 8/q + 8*q = 20.Hmm, okay, so 8/q + 8q = 20. Let me write that as 8q + 8/q = 20. Maybe I can factor out the 8? So, 8(q + 1/q) = 20. Dividing both sides by 8, I get q + 1/q = 20/8, which simplifies to q + 1/q = 2.5 or 5/2.So, q + 1/q = 5/2. Hmm, this is a quadratic in disguise. Let me set x = q, so the equation becomes x + 1/x = 5/2. Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator: x² + 1 = (5/2)x. Then, bring all terms to one side: x² - (5/2)x + 1 = 0.To make it easier, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x² - 5x + 2 = 0. Now, let's solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is x = [5 ± sqrt(25 - 16)] / 4, since the discriminant is b² - 4ac = 25 - 16 = 9.So, x = [5 ± 3]/4. That gives two solutions: (5 + 3)/4 = 8/4 = 2, and (5 - 3)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2. So, q could be 2 or 1/2.But wait, the problem says it's an increasing geometric sequence with a common ratio greater than 1. So, q must be greater than 1. Therefore, q = 2.Now that I have q = 2, I can find a₁. Earlier, I had a₁ = 8 / q². Plugging in q = 2, a₁ = 8 / 4 = 2.So, the first term is 2, and the common ratio is 2. Therefore, the general formula for the nth term is aₙ = a₁*q^(n-1) = 2*2^(n-1) = 2^n. So, aₙ = 2^n.Okay, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify with the given information. a₂ should be 2^2 = 4, a₃ is 8, a₄ is 16. Then, a₂ + a₄ is 4 + 16 = 20, which matches. And a₃ is 8, which is correct. So, part (1) is done.Now, moving on to part (2). I need to find the sum: a₁a₂ - a₂a₃ + a₃a₄ - ... + (-1)^(n-1)aₙaₙ₊₁.Let me write out the first few terms to see the pattern. The first term is a₁a₂, which is 2*4 = 8. Then, subtract a₂a₃: 4*8 = 32. So, 8 - 32. Then, add a₃a₄: 8*16 = 128. So, 8 - 32 + 128. Then, subtract a₄a₅: 16*32 = 512. So, 8 - 32 + 128 - 512, and so on.Wait, but the problem says up to (-1)^(n-1)aₙaₙ₊₁. So, depending on n, the number of terms changes. So, it's an alternating sum of products of consecutive terms.Let me denote this sum as S_n = a₁a₂ - a₂a₃ + a₃a₄ - ... + (-1)^(n-1)aₙaₙ₊₁.I need to find a general formula for S_n. Hmm, let's see.First, let's express each term aₖaₖ₊₁ in terms of n. Since aₖ = 2^k, then aₖaₖ₊₁ = 2^k * 2^(k+1) = 2^(2k + 1). So, each term is 2^(2k + 1).But with alternating signs: (-1)^(k-1)*2^(2k + 1). So, S_n = sum_{k=1}^n [(-1)^(k-1) * 2^(2k + 1)].Hmm, that seems like a geometric series with a common ratio. Let me see.Let me factor out the constants. 2^(2k + 1) is 2*4^k. So, S_n = 2 * sum_{k=1}^n [(-1)^(k-1) * 4^k].So, S_n = 2 * sum_{k=1}^n [(-4)^k * (-1)^(k-1)/(-1)^(k-1)] Wait, maybe another approach.Wait, (-1)^(k-1) * 4^k can be written as (-4)^k * (-1)^(-1) = (-4)^k * (-1). Wait, no, let's see:(-1)^(k-1) * 4^k = (-1)^(k-1) * (4)^k = (-1)^(k-1) * (4)^k.Alternatively, factor out a (-1):= (-1)^(k-1) * 4^k = (-1)^{k} * (-1)^{-1} * 4^k = (-1)^{k} * (-1) * 4^k = - (-4)^k.Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe another way.Let me write the sum as S_n = 2 * sum_{k=1}^n [(-1)^{k-1} * 4^k].Let me change the index to make it start from 0. Let m = k - 1. Then, when k=1, m=0, and when k=n, m=n-1.So, S_n = 2 * sum_{m=0}^{n-1} [(-1)^m * 4^{m+1}] = 2 * 4 * sum_{m=0}^{n-1} [(-4)^m].Ah, that's better. So, S_n = 8 * sum_{m=0}^{n-1} [(-4)^m].Now, that's a geometric series with first term 1, common ratio -4, and n terms.The sum of a geometric series is S = a1*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio.So, sum_{m=0}^{n-1} [(-4)^m] = (1 - (-4)^n)/(1 - (-4)) = (1 - (-4)^n)/5.Therefore, S_n = 8 * (1 - (-4)^n)/5 = (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^n).But wait, let's check the signs. The original sum was S_n = 8 - 32 + 128 - 512 + ... up to n terms.If n=1: S_1 = 8. Plugging into the formula: (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^1) = (8/5)*(1 +4) = (8/5)*5 = 8. Correct.n=2: S_2 = 8 - 32 = -24. Formula: (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^2) = (8/5)*(1 - 16) = (8/5)*(-15) = -24. Correct.n=3: S_3 = 8 -32 +128 = 104. Formula: (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^3) = (8/5)*(1 +64) = (8/5)*65 = 104. Correct.n=4: S_4 = 8 -32 +128 -512 = -408. Formula: (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^4) = (8/5)*(1 -256) = (8/5)*(-255) = -408. Correct.So, the formula seems to work.But wait, in the formula, it's (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^n). But in the problem, the last term is (-1)^(n-1)aₙaₙ₊₁. Let me check if the formula aligns with that.When n=1: last term is (-1)^0 a₁a₂ = 8. Formula gives 8.When n=2: last term is (-1)^1 a₂a₃ = -32. Formula gives -24, which is 8 -32.Wait, but the formula is S_n = (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^n). So, for n=2, it's (8/5)*(1 - 16) = -24, which is 8 -32. Correct.Similarly, for n=3: (8/5)*(1 - (-64)) = (8/5)*(65) = 104, which is 8 -32 +128. Correct.So, yes, the formula is correct.But let me express it in terms of 2^(2n+1). Wait, (-4)^n is (2^2)^n = 2^(2n). So, (-4)^n = (-1)^n * 2^(2n).Therefore, S_n = (8/5)*(1 - (-1)^n * 2^(2n)).Alternatively, factoring out the 8/5, it's 8/5 - (8/5)*(-1)^n *2^(2n).But 8 is 2^3, and 2^(2n) is 4^n. So, 8*4^n is 2^(3+2n) = 2^(2n+3).Wait, 8*4^n = 2^3*(2^2)^n = 2^(3+2n) = 2^(2n+3). So, 8*4^n = 2^(2n+3).Therefore, S_n = (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^n) = (8/5) - (8/5)*(-4)^n = (8/5) - (-1)^n*(8*4^n)/5 = (8/5) - (-1)^n*(2^(2n+3))/5.So, S_n = (8/5) - (-1)^n*(2^(2n+3))/5.Alternatively, factoring out 8/5, it's (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^n).But the problem asks for the sum up to (-1)^(n-1)aₙaₙ₊₁. Let me check if my formula aligns with that.Yes, because when I expressed S_n as sum_{k=1}^n [(-1)^(k-1) * 2^(2k + 1)], which is equivalent to the given sum.So, the final formula is S_n = (8/5) - (-1)^n*(2^(2n+3))/5.Alternatively, factoring out 8/5, it's (8/5)*(1 - (-4)^n).But to write it in terms of 2's exponents, it's better to write it as (8/5) - (-1)^n*(2^(2n+3))/5.So, that's the answer for part (2).Let me just recap:Part (1): The general term is aₙ = 2^n.Part (2): The sum S_n = (8/5) - (-1)^n*(2^(2n+3))/5.I think that's it. Let me double-check with n=1,2,3,4 to make sure.n=1: S₁=8. Formula: (8/5) - (-1)^1*(2^(2*1+3))/5 = (8/5) - (-1)*(32)/5 = 8/5 +32/5=40/5=8. Correct.n=2: S₂=8-32=-24. Formula: (8/5) - (-1)^2*(2^(2*2+3))/5 = (8/5) - (1)*(128)/5= (8 -128)/5= (-120)/5=-24. Correct.n=3: S₃=8-32+128=104. Formula: (8/5) - (-1)^3*(2^(2*3+3))/5= (8/5) - (-1)*(512)/5=8/5 +512/5=520/5=104. Correct.n=4: S₄=8-32+128-512=-408. Formula: (8/5) - (-1)^4*(2^(2*4+3))/5= (8/5) - (1)*(2048)/5= (8 -2048)/5= (-2040)/5=-408. Correct.So, the formula works for these cases. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct."},{"question":"Given the sets M={-1, 1, 2} and N={x|x<1}, find M cap N.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the intersection of two sets, M and N. Let me first make sure I understand what each set is.Set M is given as {-1, 1, 2}. That's straightforward—it's just three numbers: negative one, one, and two. So, M = {-1, 1, 2}.Now, set N is defined as {x | x < 1}. Hmm, okay. So, N is a set of all real numbers x such that x is less than 1. That means N includes every number that's to the left of 1 on the number line. So, numbers like 0, -1, -2, 0.5, -0.3, and so on are all in N. It's an infinite set because there are infinitely many numbers less than 1.The question asks for M ∩ N. Intersection of two sets means all the elements that are common to both sets. So, I need to find which elements are in both M and N.Let me list out the elements of M again: -1, 1, and 2. Now, I need to check each of these to see if they are also in N.Starting with -1: Is -1 less than 1? Yes, because -1 is to the left of 1 on the number line. So, -1 is in N.Next, 1: Is 1 less than 1? No, because 1 is equal to 1, not less than. So, 1 is not in N.Then, 2: Is 2 less than 1? Definitely not, since 2 is to the right of 1 on the number line. So, 2 is not in N.So, out of all the elements in M, only -1 is also in N. Therefore, the intersection of M and N should be {-1}.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. M has three elements, and N is all numbers less than 1. So, only -1 is less than 1 in M. The other elements, 1 and 2, are not less than 1, so they don't belong to N. Therefore, the intersection is just {-1}.I think that's correct. I don't see any other elements in M that would satisfy the condition x < 1. So, yeah, M ∩ N is {-1}."},{"question":"Let m be the minimum number of circles of radius 1 required to cover a convex polygon M, and n be the maximum number of circles with a diameter of 1 that can be arranged such that no two circles overlap and all their centers belong to the polygon M. Which number is greater, -m or n?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about covering a convex polygon with circles. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, the problem defines two numbers: m and n. - m is the minimum number of circles with radius 1 needed to cover the convex polygon M.- n is the maximum number of circles with diameter 1 that can be arranged inside M such that none of them overlap, and all their centers are within M.The question is asking which number is greater: -m or n. Hmm, that's interesting because one is negative and the other is positive, but I think the question is more about comparing the magnitudes of m and n rather than their signs. Maybe it's a trick question? Or perhaps it's just a way to compare m and n indirectly.Let me think about what m and n represent. Starting with m: it's the minimum number of circles of radius 1 needed to cover the polygon M. So, if I imagine the polygon, I need to place as few circles as possible, each with radius 1, such that every point in the polygon is within at least one circle. This is a covering problem, and m is the smallest number of such circles.On the other hand, n is the maximum number of circles with diameter 1 that can be placed inside M without overlapping, and all their centers must be within M. So, these circles are smaller—diameter 1 means radius 0.5. They can't overlap, so the distance between any two centers must be at least 1 (since each has a radius of 0.5, the centers need to be at least 1 unit apart to prevent overlapping). Now, the question is comparing -m and n. Since m is a positive integer (number of circles), -m is negative. n is also a positive integer, as it's the number of circles. So, comparing a negative number and a positive number, the positive number is always greater. But I feel like this might not be the intended interpretation because the problem seems more involved.Wait, maybe the question is asking whether m is greater than n or n is greater than m, but phrased as comparing -m and n. If that's the case, then if m is less than n, -m would be greater than n only if n is negative, which it's not. Hmm, this is confusing.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking which is greater in magnitude: m or n. But without knowing the specific values, it's hard to say. Maybe there's a relationship between m and n that can be deduced.Let me think about the relationship between covering and packing. Covering involves placing circles to cover the entire area, while packing involves placing as many circles as possible without overlapping. These are dual problems in some sense.If I have a convex polygon M, the number of circles needed to cover it (m) would depend on the size and shape of M. Similarly, the number of circles that can be packed inside M without overlapping (n) also depends on the size and shape of M.But how do these two numbers relate? Is there a general relationship between the covering number and the packing number for a convex polygon?I recall that in packing problems, the maximum number of non-overlapping circles that can fit inside a shape is related to the area of the shape divided by the area of a circle. Similarly, for covering, the minimum number of circles needed to cover a shape is also related to the area, but it's a bit more complex because of the geometry involved.Let me try to formalize this a bit. For packing:- Each circle has diameter 1, so radius 0.5.- The area of each circle is π*(0.5)^2 = π/4.- The maximum number of such circles that can fit inside M without overlapping is n.- So, the area of M must be at least n*(π/4). Therefore, n ≤ Area(M)/(π/4) = 4*Area(M)/π.For covering:- Each circle has radius 1.- The area of each circle is π*(1)^2 = π.- The minimum number of such circles needed to cover M is m.- So, the area of M must be at most m*π. Therefore, m ≥ Area(M)/π.Now, comparing the two:- From packing: n ≤ 4*Area(M)/π- From covering: m ≥ Area(M)/πSo, if I combine these, I get m ≥ Area(M)/π and n ≤ 4*Area(M)/π. Therefore, n ≤ 4*Area(M)/π ≤ 4m.Wait, that gives n ≤ 4m, which suggests that n is at most four times m. But that doesn't directly answer whether m is greater than n or vice versa.Alternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. If I have n circles of diameter 1 packed inside M, their centers are all within M, and they don't overlap. If I expand each of these circles to radius 1, would they cover M?Let me visualize this. If I have a circle of diameter 1, its radius is 0.5. If I expand it to radius 1, it becomes a circle that's twice as large. So, each original circle of diameter 1, when expanded, would cover a larger area.But would these expanded circles cover the entire polygon M? Not necessarily, because the original centers were chosen such that the small circles don't overlap, but expanding them might not cover the entire area, especially near the edges of M.Alternatively, if I consider that m is the minimum number of radius 1 circles needed to cover M, and n is the maximum number of diameter 1 circles that can be packed inside M, then m and n are related but not directly comparable without more information.Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate m and n by considering that each circle in the packing can be associated with a circle in the covering. If I have n circles packed inside M, each with diameter 1, then if I place a circle of radius 1 at each of these centers, would that cover M?Not necessarily, because the original packing circles are only of diameter 1, so their centers are at least 1 unit apart. But the covering circles have radius 1, so they would overlap with each other. However, the key point is whether these expanded circles cover the entire polygon.If the original packing circles are arranged such that their centers are spread out, expanding them to radius 1 might indeed cover the entire polygon. But I'm not sure if that's always the case.Alternatively, maybe the number of covering circles m is less than or equal to the number of packing circles n because each packing circle, when expanded, can cover a region that might overlap with others, potentially reducing the total number needed for covering.But I'm not entirely confident about this line of reasoning.Let me try a different approach. Suppose I have a square polygon for simplicity. Let's say it's a square with side length s.For packing:- The maximum number of circles of diameter 1 that can fit inside the square is roughly (s/1)^2, assuming s is much larger than 1. So, n ≈ s^2.For covering:- The minimum number of circles of radius 1 needed to cover the square would be roughly (s/2)^2, since each circle covers a 2x2 area. So, m ≈ (s/2)^2.Comparing these, n ≈ s^2 and m ≈ s^2/4, so n is approximately four times m. Therefore, in this case, n is greater than m.But wait, this is just for a square. What about other convex polygons?If I consider a very long and thin convex polygon, like a rectangle with length L and width w, where L is much larger than w.For packing:- The number of circles of diameter 1 that can fit along the length is roughly L/1 = L.- Along the width, since w is small, maybe only 1 circle can fit.- So, n ≈ L.For covering:- The number of circles of radius 1 needed to cover the length would be roughly L/2, since each circle covers 2 units.- Along the width, since w is small, maybe only 1 circle is needed.- So, m ≈ L/2.Again, n ≈ L and m ≈ L/2, so n is greater than m.Hmm, in both cases, n seems to be greater than m. Is this always true?Wait, let's think about a circle itself. If M is a circle of radius R.For packing:- The maximum number of circles of diameter 1 that can fit inside a circle of radius R is roughly the area of M divided by the area of a small circle: πR^2 / (π*(0.5)^2) = 4R^2.For covering:- The minimum number of circles of radius 1 needed to cover M would depend on R. If R is large, it's roughly the same as the packing number, but if R is small, it might be less.Wait, if M is a circle of radius R, then the number of circles of radius 1 needed to cover it would be roughly the same as the number needed to cover a disk of radius R with disks of radius 1. This is a classic covering problem.The covering density for circles is known, but I don't remember the exact formula. However, generally, the number of circles needed to cover a larger circle is proportional to the area, similar to packing.But in this case, if M is a circle of radius R, then n ≈ 4R^2 and m would also be roughly proportional to R^2, but with a different constant.But without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard to say whether m is greater or less than n.Wait, but in the previous examples, n was greater than m. Maybe in general, n is greater than m.But I need to think more carefully.Let me consider the definitions again.m is the minimum number of circles of radius 1 to cover M.n is the maximum number of circles of diameter 1 that can be packed inside M without overlapping, with centers in M.Now, if I have n circles of diameter 1 packed inside M, their centers are all within M, and they don't overlap. If I expand each of these circles to radius 1, what happens?Each original circle of diameter 1 has radius 0.5. Expanding it to radius 1 means each circle now has double the radius. So, the distance between any two centers was at least 1 (to prevent overlapping of the small circles), but after expanding, the distance between centers is still at least 1, but the circles now have radius 1, so they will overlap.Wait, if two circles of radius 1 have centers at least 1 unit apart, do they overlap? Let's see: the distance between centers is d. If d < 2*radius, which is 2*1=2, then they overlap. Since d ≥ 1, which is less than 2, so yes, they would overlap.Therefore, expanding the packing circles to covering circles would result in overlapping circles. But does this covering still cover the entire polygon M?Not necessarily, because the original packing circles were placed in such a way that their centers are spread out, but expanding them might leave gaps near the edges of M.Alternatively, maybe the expanded circles do cover M. If the original packing circles are arranged such that their centers are spread throughout M, then expanding them to radius 1 might cover M entirely.But I'm not sure. It might depend on the specific shape of M.Wait, but if I have n circles of diameter 1 packed inside M, and I expand each to radius 1, then the union of these expanded circles would cover M if and only if every point in M is within 1 unit of at least one center.But the original packing circles have centers within M, but their coverage is only up to 0.5 units from the center. Expanding to 1 unit would cover more, but does it necessarily cover all of M?I think not necessarily. For example, consider a polygon M that is a long, thin rectangle. If I pack circles of diameter 1 along the length, their centers are spaced 1 unit apart. Expanding each to radius 1 would cover a band around each center, but near the ends of the rectangle, there might still be uncovered areas.Alternatively, if M is a square, and I pack circles of diameter 1 in a grid pattern, expanding each to radius 1 would cover the entire square because the distance from any point in the square to the nearest center would be at most sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707, which is less than 1. So in that case, expanding would cover the entire square.Hmm, so in some cases, expanding the packing circles to covering circles would cover M, and in others, it might not.But regardless, if expanding the packing circles to covering circles covers M, then the number of covering circles m would be less than or equal to n, because n circles are sufficient to cover M when expanded. But if expanding doesn't cover M, then m would be greater than n.But I don't know if expanding always covers M or not.Wait, let's think about it differently. If I have n circles of diameter 1 packed inside M, then the distance from any point in M to the nearest center is at most 0.5, because the circles are packed without overlapping and their centers are spread out.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. The distance from a point in M to the nearest center could be greater than 0.5 if the point is near the edge of M and far from any center.But in reality, the maximum distance from any point in M to the nearest center in the packing would depend on the arrangement of the centers.If the packing is optimal, then the maximum distance from any point in M to the nearest center is minimized. But I don't know if that maximum distance is less than or equal to 1.Wait, if the packing is such that the centers are spread out with a minimum distance of 1 between any two centers, then the maximum distance from any point in M to the nearest center would be at most sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, assuming an optimal packing in a hexagonal grid.But in a convex polygon, the packing might not be perfectly hexagonal, but still, the maximum distance from any point to the nearest center would be less than or equal to 1.Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, in a long, thin rectangle, the centers are spaced 1 unit apart along the length, but the width is less than 1, so the maximum distance from a point to the nearest center could be up to 0.5 in the width direction, but along the length, it could be up to 0.5 from the ends.But if the length is much larger than 1, then the maximum distance from any point to the nearest center would still be less than or equal to 0.5.Wait, no, if the centers are spaced 1 unit apart along the length, then between two centers, the maximum distance to the nearest center is 0.5 units.So, in that case, the maximum distance from any point in M to the nearest center is 0.5 units.Therefore, if I expand each packing circle to radius 1, then every point in M would be within 0.5 units of a center, and since the expanded circles have radius 1, which is more than enough to cover the entire M.Wait, that seems to make sense. If the maximum distance from any point in M to the nearest center is 0.5, then expanding the circles to radius 1 would definitely cover M, because 0.5 + 1 = 1.5, which is more than enough to cover the entire M.But wait, actually, the distance from the point to the center is 0.5, and the radius of the expanded circle is 1, so the point is within 0.5 units of the center, which is well within the radius of 1. So yes, expanding the packing circles to radius 1 would cover M.Therefore, if I have n circles of diameter 1 packed inside M, expanding them to radius 1 would cover M. Therefore, n circles of radius 1 are sufficient to cover M, which means that the minimum number of circles needed to cover M, which is m, must be less than or equal to n.So, m ≤ n.Therefore, n is greater than or equal to m.But the question is asking which is greater: -m or n. Since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater.Wait, but I think the question is actually asking whether m is greater than n or n is greater than m, but phrased as comparing -m and n. If that's the case, then since m ≤ n, then -m ≥ -n, but n is positive, so n is greater than -m.But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking whether m is greater than n or n is greater than m, and it's phrased as comparing -m and n to see which is greater. In that case, since m ≤ n, then -m ≥ -n, but n is positive, so n is greater than -m.But I think the key point is that m ≤ n, so n is greater than or equal to m.Therefore, the answer is that n is greater than or equal to m.But the question is phrased as \\"Which number is greater, -m or n?\\" So, since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater.But I think the intended answer is that n is greater than m, so n is greater than -m.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should re-examine the problem.Wait, the problem says:\\"Let m be the minimum number of circles of radius 1 required to cover a convex polygon M, and n be the maximum number of circles with a diameter of 1 that can be arranged such that no two circles overlap and all their centers belong to the polygon M. Which number is greater, -m or n?\\"So, it's asking which is greater: -m or n. Since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater.But maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking about the relationship between m and n, and then comparing their magnitudes. If m ≤ n, then |m| ≤ |n|, but since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater.Alternatively, if m ≤ n, then -m ≥ -n, but since n is positive, n is greater than -m.So, in any case, n is greater than -m.But I think the key point is that m ≤ n, so n is greater than m, and since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater.Therefore, the answer is that n is greater than -m.But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Maybe I should look for a more formal proof.Let me try to formalize the argument.1. Let M be a convex polygon.2. Let m be the minimum number of circles of radius 1 needed to cover M.3. Let n be the maximum number of circles of diameter 1 that can be packed inside M without overlapping, with centers in M.4. Consider the n circles of diameter 1 packed inside M. Their centers are all within M, and the distance between any two centers is at least 1.5. If we expand each of these n circles to radius 1, the resulting circles will have a radius of 1 and centers within M.6. Since the original centers were at least 1 unit apart, expanding to radius 1 will cause these circles to overlap.7. However, the union of these expanded circles will cover M because any point in M is within 0.5 units of a center (since the original packing ensures that), and expanding to radius 1 ensures that all points within 0.5 units are covered.8. Therefore, n circles of radius 1 are sufficient to cover M, which implies that m ≤ n.9. Since m ≤ n, and n is positive while -m is negative, n is greater than -m.Therefore, the answer is that n is greater than -m.But I think the intended answer is that n is greater than m, but phrased as comparing -m and n, so n is greater.Alternatively, if the question is asking whether m is greater than n or n is greater than m, then n is greater.But the question specifically asks \\"Which number is greater, -m or n?\\" So, since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater.But I think the key insight is that m ≤ n, so n is greater than m, and since n is positive and -m is negative, n is greater than -m.Therefore, the answer is that n is greater than -m."},{"question":"In the same plane, there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.A: ParallelB: PerpendicularC: Parallel and equalD: Either perpendicular or parallel","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: \\"In the same plane, there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.\\" The options are A: Parallel, B: Perpendicular, C: Parallel and equal, D: Either perpendicular or parallel. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.First, let me recall what I know about lines in a plane. I remember that two lines can be parallel, meaning they never intersect, or they can intersect at a point. If they intersect at a right angle, they are perpendicular. Also, there's something about the uniqueness of such lines passing through a given point.So, the question is asking about the existence and uniqueness of a line passing through a specific point relative to a known line. It mentions \\"exactly one line,\\" so it's about whether such a line is unique in being either parallel or perpendicular.Let me think about parallel lines first. In a plane, given a line and a point not on that line, there is exactly one line that can pass through that point and be parallel to the given line. That's the parallel postulate, right? So, for parallel lines, there is exactly one such line.Now, what about perpendicular lines? Similarly, given a line and a point, is there exactly one line that can pass through that point and be perpendicular to the given line? I think so. If you have a line and a point, you can draw only one line through that point that forms a right angle with the given line. So, that would also be unique.Wait, so both parallel and perpendicular lines have exactly one line that can pass through a given point relative to a known line. But the question is asking which one is it. The options are A: Parallel, B: Perpendicular, C: Parallel and equal, D: Either perpendicular or parallel.Hmm, so option D says \\"Either perpendicular or parallel,\\" meaning that depending on the situation, it could be either, but in each case, there's exactly one line. But the question is phrased as \\"there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.\\" So it's asking for what property that line has, not whether it's one or the other.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back. The question is asking for the property of the line that passes through the given point relative to the known line, and it's exactly one such line. So, if it's asking for the property, it's either parallel or perpendicular.But the options are A: Parallel, B: Perpendicular, C: Parallel and equal, D: Either perpendicular or parallel.So, is it that the line can be either parallel or perpendicular, but not necessarily both? Or is it that it's exactly one line, which could be either, depending on the point?Wait, no. The question is saying that in the same plane, there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line. So, it's not saying that for any given point, it can be either, but rather, for a given point and a known line, there is exactly one line that can pass through the point and have a certain relationship to the known line.So, if the relationship is parallel, then there is exactly one such line. If the relationship is perpendicular, there is exactly one such line. So, depending on what the blank is, the answer could be A or B. But the question is asking for which one is it.Wait, but the options are A: Parallel, B: Perpendicular, C: Parallel and equal, D: Either perpendicular or parallel.So, if I think about the properties, given a point and a line, there is exactly one line through the point that is parallel to the given line, and exactly one line through the point that is perpendicular to the given line. So, depending on what you're looking for, it could be either.But the question is phrased as \\"there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.\\" So, it's not saying that it's either/or, but rather, what is the property that such a line has, knowing that there is exactly one.Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read it again: \\"In the same plane, there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.\\" So, it's saying that for a given point and a known line, there is exactly one line through the point that is either parallel or perpendicular.But the options are A: Parallel, B: Perpendicular, C: Parallel and equal, D: Either perpendicular or parallel.So, if it's saying that there is exactly one line that can pass through the point and be either parallel or perpendicular, then the correct answer would be D: Either perpendicular or parallel.But wait, no, because the question is asking for the blank. It's saying \\"be (　　) to a known line.\\" So, it's not saying that it's either/or, but rather, what is the property that the line has, knowing that there is exactly one such line.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it this way: If the blank is \\"parallel,\\" then the statement is \\"there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be parallel to a known line.\\" That's true. Similarly, if the blank is \\"perpendicular,\\" then the statement is also true.But the question is asking which one is correct. So, is it that both A and B are correct? But the options are single choices. So, maybe the answer is D: Either perpendicular or parallel, because depending on the point, it could be either.Wait, no, because the question is about the property of the line, not about the point. It's saying that for a given point and a known line, there is exactly one line through the point that is either parallel or perpendicular.But the options are A: Parallel, B: Perpendicular, C: Parallel and equal, D: Either perpendicular or parallel.So, if the blank is \\"either perpendicular or parallel,\\" then the statement would be \\"there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be either perpendicular or parallel to a known line.\\" But that doesn't make sense because for a given point and line, there is exactly one line that is parallel, and exactly one that is perpendicular. So, if you consider both, there are two lines, but the question says \\"exactly one line.\\"Wait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I need to think about the wording again.\\"In the same plane, there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.\\"So, it's saying that for a given point and a known line, there is exactly one line through the point that has a certain relationship to the known line.

It states that given a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one line through the point that is parallel to the given line. Similarly, for perpendicular lines, given a line and a point, there is exactly one line through the point that is perpendicular to the given line.So, both parallel and perpendicular lines have this uniqueness property. Therefore, the statement is true whether the blank is \\"parallel\\" or \\"perpendicular.\\" So, if the options allow for both, then D would be the answer. But since the options are single choices, maybe the question is implying that the line can be either, but in reality, it's both.Wait, I'm getting myself in circles. Maybe I should look at the options again.A: ParallelB: PerpendicularC: Parallel and equalD: Either perpendicular or parallelSo, if I think about it, the question is asking for the property that the line has, knowing that there is exactly one such line. So, if the property is \\"parallel,\\" then it's true. If it's \\"perpendicular,\\" it's also true. So, the correct answer would be both A and B, but since that's not an option, D is the closest, meaning that it can be either, depending on the situation.But wait, the question is not saying \\"either/or,\\" it's saying \\"there is exactly one line that can pass through a given point and be (　　) to a known line.\\" So, it's not that it can be either, but rather, what is the property that such a line has, knowing that there is exactly one.Wait, maybe the answer is both A and B, but since that's not an option, I'm confused.Alternatively, maybe the answer is B: Perpendicular, because the question is about the uniqueness of the perpendicular line, but I'm not sure.Wait, let me think of it this way: If the blank is \\"parallel,\\" then the statement is true.

So, both A and B are correct, but since the options don't allow for multiple answers, perhaps D is the intended answer, meaning that it can be either.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should go with D: Either perpendicular or parallel, because both are possible, and the question is about the uniqueness of such a line, which applies to both cases.Wait, but the question is asking for the property that the line has, not whether it can be either. So, maybe the answer is both A and B, but since that's not an option, perhaps D is the best choice.Alternatively, maybe the answer is B: Perpendicular, because the question is about the uniqueness of the perpendicular line, but I'm not certain.Wait, I think I need to make a decision here. Given that both parallel and perpendicular lines have the uniqueness property, and the question is asking for what the line can be, I think the answer is D: Either perpendicular or parallel.But I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should look up the exact statement.Wait, I recall that the parallel postulate states that through a point not on a line, there is exactly one parallel line. Similarly, for perpendicular lines, through any point, there is exactly one perpendicular line to a given line. So, both are unique. Therefore, the statement is true for both parallel and perpendicular lines.So, if the question is asking what the line can be, knowing that there is exactly one, then it's either parallel or perpendicular. Therefore, the answer is D.Yeah, I think that's it. So, the correct answer is D: Either perpendicular or parallel."},{"question":"Calculate the value of C_{n}^{1} + 2^2C_{n}^{2} + 3^2C_{n}^{3} + … + n^2C_{n}^{n}2^{n}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: Calculate the value of ( C_{n}^{1} + 2^2C_{n}^{2} + 3^2C_{n}^{3} + dots + n^2C_{n}^{n}2^{n} ). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down.First, I recognize that ( C_{n}^{k} ) is the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose ( k ) elements from a set of ( n ) elements. So, ( C_{n}^{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} ). That part I'm familiar with.Looking at the expression, it's a sum where each term is ( k^2 ) multiplied by ( C_{n}^{k} ) and then multiplied by ( 2^k ). Wait, actually, the problem is written as ( C_{n}^{1} + 2^2C_{n}^{2} + 3^2C_{n}^{3} + dots + n^2C_{n}^{n}2^{n} ). So, each term is ( k^2C_{n}^{k}2^{k} ), right? So, the general term is ( k^2C_{n}^{k}2^{k} ).So, the sum is ( sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}2^{k} ). That's the expression we need to evaluate.I remember that for sums involving binomial coefficients, generating functions or differentiation techniques can be useful. Let me recall some relevant formulas.I know that the binomial theorem states that ( (1 + x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} C_{n}^{k}x^{k} ). Also, there are formulas for sums involving ( kC_{n}^{k} ) and ( k^2C_{n}^{k} ). Maybe I can use those.Wait, the problem has ( k^2C_{n}^{k}2^{k} ). So, it's similar to the sum ( sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}x^{k} ) evaluated at ( x = 2 ). But in the problem, the sum starts at ( k=1 ), which is fine because the ( k=0 ) term would be zero anyway.So, if I can find a general expression for ( sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}x^{k} ), then I can substitute ( x = 2 ) to get the desired sum.Let me recall how to find such sums. I remember that for ( sum_{k=0}^{n} kC_{n}^{k}x^{k} ), we can differentiate the binomial theorem. Similarly, for ( sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}x^{k} ), we might need to differentiate twice.Let me try that approach.First, start with the binomial theorem:( (1 + x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} C_{n}^{k}x^{k} ).Differentiate both sides with respect to ( x ):( n(1 + x)^{n-1} = sum_{k=0}^{n} kC_{n}^{k}x^{k-1} ).Multiply both sides by ( x ):( nx(1 + x)^{n-1} = sum_{k=0}^{n} kC_{n}^{k}x^{k} ).That gives us the sum ( sum_{k=0}^{n} kC_{n}^{k}x^{k} = nx(1 + x)^{n-1} ).Now, to get the sum involving ( k^2 ), we can differentiate again.Differentiate both sides of ( nx(1 + x)^{n-1} ) with respect to ( x ):First, let me denote ( S = nx(1 + x)^{n-1} ).Differentiate ( S ) with respect to ( x ):( S' = n(1 + x)^{n-1} + nx(n - 1)(1 + x)^{n-2} ).Simplify:( S' = n(1 + x)^{n-1} + n(n - 1)x(1 + x)^{n-2} ).Factor out ( n(1 + x)^{n-2} ):( S' = n(1 + x)^{n-2} [ (1 + x) + (n - 1)x ] ).Simplify inside the brackets:( (1 + x) + (n - 1)x = 1 + x + nx - x = 1 + nx ).So, ( S' = n(1 + x)^{n-2}(1 + nx) ).But ( S' ) is also equal to the derivative of ( sum_{k=0}^{n} kC_{n}^{k}x^{k} ), which is ( sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}x^{k-1} ).Multiply both sides by ( x ) to get the sum with ( x^{k} ):( xS' = sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}x^{k} ).So, substituting our expression for ( S' ):( xS' = nx(1 + x)^{n-2}(1 + nx) ).Therefore, the sum ( sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}x^{k} = nx(1 + x)^{n-2}(1 + nx) ).Now, in our problem, we need to evaluate this sum at ( x = 2 ). So, substitute ( x = 2 ):( sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2C_{n}^{k}2^{k} = n cdot 2 cdot (1 + 2)^{n-2} cdot (1 + n cdot 2) ).Simplify each part:First, ( n cdot 2 = 2n ).Next, ( (1 + 2)^{n-2} = 3^{n-2} ).Then, ( (1 + 2n) ) remains as is.So, putting it all together:( 2n cdot 3^{n-2} cdot (1 + 2n) ).Simplify further:( 2n(2n + 1)3^{n-2} ).Alternatively, we can write this as ( 2n(2n + 1)3^{n-2} ).But let me check if this makes sense. When ( n = 1 ), the sum should be ( 1^2C_{1}^{1}2^{1} = 1 cdot 1 cdot 2 = 2 ).Plugging ( n = 1 ) into our formula: ( 2 cdot 1 cdot (2 cdot 1 + 1)3^{1-2} = 2 cdot 1 cdot 3 cdot 3^{-1} = 2 cdot 1 cdot 3 cdot frac{1}{3} = 2 ). That matches.Another test case: ( n = 2 ).The sum is ( C_{2}^{1}2^{1} + 2^2C_{2}^{2}2^{2} = 2 cdot 2 + 4 cdot 1 cdot 4 = 4 + 16 = 20 ).Using our formula: ( 2 cdot 2 cdot (2 cdot 2 + 1)3^{2-2} = 4 cdot 5 cdot 1 = 20 ). That also matches.Another test: ( n = 3 ).Sum: ( C_{3}^{1}2^{1} + 2^2C_{3}^{2}2^{2} + 3^2C_{3}^{3}2^{3} ).Calculate each term:- ( C_{3}^{1}2^{1} = 3 cdot 2 = 6 )- ( 4 cdot C_{3}^{2} cdot 4 = 4 cdot 3 cdot 4 = 48 )- ( 9 cdot C_{3}^{3} cdot 8 = 9 cdot 1 cdot 8 = 72 )Total sum: ( 6 + 48 + 72 = 126 ).Using our formula: ( 2 cdot 3 cdot (2 cdot 3 + 1)3^{3-2} = 6 cdot 7 cdot 3 = 6 cdot 21 = 126 ). Perfect, matches again.So, the formula seems correct.Therefore, the value of the given sum is ( 2n(2n + 1)3^{n-2} ).Alternatively, we can factor this differently, but this seems like a concise form.So, the final answer is ( 2n(2n + 1)3^{n-2} )."},{"question":"As shown in Figure 1, in the regular triangular prism (ABC-A_1B_1C_1), (D) and (E) are points on the lateral edges (BB_1) and (CC_1), respectively. Given that (EC = BC = 2BD), find the measure of the dihedral angle between the section (ADE) and the base (ABC).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular triangular prism, (ABC-A_1B_1C_1). Points (D) and (E) are on the lateral edges (BB_1) and (CC_1), respectively. The condition given is that (EC = BC = 2BD). I need to find the measure of the dihedral angle between the section (ADE) and the base (ABC).First, let me try to visualize the prism. A regular triangular prism has two congruent equilateral triangles as its bases and three rectangles as its lateral faces. So, (ABC) and (A_1B_1C_1) are equilateral triangles, and (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1) are the lateral edges.Points (D) and (E) are on (BB_1) and (CC_1), respectively. The condition (EC = BC = 2BD) tells me something about the lengths of these segments. Since (BC) is a side of the equilateral triangle, its length is equal to the side length of the base. Let me denote the side length as (s). So, (BC = s), which means (EC = s) as well. Also, (BD = frac{s}{2}) because (EC = 2BD).Wait, hold on. If (EC = BC = s), then (E) must be a point on (CC_1) such that the length from (C) to (E) is equal to the side length of the base. But (CC_1) is a lateral edge, so its length is the height of the prism. Hmm, in a regular triangular prism, the lateral edges are perpendicular to the base, so the height of the prism is equal to the length of (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1). But the problem doesn't specify the height, so I might need to assign a variable to it or assume it's equal to the side length? Wait, no, in a regular triangular prism, the lateral edges are equal in length, but they can be different from the base edges. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.Wait, actually, in a regular triangular prism, the bases are regular triangles, but the lateral edges can be of any length. However, sometimes \\"regular\\" can imply that the lateral edges are equal to the base edges, making it a uniform prism. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed without assuming that and see if the problem gives more information.Given that (EC = BC = 2BD), let me denote (BD = x). Then, (EC = 2x), and since (EC = BC), that means (BC = 2x). But (BC) is a side of the base triangle (ABC), so if I let (BC = s), then (s = 2x), so (x = frac{s}{2}). Therefore, (BD = frac{s}{2}) and (EC = s).So, point (D) is the midpoint of (BB_1) because (BD = frac{s}{2}), assuming that (BB_1) has length (s). Wait, but is (BB_1) equal to (s)? If the prism is regular, then yes, the lateral edges are equal to the base edges. So, (BB_1 = AA_1 = CC_1 = s). Therefore, (BD = frac{s}{2}), so (D) is the midpoint of (BB_1). Similarly, (EC = s), so since (CC_1 = s), point (E) must coincide with (C_1), because (EC = s) and (CC_1 = s). Wait, that can't be right because (E) is on (CC_1), so if (EC = s), then (E) is at (C_1). Hmm, but then (E) would be the upper vertex, which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the prism's height is different.Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. If (EC = BC), and (BC = s), then (EC = s). But (CC_1) is a lateral edge, so its length is the height of the prism, let's denote it as (h). So, if (EC = s), then (h) must be greater than or equal to (s), because (E) is somewhere along (CC_1). So, (EC = s) implies that (E) is a point on (CC_1) such that the distance from (C) to (E) is (s). Therefore, if (CC_1 = h), then (E) divides (CC_1) into segments (CE = s) and (EE_1 = h - s). But since (E) is on (CC_1), (h) must be greater than or equal to (s). Hmm, but without knowing (h), how can I proceed?Wait, maybe I can assign coordinates to the prism to make it easier. Let me place the base triangle (ABC) in the xy-plane with point (A) at ((0, 0, 0)), (B) at ((s, 0, 0)), and (C) at ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, 0)). Then, the upper base (A_1B_1C_1) will be at some height (h), so (A_1) is at ((0, 0, h)), (B_1) at ((s, 0, h)), and (C_1) at ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, h)).Given that, point (D) is on (BB_1), so its coordinates can be expressed as (B + t(B_1 - B)) for some (t) between 0 and 1. Similarly, point (E) is on (CC_1), so its coordinates can be expressed as (C + u(C_1 - C)) for some (u) between 0 and 1.Given the condition (EC = BC = 2BD), let's first compute (BC). Since (BC) is a side of the base triangle, its length is (s). So, (EC = s), and (BD = frac{s}{2}).Let me compute (BD). Point (B) is at ((s, 0, 0)), and point (D) is on (BB_1). The vector from (B) to (B_1) is ((0, 0, h)). So, point (D) can be expressed as ((s, 0, t h)), where (t) is between 0 and 1. The distance (BD) is the distance from (B) to (D), which is (sqrt{(s - s)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (t h - 0)^2} = t h). According to the condition, (BD = frac{s}{2}), so (t h = frac{s}{2}). Therefore, (t = frac{s}{2 h}).Similarly, point (E) is on (CC_1). The coordinates of (C) are ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, 0)), and (C_1) is at ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, h)). So, point (E) can be expressed as ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, u h)), where (u) is between 0 and 1. The distance (EC) is the distance from (E) to (C), which is (sqrt{(frac{s}{2} - frac{s}{2})^2 + (frac{sqrt{3}s}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}s}{2})^2 + (0 - u h)^2} = u h). According to the condition, (EC = s), so (u h = s). Therefore, (u = frac{s}{h}).Now, we have expressions for (t) and (u) in terms of (s) and (h). But we need another condition to relate (s) and (h). Wait, the problem doesn't specify the height of the prism, so maybe the dihedral angle is independent of the height? Or perhaps we can express it in terms of (s) and (h), but since it's a regular prism, maybe (h = s)? Wait, no, in a regular prism, the lateral edges are perpendicular to the base, but their length can be different from the base edges. However, sometimes \\"regular\\" is used to mean that it's both equilateral and equiangular, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can assume (h = s) for simplicity, as it's a common case. Let me try that. If (h = s), then (t = frac{s}{2 s} = frac{1}{2}), so (D) is the midpoint of (BB_1). Similarly, (u = frac{s}{s} = 1), so (E) is at (C_1). But earlier, I thought that might complicate things, but let's see.So, if (E) is at (C_1), then the section (ADE) would be the triangle connecting (A), (D), and (C_1). Let me write down the coordinates:- (A = (0, 0, 0))- (D = (s, 0, frac{h}{2}) = (s, 0, frac{s}{2})) since (h = s)- (E = C_1 = (frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, s))Now, I need to find the dihedral angle between the section (ADE) and the base (ABC). The dihedral angle between two planes is the angle between them along their line of intersection. In this case, the line of intersection is the line where the section (ADE) meets the base (ABC). Looking at the points, (A) is common to both, but (D) is on (BB_1) and (E) is on (CC_1). So, the line of intersection is actually the line (AD), but wait, (AD) is not entirely in the base (ABC). Hmm, maybe I need to find another approach.Alternatively, the dihedral angle can be found by considering the angle between the two planes. One plane is the base (ABC), which lies in the xy-plane, and the other plane is the section (ADE). To find the dihedral angle, I can find the angle between the normal vectors of these two planes.The normal vector of the base (ABC) is straightforward since it's in the xy-plane; it's along the z-axis, so (mathbf{n}_1 = (0, 0, 1)).Now, I need to find the normal vector of the plane (ADE). To do that, I can use three points on the plane: (A), (D), and (E). Let me write their coordinates again:- (A = (0, 0, 0))- (D = (s, 0, frac{s}{2}))- (E = (frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, s))First, I'll find two vectors lying on the plane (ADE). Let's take vectors (AD) and (AE).Vector (AD = D - A = (s, 0, frac{s}{2}))Vector (AE = E - A = (frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, s))Now, the normal vector (mathbf{n}_2) to the plane (ADE) can be found by taking the cross product of vectors (AD) and (AE).So, let's compute the cross product:[mathbf{n}_2 = AD times AE = begin{vmatrix}mathbf{i} & mathbf{j} & mathbf{k} s & 0 & frac{s}{2} frac{s}{2} & frac{sqrt{3}s}{2} & s end{vmatrix}]Calculating the determinant:[mathbf{n}_2 = mathbf{i} left(0 cdot s - frac{s}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}right) - mathbf{j} left(s cdot s - frac{s}{2} cdot frac{s}{2}right) + mathbf{k} left(s cdot frac{sqrt{3}s}{2} - 0 cdot frac{s}{2}right)]Simplify each component:- For the (mathbf{i}) component:[0 - frac{s}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}s}{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}s^2}{4}]So, (mathbf{i}) component is (-frac{sqrt{3}s^2}{4})- For the (mathbf{j}) component:[s cdot s - frac{s}{2} cdot frac{s}{2} = s^2 - frac{s^2}{4} = frac{3s^2}{4}]But since it's subtracted, it becomes (-frac{3s^2}{4})- For the (mathbf{k}) component:[s cdot frac{sqrt{3}s}{2} - 0 = frac{sqrt{3}s^2}{2}]So, putting it all together:[mathbf{n}_2 = left(-frac{sqrt{3}s^2}{4}, -frac{3s^2}{4}, frac{sqrt{3}s^2}{2}right)]We can factor out (frac{s^2}{4}) to simplify:[mathbf{n}_2 = frac{s^2}{4} left(-sqrt{3}, -3, 2sqrt{3}right)]Since the normal vector's direction is what matters, we can ignore the scalar factor:[mathbf{n}_2 = left(-sqrt{3}, -3, 2sqrt{3}right)]Now, the dihedral angle (theta) between the two planes is the angle between their normal vectors (mathbf{n}_1) and (mathbf{n}_2). The formula for the angle between two vectors is:[costheta = frac{mathbf{n}_1 cdot mathbf{n}_2}{|mathbf{n}_1| |mathbf{n}_2|}]First, compute the dot product:[mathbf{n}_1 cdot mathbf{n}_2 = (0)(-sqrt{3}) + (0)(-3) + (1)(2sqrt{3}) = 2sqrt{3}]Next, compute the magnitudes:[|mathbf{n}_1| = sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = 1][|mathbf{n}_2| = sqrt{(-sqrt{3})^2 + (-3)^2 + (2sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{3 + 9 + 12} = sqrt{24} = 2sqrt{6}]So,[costheta = frac{2sqrt{3}}{1 times 2sqrt{6}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{6}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]Therefore, the angle (theta) is:[theta = arccosleft(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = 45^circ]Wait, but this is the angle between the normal vectors. The dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, which is equal to the angle between the normal vectors if they are oriented in a certain way. However, sometimes the dihedral angle is considered as the supplementary angle if the normals are pointing in opposite directions. But in this case, since both normals are pointing upwards (the base normal is upwards, and the section plane's normal also has a positive z-component), the angle between them is indeed the dihedral angle.Therefore, the dihedral angle between the section (ADE) and the base (ABC) is (45^circ).But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Assigned coordinates correctly? Yes, I think so. Placed (A) at the origin, (B) along the x-axis, and (C) in the xy-plane.2. Expressed points (D) and (E) correctly? Yes, using parameters (t) and (u), and then found (t) and (u) based on the given conditions.3. Assumed (h = s) for simplicity? That might be a point of concern. If (h) is not equal to (s), the result might change. But since the problem didn't specify the height, maybe it's intended to assume (h = s). Alternatively, perhaps the dihedral angle is the same regardless of (h). Let me see.Wait, if I don't assume (h = s), let's redo the calculations with (h) as a variable.So, point (D) is at ((s, 0, frac{s}{2 h} h) = (s, 0, frac{s}{2})). Wait, no, actually, (t = frac{s}{2 h}), so (D) is at ((s, 0, t h) = (s, 0, frac{s}{2})). Similarly, point (E) is at ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, u h) = (frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, s)), since (u = frac{s}{h}).Wait, so regardless of (h), point (D) is always at ((s, 0, frac{s}{2})) and point (E) is at ((frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, s)). So, the coordinates of (D) and (E) don't depend on (h), which is interesting.Therefore, the vectors (AD) and (AE) are:- (AD = (s, 0, frac{s}{2}))- (AE = (frac{s}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}s}{2}, s))So, the cross product calculation remains the same, and the normal vector (mathbf{n}_2) is still (left(-sqrt{3}, -3, 2sqrt{3}right)), independent of (h).Therefore, the dihedral angle calculation is also independent of (h), and we still get (theta = 45^circ).So, even without assuming (h = s), the dihedral angle is (45^circ). That's reassuring.Therefore, the measure of the dihedral angle between the section (ADE) and the base (ABC) is (45^circ).**Final Answer**The measure of the dihedral angle is boxed{45^circ}."},{"question":"The domain of the function f(x) = log(1-x) is ___.","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out the domain of the function f(x) = log(1 - x). Hmm, I remember that for logarithmic functions, the argument inside the log has to be positive because you can't take the log of zero or a negative number. So, that means whatever is inside the log, which is (1 - x) in this case, has to be greater than zero. Alright, so I can write that as an inequality: 1 - x > 0. Now, I need to solve this inequality for x. Let me think about how to do that. If I subtract 1 from both sides, I get -x > -1. But wait, when I multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, if I multiply both sides by -1, the inequality becomes x < 1. Okay, so that tells me that x has to be less than 1. But what about values of x that are equal to 1? If x is exactly 1, then 1 - x would be 0, and log(0) is undefined because logarithm approaches negative infinity as it approaches zero from the right. So, x can't be equal to 1 either. Putting it all together, the domain of f(x) is all real numbers x such that x is less than 1. In interval notation, that would be from negative infinity up to, but not including, 1. So, the domain is (-∞, 1). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If I pick a value less than 1, say x = 0, then 1 - 0 = 1, and log(1) is 0, which is fine. If I pick x = 2, which is greater than 1, then 1 - 2 = -1, and log(-1) is undefined, which matches my earlier conclusion. And if x = 1, then 1 - 1 = 0, and log(0) is undefined, so that's also correct. So, I think I did this right. The key was remembering that the argument of the logarithm has to be positive and then solving the resulting inequality correctly, especially remembering to flip the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. It's easy to forget that step, but it's crucial for getting the correct domain."},{"question":"In a regular 1000-gon, all diagonals are drawn. What is the maximum number of diagonals that can be selected such that among any three of the chosen diagonals, at least two have the same length?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular 1000-gon where all the diagonals are drawn. I need to find the maximum number of diagonals I can select such that among any three chosen diagonals, at least two have the same length. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.First, I know that in a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. A 1000-gon must have 1000 sides, so it's a polygon with 1000 vertices. Now, when they say all diagonals are drawn, that means every possible line connecting two non-adjacent vertices is there. But I don't need to consider all of them; instead, I need to select a subset of these diagonals with a specific property.The property is that among any three diagonals I pick from this subset, at least two must have the same length. So, if I pick any three diagonals, they can't all be of different lengths. That means my subset can't have too many different lengths of diagonals. If I have too many different lengths, it's possible to pick three that are all different, which would violate the condition.Let me think about how diagonals work in a regular polygon. In a regular n-gon, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices apart the two connected vertices are. For example, in a regular pentagon, the diagonals that skip one vertex are longer than the sides, but in a regular hexagon, diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.In a regular 1000-gon, the number of different diagonal lengths should be equal to the number of different ways you can connect two vertices that aren't adjacent. Since it's a regular polygon, each diagonal length corresponds to a specific step between vertices. For a polygon with n sides, the number of different diagonal lengths is floor(n/2) - 1. So for 1000 sides, that would be 500 - 1 = 499 different lengths. Wait, is that right?Actually, in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is floor((n-1)/2). For n=1000, that would be floor(999/2) = 499. So, there are 499 different lengths of diagonals. Each length corresponds to a specific step between vertices, from 2 up to 500 steps apart. Because beyond 500 steps, the diagonals start repeating in the other direction.So, each diagonal length is determined by the number of edges they skip. For example, a diagonal that skips 1 vertex is one length, skips 2 vertices is another, and so on up to skipping 499 vertices. Wait, but in a 1000-gon, skipping 500 vertices would actually connect opposite vertices, right? So, that's a diameter of the polygon. So, that's another length, making it 500 different lengths.Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify. For a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is floor(n/2) - 1. So, for n=1000, it's 500 - 1 = 499. But actually, when n is even, like 1000, the diameter is also a diagonal, so maybe it's 500 different lengths. Hmm, I need to be precise here.Let me think. In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, the diameter is a diagonal that connects two opposite vertices. So, in a 1000-gon, the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. So, skipping 1 vertex, skipping 2 vertices, ..., up to skipping 499 vertices, and then skipping 500 vertices would be the diameter. So, that's 500 different lengths. Therefore, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is 500.Okay, so there are 500 different lengths of diagonals in a regular 1000-gon. Each length corresponds to a specific step between vertices, from 1 step (which is actually a side, not a diagonal) up to 500 steps, which is the diameter. But since sides aren't considered diagonals, the diagonals start from skipping 2 vertices, so that's 2 steps apart, up to 500 steps apart. So, that's 499 different lengths. Wait, now I'm confused again.Wait, no. Let me think again. In a regular polygon, the sides are the edges connecting adjacent vertices. Diagonals are the connections between non-adjacent vertices. So, in a 1000-gon, each vertex is connected to 997 other vertices (since it can't connect to itself or its two adjacent vertices). But these connections are diagonals, and their lengths depend on how many vertices they skip.So, for each vertex, the diagonals can skip 2, 3, ..., up to 499 vertices on one side, and similarly on the other side, but since the polygon is regular, skipping k vertices on one side is the same as skipping (1000 - k - 2) vertices on the other side. Therefore, the distinct diagonal lengths are determined by the minimum number of skips, so from 2 up to 500 skips. Wait, 500 skips would be the diameter.So, in total, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is 499 (from 2 to 500 skips), but wait, 500 skips is a unique length, so maybe it's 500 different lengths. Hmm.Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is floor(n/2) - 1. So, for n=1000, that would be 500 - 1 = 499. So, 499 different lengths. But then, the diameter is another length, making it 500. Hmm, I think I need to confirm this.Let me check with a smaller polygon, like a hexagon (6-gon). In a regular hexagon, the diagonals can be of two different lengths: the shorter diagonals (skipping one vertex) and the longer diagonals (skipping two vertices, which are the diameters). So, that's two different lengths. According to the formula floor(n/2) - 1, that would be 3 - 1 = 2, which matches. So, in a hexagon, it's 2 different diagonal lengths.Similarly, in a pentagon (5-gon), the number of distinct diagonal lengths is floor(5/2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. But in a pentagon, all diagonals are of the same length, so that also matches. So, for n=1000, it's floor(1000/2) - 1 = 500 - 1 = 499. So, 499 different diagonal lengths.Wait, but in the hexagon, the diameters are a separate length, but according to the formula, it's still 2 different lengths, which includes the diameters. So, in the case of n=1000, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is 499, which includes the diameters. So, the diameters are just one of the 499 lengths.Okay, so in a regular 1000-gon, there are 499 different lengths of diagonals. Each length corresponds to a specific step between vertices, from 2 up to 500 steps apart, but since beyond 500 steps, it's the same as stepping back from the other side, so we only have 499 distinct lengths.Now, the problem is to select as many diagonals as possible such that among any three chosen diagonals, at least two have the same length. So, in other words, we cannot have three diagonals all of different lengths in our selected set.This reminds me of the pigeonhole principle. If we have a set where the number of elements is such that any three elements must have at least two sharing a common property (in this case, length), then we need to limit the number of different properties (lengths) in the set.In combinatorics, this is similar to ensuring that the set does not contain a 3-length antichain. An antichain is a set where no two elements are comparable, but in this case, it's about lengths. So, we need to avoid having three elements all with distinct lengths.One way to ensure this is to limit the number of different lengths in our set. If we have only two different lengths, then any three diagonals must include at least two of the same length, because there are only two lengths. So, if we have two lengths, say length A and length B, then any three diagonals will have at least two of A or two of B.But wait, actually, if we have two lengths, then the maximum number of diagonals we can have without having three of different lengths is not necessarily just two lengths. Because even with two lengths, you can have multiple diagonals of each length, and if you have enough diagonals, you might still end up with three diagonals of different lengths if you have more than two lengths.Wait, no. If we restrict ourselves to only two lengths, then any three diagonals can only be of those two lengths. So, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them must be of the same length. Therefore, if we select diagonals of only two different lengths, we satisfy the condition.But is two lengths the maximum? Or can we have more lengths without violating the condition?Wait, if we have three different lengths, then it's possible to pick one diagonal of each length, which would violate the condition because among those three, all have different lengths. Therefore, to ensure that among any three diagonals, at least two have the same length, we cannot have more than two different lengths in our selected set.Therefore, the maximum number of diagonals we can select is the sum of the number of diagonals of two different lengths. So, we need to find two lengths such that the total number of diagonals of those two lengths is maximized.But wait, in a regular polygon, each diagonal length corresponds to a certain number of diagonals. For example, in a regular n-gon, the number of diagonals of a specific length (say, skipping k vertices) is n, because each vertex is part of one such diagonal. But wait, no, actually, for each length, the number of diagonals is n/2 if n is even, because each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end). Wait, no, let me think again.In a regular n-gon, for each step k (where k is the number of vertices skipped), the number of diagonals of that length is n, because each vertex is connected to the vertex k steps away, and since the polygon is regular, each such diagonal is unique. However, when n is even, the diameter (k = n/2) is only counted once per diameter, but actually, each diameter connects two vertices, so the number of diameters is n/2.Wait, let me clarify. For a regular n-gon, the number of diagonals of a specific length (skipping k vertices) is n for k = 1, 2, ..., floor((n-1)/2). But when k = n/2 (if n is even), the number of such diagonals is n/2 because each diameter is shared by two vertices.So, for n=1000, which is even, the number of diagonals for each length is:- For k = 2 to 499: each length has 1000 diagonals.- For k = 500: the number of diameters is 1000/2 = 500.Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, for each k from 1 to 499, the number of diagonals is 1000, but when k=500, it's 500.Wait, no, actually, for each k from 1 to 499, the number of diagonals is 1000, but when k=500, it's 500 because each diameter is shared by two vertices.Wait, let me think again. For each k, the number of diagonals is n if k ≠ n/2, and n/2 if k = n/2. So, for n=1000, for k=2 to 499, each length has 1000 diagonals, and for k=500, it's 500 diagonals.But wait, actually, for each k, the number of diagonals is n, but when k = n/2, each diagonal is counted twice, so we have to divide by 2. So, for k=500, the number of unique diameters is 500.Therefore, in total, for each length from k=2 to k=500, the number of diagonals is:- For k=2 to 499: 1000 diagonals each.- For k=500: 500 diagonals.So, if we want to select diagonals of two different lengths, we can choose two lengths from k=2 to k=499, each contributing 1000 diagonals, or one from k=2 to 499 and one from k=500.But to maximize the number of diagonals, we should choose two lengths from k=2 to 499, each with 1000 diagonals, giving a total of 2000 diagonals.Alternatively, if we choose one length from k=2 to 499 (1000 diagonals) and one length from k=500 (500 diagonals), we get 1500 diagonals, which is less than 2000.Therefore, the maximum number of diagonals we can select is 2000, consisting of two different lengths, each with 1000 diagonals.But wait, let me make sure. If we select two lengths, each with 1000 diagonals, then the total is 2000. But in the problem, it's a regular 1000-gon, so each diagonal is uniquely determined by its length and position. So, selecting two lengths, each with 1000 diagonals, is possible because each length has 1000 diagonals.But wait, actually, in a regular 1000-gon, for each k from 2 to 499, the number of diagonals is 1000, but each diagonal is shared by two vertices, so actually, the number of unique diagonals for each k is 1000/2 = 500. Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, no, each diagonal is uniquely identified by its two endpoints. So, for each k, the number of diagonals is n, because each vertex is connected to the vertex k steps away, and since the polygon is regular, each such diagonal is unique. However, when k = n/2, each diagonal is shared by two vertices, so the number of unique diameters is n/2.Wait, let me think with a smaller n. Let's take n=6 (hexagon). For k=2, the number of diagonals is 6, but in reality, a hexagon has 3 unique diameters. Wait, no, in a hexagon, each vertex connects to the vertex two steps away, which are the diameters. So, for k=2, the number of diagonals is 6, but since each diameter is shared by two vertices, the number of unique diameters is 3.Wait, so in general, for a regular n-gon, the number of unique diagonals for each k is n if k ≠ n/2, and n/2 if k = n/2.Wait, no, that can't be because in a hexagon, for k=1, the number of sides is 6, but for k=2, the number of diameters is 3.Wait, perhaps the formula is that for each k from 1 to floor(n/2), the number of unique diagonals is n if k ≠ n/2, and n/2 if k = n/2.But in a hexagon, for k=1, it's sides, not diagonals. For k=2, it's diameters, which are 3 unique diagonals. For k=3, it's the same as k=3 in a hexagon, which is the same as k=3, but since 6/2=3, so it's the same as k=3, which is the diameter again. Wait, no, in a hexagon, k=3 would connect each vertex to the vertex three steps away, which is the same as the opposite vertex, so it's the same as k=3.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.In a regular n-gon, for each k from 1 to floor(n/2), the number of unique diagonals of that length is n if k ≠ n/2, and n/2 if k = n/2.But in a hexagon (n=6), for k=1, it's sides, not diagonals. For k=2, it's diagonals, and the number is 6/2=3 unique diameters. For k=3, it's the same as k=3, which is the same as k=3, but since 6/2=3, it's the same as k=3, which is the diameter again. Wait, no, in a hexagon, k=3 would connect each vertex to the vertex three steps away, which is the same as the opposite vertex, so it's the same as k=3, which is the diameter again. So, in a hexagon, the number of unique diameters is 3.Wait, so in general, for each k from 1 to floor(n/2), the number of unique diagonals is n if k ≠ n/2, and n/2 if k = n/2.But in a hexagon, for k=2, the number of unique diagonals is 3, which is n/2=3. So, that seems to fit.Similarly, in a pentagon (n=5), for k=2, the number of unique diagonals is 5, because each vertex connects to two others, but since it's a pentagon, each diagonal is unique and there are 5 of them.Wait, but in a pentagon, n=5, so for k=2, the number of unique diagonals is 5, which is n. So, that fits the formula.Therefore, in general, for a regular n-gon, the number of unique diagonals for each k is:- If k ≠ n/2, then the number is n.- If k = n/2, then the number is n/2.But wait, in a hexagon, for k=2, which is n/2=3, the number of unique diagonals is 3, which is n/2=3. So, that fits.Therefore, in a regular 1000-gon, for each k from 2 to 499, the number of unique diagonals is 1000, and for k=500, the number of unique diagonals is 500.Wait, but in a regular 1000-gon, for k=2, the number of unique diagonals is 1000, because each vertex connects to the vertex two steps away, and since it's a regular polygon, each such diagonal is unique. Similarly, for k=3, it's 1000, and so on, up to k=499, which is 1000. For k=500, it's 500 unique diameters.Therefore, if we want to select diagonals of two different lengths, we can choose two k's from 2 to 499, each contributing 1000 diagonals, giving a total of 2000 diagonals. Alternatively, we could choose one k from 2 to 499 and one k=500, giving 1000 + 500 = 1500 diagonals, which is less than 2000.Therefore, the maximum number of diagonals we can select is 2000.But wait, let me make sure. If we select two lengths, each with 1000 diagonals, then any three diagonals selected from this set will have at least two of the same length, because there are only two lengths. So, by the pigeonhole principle, among any three diagonals, at least two must be of the same length.Yes, that makes sense. So, 2000 diagonals is the maximum number we can select without violating the condition.Wait, but is there a way to select more than 2000 diagonals while still satisfying the condition? For example, if we select three lengths, but arrange it in such a way that no three diagonals are all of different lengths. But that seems impossible because if we have three lengths, we can always pick one diagonal from each length, resulting in three diagonals all of different lengths, which violates the condition.Therefore, the maximum number of diagonals we can select is indeed 2000, consisting of two different lengths, each with 1000 diagonals.So, the answer should be 2000."},{"question":"The sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequences {a_n} and {b_n} are S_n and T_n respectively.

Let me try to understand what it's asking. We have two arithmetic sequences, {a_n} and {b_n}. The sum of the first n terms of {a_n} is S_n, and the sum of the first n terms of {b_n} is T_n. It's given that the ratio of S_n to T_n is (2n + 1)/(3n + 2). The question is asking for the ratio (a_3 + a_{11} + a_{19}) / (b_7 + b_{15}). The options are A: 69/70, B: 129/130, C: 123/124, D: 135/136.Hmm, okay. So I need to find this specific ratio involving terms from both sequences. First, let me recall some properties of arithmetic sequences. In an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. Similarly, for the sequence {b_n}, the nth term is b_n = b_1 + (n - 1)e, where b_1 is the first term and e is the common difference for {b_n}.The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is S_n = n/2 [2a_1 + (n - 1)d] for {a_n}, and T_n = n/2 [2b_1 + (n - 1)e] for {b_n}.Given that S_n / T_n = (2n + 1)/(3n + 2). So, substituting the expressions for S_n and T_n, we have:[n/2 (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)] / [n/2 (2b_1 + (n - 1)e)] = (2n + 1)/(3n + 2)Simplify this:(2a_1 + (n - 1)d) / (2b_1 + (n - 1)e) = (2n + 1)/(3n + 2)So, the ratio of the linear expressions in n is equal to (2n + 1)/(3n + 2). That suggests that the coefficients of n and the constants in the numerator and denominator must be proportional.Let me denote:Let’s write 2a_1 + (n - 1)d = k(2n + 1)and 2b_1 + (n - 1)e = k(3n + 2)Wait, but actually, since the ratio is (2n + 1)/(3n + 2), it's possible that 2a_1 + (n - 1)d is proportional to (2n + 1) and 2b_1 + (n - 1)e is proportional to (3n + 2). So, maybe:2a_1 + (n - 1)d = k(2n + 1)2b_1 + (n - 1)e = k(3n + 2)But since k is a constant, it would have to be the same for both. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is equal to (2n + 1)/(3n + 2), so we can set up the equation:(2a_1 + (n - 1)d) / (2b_1 + (n - 1)e) = (2n + 1)/(3n + 2)Cross-multiplying gives:(2a_1 + (n - 1)d)(3n + 2) = (2b_1 + (n - 1)e)(2n + 1)This equation must hold for all n, so the coefficients of n^2, n, and the constants must be equal on both sides.Let me expand both sides:Left side: (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)(3n + 2) = [2a_1 + dn - d](3n + 2) = 2a_1*3n + 2a_1*2 + dn*3n + dn*2 - d*3n - d*2Simplify:= 6a_1 n + 4a_1 + 3d n^2 + 2d n - 3d n - 2dCombine like terms:= 3d n^2 + (6a_1 + 2d - 3d) n + (4a_1 - 2d)Simplify:= 3d n^2 + (6a_1 - d) n + (4a_1 - 2d)Right side: (2b_1 + (n - 1)e)(2n + 1) = [2b_1 + en - e](2n + 1) = 2b_1*2n + 2b_1*1 + en*2n + en*1 - e*2n - e*1Simplify:= 4b_1 n + 2b_1 + 2e n^2 + e n - 2e n - eCombine like terms:= 2e n^2 + (4b_1 + e - 2e) n + (2b_1 - e)Simplify:= 2e n^2 + (4b_1 - e) n + (2b_1 - e)Now, set the coefficients equal:Left side: 3d n^2 + (6a_1 - d) n + (4a_1 - 2d)Right side: 2e n^2 + (4b_1 - e) n + (2b_1 - e)So, equate coefficients:1. For n^2: 3d = 2e2. For n: 6a_1 - d = 4b_1 - e3. For constants: 4a_1 - 2d = 2b_1 - eNow, we have a system of equations:From equation 1: 3d = 2e => e = (3d)/2From equation 3: 4a_1 - 2d = 2b_1 - eSubstitute e from equation 1 into equation 3:4a_1 - 2d = 2b_1 - (3d)/2Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:8a_1 - 4d = 4b_1 - 3dBring all terms to one side:8a_1 - 4d - 4b_1 + 3d = 0 => 8a_1 - 4b_1 - d = 0 => 8a_1 - 4b_1 = dSo, d = 8a_1 - 4b_1Now, from equation 2: 6a_1 - d = 4b_1 - eAgain, substitute e = (3d)/2:6a_1 - d = 4b_1 - (3d)/2Multiply both sides by 2:12a_1 - 2d = 8b_1 - 3dBring all terms to one side:12a_1 - 2d - 8b_1 + 3d = 0 => 12a_1 - 8b_1 + d = 0But from earlier, d = 8a_1 - 4b_1. Substitute this into the equation:12a_1 - 8b_1 + (8a_1 - 4b_1) = 0Simplify:12a_1 - 8b_1 + 8a_1 - 4b_1 = 0 => 20a_1 - 12b_1 = 0Divide both sides by 4:5a_1 - 3b_1 = 0 => 5a_1 = 3b_1 => b_1 = (5/3)a_1Now, substitute b_1 = (5/3)a_1 into d = 8a_1 - 4b_1:d = 8a_1 - 4*(5/3)a_1 = 8a_1 - (20/3)a_1 = (24/3 - 20/3)a_1 = (4/3)a_1So, d = (4/3)a_1And since e = (3d)/2 = (3*(4/3)a_1)/2 = (4a_1)/2 = 2a_1So, e = 2a_1So, now we have expressions for b_1 and e in terms of a_1:b_1 = (5/3)a_1e = 2a_1Okay, so now we can express both sequences in terms of a_1.For {a_n}:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = a_1 + (n - 1)*(4/3)a_1 = a_1 + (4/3)a_1(n - 1)Similarly, for {b_n}:b_n = b_1 + (n - 1)e = (5/3)a_1 + (n - 1)*2a_1 = (5/3)a_1 + 2a_1(n - 1)Now, let's compute the numerator and denominator of the ratio we need.Numerator: a_3 + a_{11} + a_{19}Compute each term:a_3 = a_1 + 2d = a_1 + 2*(4/3)a_1 = a_1 + (8/3)a_1 = (11/3)a_1a_{11} = a_1 + 10d = a_1 + 10*(4/3)a_1 = a_1 + (40/3)a_1 = (43/3)a_1a_{19} = a_1 + 18d = a_1 + 18*(4/3)a_1 = a_1 + 24a_1 = 25a_1So, a_3 + a_{11} + a_{19} = (11/3)a_1 + (43/3)a_1 + 25a_1Convert 25a_1 to thirds: 25a_1 = 75/3 a_1So, total numerator: (11 + 43 + 75)/3 a_1 = 129/3 a_1 = 43a_1Denominator: b_7 + b_{15}Compute each term:b_7 = b_1 + 6e = (5/3)a_1 + 6*2a_1 = (5/3)a_1 + 12a_1 = (5/3 + 36/3)a_1 = 41/3 a_1b_{15} = b_1 + 14e = (5/3)a_1 + 14*2a_1 = (5/3)a_1 + 28a_1 = (5/3 + 84/3)a_1 = 89/3 a_1So, b_7 + b_{15} = (41/3 + 89/3)a_1 = 130/3 a_1Therefore, the ratio is (43a_1) / (130/3 a_1) = (43) / (130/3) = 43 * (3/130) = 129/130So, the answer is B: 129/130.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, for a_n:a_3: 11/3 a_1a_{11}: 43/3 a_1a_{19}: 25a_1Sum: 11/3 + 43/3 + 25 = (11 + 43)/3 + 25 = 54/3 + 25 = 18 + 25 = 43. Wait, 11 + 43 is 54, divided by 3 is 18, plus 25 is 43. So numerator is 43a_1.Denominator:b_7: 41/3 a_1b_{15}: 89/3 a_1Sum: 41 + 89 = 130, divided by 3: 130/3 a_1So, ratio is 43 / (130/3) = 43 * 3 / 130 = 129/130. Yep, that's correct.So, the answer is B: 129/130."},{"question":"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day.

The washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day, and there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed.I'll divide the total pounds of clothes by the washing machine's capacity to find the number of full loads:200 pounds ÷ 28 pounds per load = 7.14 loadsSince the washing machine can only handle whole loads, it can complete 7 full loads.Next, I'll calculate the total weight of the clothes that can be washed in these 7 full loads:7 loads × 28 pounds per load = 196 poundsFinally, I'll find out how many pounds of clothes are left for the last load that isn't fully loaded by subtracting the weight of the full loads from the total weight:200 pounds - 196 pounds = 4 poundsTherefore, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes 4 pounds of clothes per day."},{"question":"There are 7 university students (4 males and 3 females) who are divided into two groups for a night run, reuniting at the finish line. If it is required that females cannot form a group alone, and each group must have at least 2 people, then there are ( ) different allocation methods.A: 52 typesB: 55 typesC: 104 typesD: 110 types","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about dividing 7 university students into two groups for a night run. There are 4 males and 3 females. The requirements are that females cannot form a group alone, and each group must have at least 2 people. I need to figure out how many different allocation methods there are, and the options are A: 52, B: 55, C: 104, D: 110.First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have 7 students, and we need to split them into two groups. Each group must have at least 2 people, so the possible group sizes are either 2 and 5 or 3 and 4. The key constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. That means in neither of the groups can all the females be grouped together without any males.Let me break this down step by step.**Step 1: Determine Possible Group Sizes**Since each group must have at least 2 people, the possible ways to split 7 students into two groups are:- Group 1: 2 people, Group 2: 5 people- Group 1: 3 people, Group 2: 4 peopleThese are the only two possibilities because if one group has 1 person, that would leave the other group with 6, but each group must have at least 2 people.**Step 2: Calculate Total Possible Allocations Without Constraints**First, I'll calculate the total number of ways to split the students into groups without considering the constraint about females not forming a group alone.For group sizes of 2 and 5:The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 7 is given by the combination formula:[C(7, 2) = frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = 21]Similarly, for group sizes of 3 and 4:[C(7, 3) = frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35]So, the total number of ways without any constraints is:[21 + 35 = 56]But wait, this counts each division twice because splitting into Group A and Group B is the same as splitting into Group B and Group A. So, to get the actual number of unique allocations, I should divide by 2:[frac{56}{2} = 28]Hmm, but this doesn't align with the answer choices. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps I shouldn't be dividing by 2 because the problem doesn't specify that the groups are indistinct. It just says two groups, so maybe each division is unique based on the group sizes. Let me think.Actually, in combinatorics, when we split a set into two groups of different sizes, the order doesn't matter. So, Group A with 2 and Group B with 5 is the same as Group A with 5 and Group B with 2. Therefore, the total number of unique allocations without constraints is indeed 28.But the answer choices are all above 50, so clearly, my initial approach is missing something.**Step 3: Incorporate the Constraint**The constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. That means in neither group can all the females be grouped together without any males. So, I need to subtract the cases where all 3 females are in one group.Let me handle each group size case separately.**Case 1: Group Sizes of 2 and 5**First, calculate the number of ways where all 3 females are in the group of 5.To form a group of 5 with all 3 females, we need to choose 2 more males from the 4 available:[C(4, 2) = 6]So, there are 6 ways where all females are in the group of 5. Since the group of 2 would then consist of 2 males, this violates the constraint because the females are alone in the larger group.Similarly, check if all females can be in the group of 2. But since there are 3 females, it's impossible to have all 3 in a group of 2. So, only the group of 5 can potentially have all females.Therefore, the number of invalid allocations for group sizes of 2 and 5 is 6.So, the valid allocations for this case are:[C(7, 2) - C(4, 2) = 21 - 6 = 15]**Case 2: Group Sizes of 3 and 4**Now, calculate the number of ways where all 3 females are in the group of 4.To form a group of 4 with all 3 females, we need to choose 1 more male from the 4 available:[C(4, 1) = 4]So, there are 4 ways where all females are in the group of 4. The group of 3 would then consist of 3 males, which is acceptable because the females are not alone in the group of 4.Wait, but the constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, if all females are in the group of 4, that's still acceptable because they are not alone; they are with a male. The problem is only when all females are grouped together without any males.Wait, no. Let me read the constraint again: \\"females cannot form a group alone.\\" So, if all females are in one group, regardless of the group size, as long as there's at least one male in the same group, it's okay. The problem is if all females are in a group without any males.Therefore, in the group of 4, having all 3 females and 1 male is acceptable because they are not alone. The only invalid case is when all females are in a group with no males.But in this case, the group of 4 has 3 females and 1 male, which is acceptable. So, actually, there are no invalid allocations in this case because even if all females are in a group, they are not alone; they are with a male.Wait, but let's think again. The constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, if all females are in a group, even if it's not alone, but with males, is that allowed? Or is the constraint that females cannot be in a group without any males?I think it's the latter. The constraint is that females cannot form a group alone, meaning that a group cannot consist solely of females. So, if all females are in a group with at least one male, that's acceptable. Therefore, in the group of 4, having 3 females and 1 male is acceptable because they are not alone.Therefore, in this case, there are no invalid allocations because even if all females are in a group, they are not alone. So, the number of valid allocations for this case is simply the total number of ways to split into groups of 3 and 4:[C(7, 3) = 35]But wait, earlier I thought that the total number of unique allocations without constraints was 28, but now I'm getting 15 + 35 = 50, which is close to the answer choices but not exactly matching.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the group sizes. Let me re-examine.**Re-examining Group Sizes**When we split into groups of 2 and 5, the number of ways is C(7,2) = 21. However, since the groups are indistinct, we need to consider that splitting into group A (2) and group B (5) is the same as group A (5) and group B (2). Therefore, the number of unique allocations for group sizes of 2 and 5 is actually 21, not 15.But earlier, I subtracted the invalid cases where all females are in the group of 5, which was 6. So, 21 - 6 = 15 valid allocations for group sizes of 2 and 5.Similarly, for group sizes of 3 and 4, the number of ways is C(7,3) = 35. Since there are no invalid cases here, all 35 are valid.Therefore, the total number of valid allocations is 15 + 35 = 50.But the answer choices are 52, 55, 104, 110. So, 50 is not among them. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the group sizes. Maybe I need to consider that the groups are distinct, meaning that group A and group B are different, so I shouldn't divide by 2.Let me think about this again.If the groups are labeled (e.g., Group 1 and Group 2), then the total number of ways to split into groups of 2 and 5 is C(7,2) = 21, and for groups of 3 and 4 is C(7,3) = 35. So, total is 21 + 35 = 56.But if the groups are unlabeled, meaning that splitting into Group A (2) and Group B (5) is the same as Group A (5) and Group B (2), then we need to divide by 2, resulting in 28.But the problem doesn't specify whether the groups are labeled or not. It just says \\"two groups.\\" In combinatorics, unless specified otherwise, groups are usually considered unlabeled. So, the total number of unique allocations without constraints is 28.However, when considering the constraint, we need to subtract the cases where all females are in one group. Let's see.**Re-examining the Constraint**The constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, we need to ensure that in neither group are all the females present without any males.So, for group sizes of 2 and 5:- If all 3 females are in the group of 5, then the group of 2 would consist of 2 males. This is invalid because the females are alone in the group of 5.- If all 3 females are in the group of 2, it's impossible because there are only 2 spots and 3 females.Therefore, the only invalid case is when all females are in the group of 5. The number of such cases is C(4,2) = 6, as calculated earlier.So, the number of valid allocations for group sizes of 2 and 5 is 21 - 6 = 15.For group sizes of 3 and 4:- If all 3 females are in the group of 4, then the group of 3 would consist of 3 males. This is acceptable because the females are not alone; they are with a male.- If all 3 females are in the group of 3, then the group of 4 would consist of 4 males. This is also acceptable because the females are not alone; they are in a group of 3 with no males, but wait, no, the constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, if all 3 females are in the group of 3, that would mean they are alone in that group, which violates the constraint.Wait, that's a good point. I didn't consider that earlier. So, in the group of 3, if all 3 are females, that's invalid because they are alone in that group.Therefore, in addition to the group of 5, we also need to subtract the cases where all females are in the group of 3.So, for group sizes of 3 and 4:- Number of ways where all females are in the group of 3: C(4,0) = 1 (choosing 0 males to join the 3 females).- Number of ways where all females are in the group of 4: C(4,1) = 4 (choosing 1 male to join the 3 females).But wait, the constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, if all females are in the group of 3, that's invalid because they are alone. Similarly, if all females are in the group of 4, that's acceptable because they are with a male.Therefore, the number of invalid allocations for group sizes of 3 and 4 is 1.So, the number of valid allocations for this case is:[C(7,3) - C(4,0) = 35 - 1 = 34]Therefore, the total number of valid allocations is:15 (for group sizes of 2 and 5) + 34 (for group sizes of 3 and 4) = 49But 49 is still not among the answer choices. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the group sizes. Let me try a different approach.**Alternative Approach: Using Inclusion-Exclusion**Total number of ways to split into two groups with sizes 2 and 5, or 3 and 4, without any constraints is 28 (as calculated earlier).Now, subtract the number of allocations where all females are in one group.Number of ways where all females are in the group of 5:- Choose 2 males to join the 3 females in the group of 5: C(4,2) = 6Number of ways where all females are in the group of 3:- Choose 0 males to join the 3 females in the group of 3: C(4,0) = 1Therefore, total invalid allocations: 6 + 1 = 7Thus, valid allocations: 28 - 7 = 21But 21 is still not among the answer choices. This is confusing.Wait, perhaps the initial total number of allocations is different. Let me think again.When splitting into two groups, if the groups are labeled (e.g., Group A and Group B), the total number of ways is 2^7 - 2 = 126 (excluding the cases where all are in one group or the other). But since each group must have at least 2 people, we need to subtract the cases where one group has 1 person.Number of ways where one group has 1 person: 7 (choosing 1 person for group A, the rest go to group B). Since groups are labeled, we have 7 * 2 = 14 such cases.Therefore, total number of allocations with groups labeled and each group having at least 2 people is 126 - 14 = 112.But this seems too high. The answer choices are up to 110, so maybe this is the right direction.But the constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, we need to subtract the cases where all females are in one group.Number of ways where all females are in group A:- Choose all 3 females for group A, and at least 2 people in group A. So, group A can have 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 people, but since group B must have at least 2 people, group A can have at most 5 people.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of labeled groups.If groups are labeled, the total number of ways to split 7 students into two groups with at least 2 people each is:For group sizes of 2 and 5:- C(7,2) = 21For group sizes of 3 and 4:- C(7,3) = 35Total: 21 + 35 = 56Now, subtract the invalid cases where all females are in one group.Number of ways where all females are in group A (size 5):- Choose 2 males to join the 3 females: C(4,2) = 6Number of ways where all females are in group A (size 3):- Choose 0 males to join the 3 females: C(4,0) = 1Similarly, for group B, since groups are labeled, we have to consider all females in group B as well.Number of ways where all females are in group B (size 5):- Choose 2 males to join the 3 females: C(4,2) = 6Number of ways where all females are in group B (size 3):- Choose 0 males to join the 3 females: C(4,0) = 1Therefore, total invalid allocations: 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 14Thus, valid allocations: 56 - 14 = 42But 42 is still not among the answer choices. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.**Using Multiplication Principle**Each student can be assigned to either Group A or Group B, with the constraints:- Each group has at least 2 people.- Females cannot form a group alone.So, total number of assignments without constraints: 2^7 = 128Subtract the cases where one group has fewer than 2 people:- All in Group A: 1- All in Group B: 1- One person in Group A: 7- One person in Group B: 7Total invalid: 1 + 1 + 7 + 7 = 16Thus, total valid assignments: 128 - 16 = 112Now, subtract the cases where all females are in one group.Number of ways where all females are in Group A:- Assign all 3 females to Group A.- Assign the 4 males to either Group A or Group B, with the condition that Group A must have at least 2 people.Since all 3 females are in Group A, Group A already has 3 people, so the males can be assigned freely, but Group B must have at least 2 people.Number of ways:- Assign all 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: C(4,1) = 4- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: C(4,2) = 6- Assign 1 male to Group A and 3 to Group B: C(4,3) = 4- Assign 0 males to Group A and 4 to Group B: 1 wayBut we need to ensure that Group B has at least 2 people. So, if all 4 males are assigned to Group B, Group B would have 4 people, which is acceptable. Similarly, if 3 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 3 people, which is acceptable. If 2 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 2 people, which is acceptable. If 1 male is assigned to Group B, Group B has 1 person, which is invalid. Similarly, if 0 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 0 people, which is invalid.Therefore, the valid assignments where all females are in Group A are:- Assign 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: 4 ways- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: 6 waysTotal: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 waysSimilarly, the number of ways where all females are in Group B is also 11.Therefore, total invalid assignments: 11 + 11 = 22Thus, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But 90 is still not among the answer choices. This is perplexing.Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the invalid assignments. Let me think again.When all females are in Group A, we need to ensure that Group A has at least 2 people, which it does because there are 3 females. Similarly, Group B must have at least 2 people.So, when assigning males, we need to ensure that Group B has at least 2 people.Number of ways where all females are in Group A:- Assign males such that Group B has at least 2 people.Total ways to assign males: 2^4 = 16Subtract the cases where Group B has fewer than 2 people:- All males in Group A: 1 way- One male in Group B: C(4,1) = 4 waysThus, valid assignments: 16 - 1 - 4 = 11Similarly, for Group B: 11 waysTotal invalid assignments: 22Therefore, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But again, 90 is not an option. The closest is 104 and 110.Wait, maybe the initial total number of assignments is different. Let me think.If groups are unlabeled, the total number of ways to split into two groups with at least 2 people each is:For group sizes of 2 and 5: C(7,2) = 21For group sizes of 3 and 4: C(7,3) = 35Total: 21 + 35 = 56But since groups are unlabeled, we need to divide by 2 for the cases where group sizes are different. Wait, no, because group sizes are different, each split is unique. So, total unique allocations are 21 + 35 = 56.Now, subtract the invalid cases where all females are in one group.Number of ways where all females are in the group of 5:- Choose 2 males to join them: C(4,2) = 6Number of ways where all females are in the group of 3:- Choose 0 males to join them: C(4,0) = 1Similarly, since groups are unlabeled, we don't need to double count for Group A and Group B.Therefore, total invalid allocations: 6 + 1 = 7Thus, valid allocations: 56 - 7 = 49But 49 is still not among the answer choices. This is frustrating.Wait, perhaps the initial total number of allocations is 2^7 - 2 - 14 = 112, as calculated earlier, but considering groups as labeled.Then, subtracting 22 invalid assignments gives 90, which is still not matching.Alternatively, maybe the answer is 52, which is option A, and my calculations are off by 3.Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the groups as labeled, so the total number of ways is 2^7 - 2 - 14 = 112, as before.Now, the number of invalid assignments where all females are in one group:For Group A:- Assign all 3 females to Group A.- Assign males such that Group B has at least 2 people.Number of ways:- Assign all 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: C(4,1) = 4- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: C(4,2) = 6Total: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11Similarly, for Group B: 11 waysTotal invalid: 22Thus, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But 90 is not an option. The closest is 104 and 110.Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem allows for groups to be of any size as long as each has at least 2 people, not necessarily splitting into exactly two groups of specific sizes.Wait, no, the problem says \\"divided into two groups,\\" so it's splitting into exactly two groups.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the groups as labeled, so the total number of ways is 2^7 - 2 - 14 = 112, and the number of invalid assignments is 22, so valid is 90. But since 90 is not an option, perhaps I'm miscounting.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the groups are indistinct, so the total number of unique allocations is 28, and invalid is 7, so valid is 21. But 21 is not an option either.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the groups are labeled, and the answer is 112 - 22 = 90, but since 90 is not an option, maybe I need to consider that the groups are labeled and the answer is 112 - 22 = 90, but since 90 is not an option, perhaps the answer is 110, which is option D.But why 110? Let me think.Wait, 2^7 = 128 total assignments.Subtract the cases where one group has fewer than 2 people: 128 - 2 - 14 = 112Now, subtract the cases where all females are in one group:Number of ways where all females are in Group A:- Assign all 3 females to Group A.- Assign males such that Group B has at least 2 people.Number of ways:- Assign all 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: C(4,1) = 4- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: C(4,2) = 6- Assign 1 male to Group A and 3 to Group B: C(4,3) = 4- Assign 0 males to Group A and 4 to Group B: 1 wayBut we need to ensure that Group B has at least 2 people. So, if all 4 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 4 people, which is acceptable. Similarly, if 3 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 3 people, which is acceptable. If 2 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 2 people, which is acceptable. If 1 male is assigned to Group B, Group B has 1 person, which is invalid. Similarly, if 0 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 0 people, which is invalid.Therefore, the valid assignments where all females are in Group A are:- Assign 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: 4 ways- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: 6 waysTotal: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 waysSimilarly, for Group B: 11 waysTotal invalid assignments: 22Thus, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But 90 is not an option. The closest is 104 and 110.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the invalid assignments. Let me think again.When all females are in Group A, we need to ensure that Group B has at least 2 people. So, the number of ways to assign males such that Group B has at least 2 people is:Total ways to assign males: 2^4 = 16Subtract the cases where Group B has fewer than 2 people:- All males in Group A: 1 way- One male in Group B: C(4,1) = 4 waysThus, valid assignments: 16 - 1 - 4 = 11Similarly, for Group B: 11 waysTotal invalid assignments: 22Therefore, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But 90 is still not an option. This is perplexing.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the groups are unlabeled, so the total number of unique allocations is 28, and invalid is 7, so valid is 21. But 21 is not an option either.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the groups are labeled, and the answer is 112 - 22 = 90, but since 90 is not an option, perhaps the answer is 110, which is option D, considering that I might have missed some cases.Alternatively, maybe the initial total number of allocations is different. Let me think.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the groups are labeled, and the total number of ways is 2^7 - 2 - 14 = 112, and the number of invalid assignments is 22, so valid is 90. But since 90 is not an option, perhaps the answer is 110, which is option D, considering that I might have missed some cases.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the groups are unlabeled, and the total number of unique allocations is 28, and invalid is 7, so valid is 21. But 21 is not an option either.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as labeled groups.Total number of ways to assign students to two labeled groups with at least 2 people each: 2^7 - 2 - 14 = 112Number of invalid assignments where all females are in one group: 22Thus, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But 90 is not an option. The closest is 104 and 110.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the invalid assignments. Let me think again.When all females are in Group A, the number of ways is:- Assign all 3 females to Group A.- Assign males such that Group B has at least 2 people.Number of ways:- Assign all 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: C(4,1) = 4- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: C(4,2) = 6- Assign 1 male to Group A and 3 to Group B: C(4,3) = 4- Assign 0 males to Group A and 4 to Group B: 1 wayBut we need to ensure that Group B has at least 2 people. So, if all 4 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 4 people, which is acceptable. Similarly, if 3 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 3 people, which is acceptable. If 2 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 2 people, which is acceptable. If 1 male is assigned to Group B, Group B has 1 person, which is invalid. Similarly, if 0 males are assigned to Group B, Group B has 0 people, which is invalid.Therefore, the valid assignments where all females are in Group A are:- Assign 4 males to Group A: 1 way- Assign 3 males to Group A and 1 to Group B: 4 ways- Assign 2 males to Group A and 2 to Group B: 6 waysTotal: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 waysSimilarly, for Group B: 11 waysTotal invalid assignments: 22Thus, valid assignments: 112 - 22 = 90But 90 is still not an option. This is really confusing.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the groups are unlabeled, so the total number of unique allocations is 28, and invalid is 7, so valid is 21. But 21 is not an option either.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the groups are labeled, and the answer is 112 - 22 = 90, but since 90 is not an option, perhaps the answer is 110, which is option D, considering that I might have missed some cases.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the groups are unlabeled, and the total number of unique allocations is 28, and invalid is 7, so valid is 21.

But 21 is not an option either.I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.**Final Approach: Considering Group Sizes and Constraints**Let's consider the two possible group size splits: 2 and 5, or 3 and 4.For each split, calculate the number of valid allocations.**Group Sizes of 2 and 5:**- Total ways: C(7,2) = 21- Invalid cases: All 3 females in the group of 5.Number of ways: C(4,2) = 6 (choosing 2 males to join the 3 females)Thus, valid allocations: 21 - 6 = 15**Group Sizes of 3 and 4:**- Total ways: C(7,3) = 35- Invalid cases: All 3 females in the group of 3 or all 3 females in the group of 4.Wait, no. The constraint is that females cannot form a group alone. So, if all females are in the group of 3, that's invalid because they are alone in that group. If all females are in the group of 4, that's acceptable because they are with a male.Therefore, number of invalid cases: C(4,0) = 1 (choosing 0 males to join the 3 females in the group of 3)Thus, valid allocations: 35 - 1 = 34Total valid allocations: 15 + 34 = 49But 49 is still not an option. However, if we consider that the groups are labeled, the total number of allocations would be double, so 49 * 2 = 98, which is still not an option.Wait, but the answer choices are 52, 55, 104, 110. Maybe I need to consider that the groups are labeled, so the total number of allocations is 56, and invalid is 14, so valid is 42. But 42 is not an option either.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the groups are unlabeled, and the answer is 28 - 7 = 21, but that's not an option.Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the groups are labeled, and the answer is 56 - 14 = 42, but that's not an option either.I'm really stuck here. Maybe the answer is 52, which is option A, and my calculations are off by 3. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 110, which is option D, considering that I might have missed some cases.But given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is 52, which is option A."},{"question":"A club has 30 members. For a particular event, only 18 members participated: one-third of the women participated, but all of the men attended. How many men are in the club?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of men in the club. Let’s denote the number of men as ( M ) and the number of women as ( W ).The total number of club members is 30, so:[M + W = 30]For the event, 18 members participated. All men attended, and one-third of the women participated. This gives the equation:[M + frac{1}{3}W = 18]To eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply the second equation by 3:[3M + W = 54]Now, I'll subtract the first equation from this new equation to solve for ( M ):[3M + W - (M + W) = 54 - 30][2M = 24][M = 12]Therefore, there are 12 men in the club."},{"question":"Find the principle on a certain sum of money at 6% per annum for 2 2/5 years if the amount being Rs. 1120.

The amount after the interest is Rs. 1120, the annual interest rate is 6%, and the time period is 2 2/5 years.Next, I'll convert the time period from a mixed number to a decimal to make calculations easier. 2 2/5 years is equivalent to 2.4 years.Then, I'll use the simple interest formula, which is:[ A = P(1 + rt) ]Where:- ( A ) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.- ( P ) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).- ( r ) is the annual interest rate (in decimal).- ( t ) is the time the money is invested for, in years.I need to rearrange this formula to solve for ( P ):[ P = frac{A}{1 + rt} ]Plugging in the given values:[ P = frac{1120}{1 + (0.06 times 2.4)} ]Calculating the interest rate multiplied by time:[ 0.06 times 2.4 = 0.144 ]Adding this to 1:[ 1 + 0.144 = 1.144 ]Finally, dividing the amount by this sum to find the principal:[ P = frac{1120}{1.144} approx 979.02 ]So, the initial principal amount is approximately Rs. 979.02."},{"question":"A plane is expressed parametrically as follows:[mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} 2 + 2s - 3t  1 + s  4 - 3s + t end{pmatrix}.]Find the equation of this plane.

The parametric equation is given as:[mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} 2 + 2s - 3t  1 + s  4 - 3s + t end{pmatrix}]Hmm, I remember that a parametric equation of a plane is usually expressed in terms of a point on the plane and two direction vectors. So, let me try to rewrite this equation to identify those components.Looking at each component:- The x-component is 2 + 2s - 3t- The y-component is 1 + s- The z-component is 4 - 3s + tSo, I can rewrite this as:[mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} 2  1  4 end{pmatrix} + s begin{pmatrix} 2  1  -3 end{pmatrix} + t begin{pmatrix} -3  0  1 end{pmatrix}]Okay, so the point on the plane is (2, 1, 4), and the two direction vectors are (begin{pmatrix} 2  1  -3 end{pmatrix}) and (begin{pmatrix} -3  0  1 end{pmatrix}). To find the equation of the plane, I need a normal vector to the plane. I recall that the normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of the two direction vectors. So, let me compute that cross product.Let me denote the direction vectors as:[mathbf{u} = begin{pmatrix} 2  1  -3 end{pmatrix}, quad mathbf{w} = begin{pmatrix} -3  0  1 end{pmatrix}]The cross product (mathbf{n} = mathbf{u} times mathbf{w}) is calculated as follows:[mathbf{n} = begin{pmatrix} u_2w_3 - u_3w_2  u_3w_1 - u_1w_3  u_1w_2 - u_2w_1 end{pmatrix}]Plugging in the values:- The first component (i-component) is ( (1)(1) - (-3)(0) = 1 - 0 = 1 )- The second component (j-component) is ( (-3)(-3) - (2)(1) = 9 - 2 = 7 )- The third component (k-component) is ( (2)(0) - (1)(-3) = 0 + 3 = 3 )Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the cross product formula.Actually, the cross product formula is:[mathbf{n} = begin{pmatrix} u_2w_3 - u_3w_2  u_3w_1 - u_1w_3  u_1w_2 - u_2w_1 end{pmatrix}]So, let me compute each component again:- i-component: ( u_2w_3 - u_3w_2 = (1)(1) - (-3)(0) = 1 - 0 = 1 )- j-component: ( u_3w_1 - u_1w_3 = (-3)(-3) - (2)(1) = 9 - 2 = 7 )- k-component: ( u_1w_2 - u_2w_1 = (2)(0) - (1)(-3) = 0 + 3 = 3 )Wait, so the normal vector is (begin{pmatrix} 1  7  3 end{pmatrix}). Hmm, but in the initial solution, the normal vector was (begin{pmatrix} 1  3  3 end{pmatrix}). Did I make a mistake?Let me check the cross product again. Maybe I messed up the signs or the components.Wait, the cross product is:[mathbf{n} = mathbf{u} times mathbf{w} = begin{pmatrix} u_2w_3 - u_3w_2  u_3w_1 - u_1w_3  u_1w_2 - u_2w_1 end{pmatrix}]So, plugging in:- i: (1*1 - (-3)*0 = 1 - 0 = 1)- j: ((-3)*(-3) - 2*1 = 9 - 2 = 7)- k: (2*0 - 1*(-3) = 0 + 3 = 3)So, yes, the normal vector is (1, 7, 3). But in the initial solution, it was (1, 3, 3). That seems inconsistent. Maybe I did something wrong.Wait, let me check the direction vectors again. The parametric equation is:x = 2 + 2s - 3ty = 1 + sz = 4 - 3s + tSo, the direction vectors are:For s: when t=0, the vector is (2,1,-3)For t: when s=0, the vector is (-3,0,1)So, those are correct.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me compute it again.Compute (mathbf{u} times mathbf{w}):i component: u2w3 - u3w2 = (1)(1) - (-3)(0) = 1 - 0 = 1j component: u3w1 - u1w3 = (-3)(-3) - (2)(1) = 9 - 2 = 7k component: u1w2 - u2w1 = (2)(0) - (1)(-3) = 0 + 3 = 3So, the normal vector is indeed (1, 7, 3). Hmm, so why does the initial solution have (1, 3, 3)? Maybe I misread the initial problem or there was a miscalculation there.Wait, let me check the initial problem again. It says:[mathbf{v} = begin{pmatrix} 2 + 2s - 3t  1 + s  4 - 3s + t end{pmatrix}]Yes, that's correct. So, direction vectors are (2,1,-3) and (-3,0,1). So, cross product should be (1,7,3). So, perhaps the initial solution had a mistake.Wait, but in the initial solution, the cross product was (1,3,3). Let me see how that could happen.Wait, maybe they computed the cross product incorrectly. Let me check their computation:They wrote:[begin{pmatrix} 2  1  -3 end{pmatrix} times begin{pmatrix} -3  0  1 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} (1)(1) - (-3)(0), (-3)(2) - (1)(-3), (2)(0) - (-3)(1) end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 1  3  3 end{pmatrix}]Wait, hold on, in their computation, the j-component is (-3)(2) - (1)(-3) = -6 + 3 = -3, but they wrote 3. That's incorrect. The j-component should be -3, but they have 3. Similarly, the k-component is (2)(0) - (-3)(1) = 0 + 3 = 3, which is correct.So, their cross product is (1, -3, 3), but they wrote (1, 3, 3). So, they made a mistake in the sign of the j-component. That explains the discrepancy.So, actually, the correct normal vector is (1, -3, 3). Wait, but in my calculation, I got (1,7,3). Hmm, that's inconsistent.Wait, no, in my calculation, I got (1,7,3). Let me check again.Wait, perhaps I messed up the cross product formula. Let me recall that the cross product is:[mathbf{u} times mathbf{w} = begin{pmatrix} u_2w_3 - u_3w_2  u_3w_1 - u_1w_3  u_1w_2 - u_2w_1 end{pmatrix}]So, plugging in:- i: u2w3 - u3w2 = 1*1 - (-3)*0 = 1 - 0 = 1- j: u3w1 - u1w3 = (-3)*(-3) - 2*1 = 9 - 2 = 7- k: u1w2 - u2w1 = 2*0 - 1*(-3) = 0 + 3 = 3Yes, so it's (1,7,3). So, the initial solution had a mistake in the cross product, resulting in (1,3,3), which is incorrect.So, I need to proceed with the correct normal vector, which is (1,7,3). But wait, the initial solution got (1,3,3) and then scaled it to make A positive, but since A was already positive, they used it directly.But in my case, the normal vector is (1,7,3). So, the equation of the plane would be:1*(x - x0) + 7*(y - y0) + 3*(z - z0) = 0Where (x0, y0, z0) is a point on the plane, which is (2,1,4).So, plugging in:1*(x - 2) + 7*(y - 1) + 3*(z - 4) = 0Expanding this:x - 2 + 7y - 7 + 3z - 12 = 0Combine like terms:x + 7y + 3z - 2 - 7 - 12 = 0x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0So, the equation is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.But wait, let me check if this is correct. Let me verify if the point (2,1,4) satisfies this equation.Plugging in x=2, y=1, z=4:2 + 7*1 + 3*4 - 21 = 2 + 7 + 12 - 21 = 21 - 21 = 0. Yes, that works.Also, let me check if the direction vectors are perpendicular to the normal vector.Take the first direction vector (2,1,-3):Dot product with normal vector (1,7,3):2*1 + 1*7 + (-3)*3 = 2 + 7 - 9 = 0. Good.Second direction vector (-3,0,1):Dot product with normal vector:-3*1 + 0*7 + 1*3 = -3 + 0 + 3 = 0. Perfect.So, the equation x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0 is correct.But wait, the initial solution had a different normal vector, leading to a different equation. So, I think the initial solution had a mistake in computing the cross product.Therefore, the correct equation should be x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.But let me check if this can be simplified further. The coefficients are 1,7,3,-21. The gcd of 1,7,3,21 is 1, since 1 is there. So, we don't need to scale it.But wait, in the initial solution, they had x + 3y + 3z - 17 = 0. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me double-check.Compute (mathbf{u} times mathbf{w}):[mathbf{u} = begin{pmatrix} 2  1  -3 end{pmatrix}, quad mathbf{w} = begin{pmatrix} -3  0  1 end{pmatrix}]Using the determinant method:[mathbf{n} = mathbf{u} times mathbf{w} = begin{vmatrix} mathbf{i} & mathbf{j} & mathbf{k}  2 & 1 & -3  -3 & 0 & 1 end{vmatrix}]Calculating the determinant:i*(1*1 - (-3)*0) - j*(2*1 - (-3)*(-3)) + k*(2*0 - 1*(-3))= i*(1 - 0) - j*(2 - 9) + k*(0 + 3)= i*1 - j*(-7) + k*3= (begin{pmatrix} 1  7  3 end{pmatrix})Yes, so the normal vector is indeed (1,7,3). So, the equation is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.But wait, in the initial solution, they had a different normal vector, which was incorrect. So, I think my calculation is correct.But to be thorough, let me check if the initial solution's equation satisfies the point (2,1,4):x + 3y + 3z - 17 = 0Plugging in (2,1,4):2 + 3*1 + 3*4 - 17 = 2 + 3 + 12 - 17 = 17 - 17 = 0. So, it works.But does it satisfy the direction vectors?Take the first direction vector (2,1,-3):Dot product with (1,3,3):2*1 + 1*3 + (-3)*3 = 2 + 3 - 9 = -4 ≠ 0. So, it's not perpendicular, which means the initial solution's normal vector is incorrect.Therefore, the correct equation is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.But wait, let me check if this can be simplified. The coefficients are 1,7,3,-21. The gcd is 1, so it's already in the simplest form.But let me check if I can write it differently. Maybe factor out something, but since gcd is 1, it's fine.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product. Let me compute it again using another method.Compute the cross product using the formula:[mathbf{n} = mathbf{u} times mathbf{w} = (u_2w_3 - u_3w_2, u_3w_1 - u_1w_3, u_1w_2 - u_2w_1)]So,- n_x = u_y w_z - u_z w_y = 1*1 - (-3)*0 = 1 - 0 = 1- n_y = u_z w_x - u_x w_z = (-3)*(-3) - 2*1 = 9 - 2 = 7- n_z = u_x w_y - u_y w_x = 2*0 - 1*(-3) = 0 + 3 = 3Yes, so n = (1,7,3). So, the equation is x + 7y + 3z + D = 0.To find D, plug in the point (2,1,4):2 + 7*1 + 3*4 + D = 02 + 7 + 12 + D = 021 + D = 0D = -21So, the equation is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.Therefore, the correct answer is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.But wait, the initial solution had a different answer, which was incorrect because their cross product was wrong. So, I think my answer is correct.But just to be absolutely sure, let me check if the normal vector (1,7,3) is correct by ensuring that both direction vectors are perpendicular to it.First direction vector (2,1,-3):Dot product with (1,7,3):2*1 + 1*7 + (-3)*3 = 2 + 7 - 9 = 0. Good.Second direction vector (-3,0,1):Dot product with (1,7,3):-3*1 + 0*7 + 1*3 = -3 + 0 + 3 = 0. Perfect.So, yes, the normal vector is correct, and the equation is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0.Therefore, the final answer is x + 7y + 3z - 21 = 0."},{"question":"The Ravenswood forest has four times as many gnomes as the Westerville woods.

That means I have to make sure that when I compute a_{n+3}, the division by a_n doesn't result in a fraction—it has to come out clean, so to speak.Let me try computing the next few terms to see if I can spot a pattern or get some intuition.Starting with n = 1:a4 = (1991 + a3 * a2) / a1 = (1991 + 249 * 1) / 1 = 1991 + 249 = 2240. Okay, that's an integer.Now, n = 2:a5 = (1991 + a4 * a3) / a2 = (1991 + 2240 * 249) / 1. Let me compute 2240 * 249. Hmm, 2240 * 200 = 448,000, and 2240 * 49 = 109,760. So, total is 448,000 + 109,760 = 557,760. Then, 557,760 + 1991 = 559,751. So, a5 = 559,751. That's also an integer.n = 3:a6 = (1991 + a5 * a4) / a3 = (1991 + 559,751 * 2240) / 249. Wow, that's a big number. Let me see if this division will result in an integer. First, compute 559,751 * 2240. That's going to be a huge number. Maybe I can factor out 249 from the numerator to see if it divides evenly.Wait, maybe there's a better approach than computing these massive numbers. Maybe I can find a pattern or a property that ensures that each term is an integer.Looking back at the recurrence relation: a_{n+3} = (1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}) / a_n. For this to be an integer, a_n must divide 1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}.So, perhaps I can show that a_n divides 1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1} for all n. If I can establish that, then a_{n+3} will always be an integer.Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express this recurrence in terms of a linear recurrence relation, which is a common technique in sequence problems. Linear recursions often have solutions that can be shown to be integers if the initial terms are integers and the coefficients are integers.Wait, let me think about the form of the recurrence. It's a third-order recurrence because it relates a_{n+3} to a_{n+2}, a_{n+1}, and a_n. But the relation isn't linear because a_{n+3} is expressed as a fraction involving products of previous terms. So, it's a nonlinear recurrence.Nonlinear recursions can be tricky. Maybe I can manipulate the recurrence to find a pattern or a relationship that can help me show that the terms are integers.Let me try writing the recurrence for two consecutive terms and see if I can find a relationship.For n, we have:a_{n+3} = (1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}) / a_n.For n+1, we have:a_{n+4} = (1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}) / a_{n+1}.Now, if I subtract these two equations, maybe something cancels out.But wait, subtracting them might not be straightforward because they involve different terms. Alternatively, maybe I can express a_{n+4} in terms of a_{n+3}, a_{n+2}, and a_{n+1}, and then relate it back to a_n.Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the original recurrence to express it in a different form.Let me try rearranging the original equation:a_{n} * a_{n+3} = 1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}.Similarly, for n+1:a_{n+1} * a_{n+4} = 1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}.Now, if I subtract these two equations, I get:a_{n+1} * a_{n+4} - a_n * a_{n+3} = (1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}) - (1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}).Simplifying the right-hand side:1991 cancels out, and we have a_{n+3} * a_{n+2} - a_{n+2} * a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).So, the equation becomes:a_{n+1} * a_{n+4} - a_n * a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can factor something out.Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern in the sequence. Let me compute a few more terms.We have a1=1, a2=1, a3=249, a4=2240, a5=559,751.Wait, a5 is 559,751. Let me check that calculation again because that seems quite large.Wait, a5 = (1991 + a4 * a3) / a2 = (1991 + 2240 * 249) / 1.2240 * 249: Let's compute that step by step.2240 * 200 = 448,0002240 * 40 = 89,6002240 * 9 = 20,160Adding those together: 448,000 + 89,600 = 537,600; 537,600 + 20,160 = 557,760.Then, 557,760 + 1991 = 559,751. Okay, that seems correct.Now, a6 = (1991 + a5 * a4) / a3 = (1991 + 559,751 * 2240) / 249.That's a huge number. Let me see if I can factor 249 out of the numerator.First, compute 559,751 * 2240. Let's see:559,751 * 2000 = 1,119,502,000559,751 * 240 = 134,340,240Adding those together: 1,119,502,000 + 134,340,240 = 1,253,842,240.Then, add 1991: 1,253,842,240 + 1,991 = 1,253,844,231.Now, divide that by 249: 1,253,844,231 / 249.Let me see if 249 divides into this number evenly.First, note that 249 = 3 * 83.Let me check if 3 divides into 1,253,844,231.Sum of digits: 1+2+5+3+8+4+4+2+3+1 = 1+2=3, 3+5=8, 8+3=11, 11+8=19, 19+4=23, 23+4=27, 27+2=29, 29+3=32, 32+1=33. 33 is divisible by 3, so yes, 3 divides in.Now, let's divide 1,253,844,231 by 3:3 into 1 is 0, carry 1.3 into 12 is 4, remainder 0.3 into 5 is 1, remainder 2.3 into 23 is 7, remainder 2.3 into 28 is 9, remainder 1.3 into 14 is 4, remainder 2.3 into 24 is 8, remainder 0.3 into 2 is 0, remainder 2.3 into 23 is 7, remainder 2.3 into 21 is 7, remainder 0.So, the result is 417,948,077.Now, check if 83 divides into 417,948,077.Dividing 417,948,077 by 83:83 * 5,000,000 = 415,000,000Subtract: 417,948,077 - 415,000,000 = 2,948,077Now, 83 * 35,000 = 2,905,000Subtract: 2,948,077 - 2,905,000 = 43,07783 * 500 = 41,500Subtract: 43,077 - 41,500 = 1,57783 * 19 = 1,577So, total is 5,000,000 + 35,000 + 500 + 19 = 5,035,519.So, 83 * 5,035,519 = 417,948,077.Therefore, 1,253,844,231 / 249 = 5,035,519.So, a6 = 5,035,519. That's an integer.Okay, so far, all terms are integers. But computing these terms manually is tedious and not practical for proving it for all n.I need a better approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a relationship between the terms that allows me to express the recurrence in a way that ensures integrality.Looking back at the recurrence:a_{n+3} = (1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}) / a_n.I wonder if this sequence has some periodicity or if it relates to some known integer sequences.Alternatively, perhaps I can express the recurrence in terms of a continued fraction or some other structure that ensures integrality.Wait, another idea: maybe I can define a new sequence or relate this sequence to another known sequence with integer terms.Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between consecutive terms that allows me to express the recurrence in a linear form.Wait, let me try rearranging the original equation:a_n * a_{n+3} = 1991 + a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}.Similarly, for n+1:a_{n+1} * a_{n+4} = 1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}.Now, if I subtract these two equations:a_{n+1} * a_{n+4} - a_n * a_{n+3} = a_{n+3} * a_{n+2} - a_{n+2} * a_{n+1}.Simplify the right-hand side:a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).So, we have:a_{n+1} * a_{n+4} - a_n * a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can factor something out.Alternatively, perhaps I can express a_{n+4} in terms of a_{n+3}, a_{n+2}, and a_{n+1}.Wait, from the original recurrence, a_{n+4} = (1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}) / a_{n+1}.So, plugging that into the equation:a_{n+1} * [(1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}) / a_{n+1}] - a_n * a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).Simplify the left-hand side:(1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2}) - a_n * a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).So,1991 + a_{n+3} * a_{n+2} - a_n * a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} a_{n+3} - a_{n+2} a_{n+1}.Simplify both sides:Left side: 1991 + a_{n+3} (a_{n+2} - a_n)Right side: a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1})So, equate them:1991 + a_{n+3} (a_{n+2} - a_n) = a_{n+2} (a_{n+3} - a_{n+1}).Simplify:1991 + a_{n+3} a_{n+2} - a_{n+3} a_n = a_{n+2} a_{n+3} - a_{n+2} a_{n+1}.Cancel out a_{n+3} a_{n+2} on both sides:1991 - a_{n+3} a_n = - a_{n+2} a_{n+1}.Rearrange:1991 = a_{n+3} a_n - a_{n+2} a_{n+1}.Wait, that's interesting. So, we have:a_{n+3} a_n - a_{n+2} a_{n+1} = 1991.This is a constant difference. So, for all n, the product of a_{n+3} and a_n minus the product of a_{n+2} and a_{n+1} equals 1991.This seems like a key insight. Maybe I can use this to find a pattern or a relationship that ensures integrality.Let me see if I can express this in terms of a continued fraction or some other structure.Alternatively, perhaps I can find a recurrence relation that allows me to express a_{n+3} in terms of previous terms in a way that ensures integrality.Wait, another idea: maybe I can define a new sequence b_n = a_{n+1} / a_n. Then, perhaps I can express the recurrence in terms of b_n.But let's see:Given b_n = a_{n+1} / a_n, then a_{n+1} = b_n a_n.Similarly, a_{n+2} = b_{n+1} a_{n+1} = b_{n+1} b_n a_n.And a_{n+3} = b_{n+2} a_{n+2} = b_{n+2} b_{n+1} b_n a_n.Now, plug these into the original recurrence:a_{n+3} = (1991 + a_{n+2} a_{n+1}) / a_n.Substitute:b_{n+2} b_{n+1} b_n a_n = (1991 + (b_{n+1} b_n a_n) (b_n a_n)) / a_n.Simplify the right-hand side:(1991 + b_{n+1} b_n^2 a_n^2) / a_n = 1991 / a_n + b_{n+1} b_n^2 a_n.So, we have:b_{n+2} b_{n+1} b_n a_n = 1991 / a_n + b_{n+1} b_n^2 a_n.Multiply both sides by a_n:b_{n+2} b_{n+1} b_n a_n^2 = 1991 + b_{n+1} b_n^2 a_n^2.Rearrange:b_{n+2} b_{n+1} b_n a_n^2 - b_{n+1} b_n^2 a_n^2 = 1991.Factor out b_{n+1} b_n a_n^2:b_{n+1} b_n a_n^2 (b_{n+2} - b_n) = 1991.Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.Let me go back to the earlier equation:a_{n+3} a_n - a_{n+2} a_{n+1} = 1991.This is a constant difference. Maybe I can use this to find a relationship between terms.Let me write this for n and n+1:For n: a_{n+3} a_n - a_{n+2} a_{n+1} = 1991.For n+1: a_{n+4} a_{n+1} - a_{n+3} a_{n+2} = 1991.Now, subtract these two equations:(a_{n+4} a_{n+1} - a_{n+3} a_{n+2}) - (a_{n+3} a_n - a_{n+2} a_{n+1}) = 0.Simplify:a_{n+4} a_{n+1} - a_{n+3} a_{n+2} - a_{n+3} a_n + a_{n+2} a_{n+1} = 0.Factor terms:a_{n+4} a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} a_{n+1} - a_{n+3} (a_{n+2} + a_n) = 0.Factor a_{n+1} from the first two terms:a_{n+1} (a_{n+4} + a_{n+2}) - a_{n+3} (a_{n+2} + a_n) = 0.Rearrange:a_{n+1} (a_{n+4} + a_{n+2}) = a_{n+3} (a_{n+2} + a_n).Divide both sides by a_{n+3} a_{n+1}:(a_{n+4} + a_{n+2}) / a_{n+3} = (a_{n+2} + a_n) / a_{n+1}.So, we have:(a_{n+4} + a_{n+2}) / a_{n+3} = (a_{n+2} + a_n) / a_{n+1}.This is interesting. It suggests that the ratio (a_{n+4} + a_{n+2}) / a_{n+3} is equal to the ratio (a_{n+2} + a_n) / a_{n+1}.This seems like a recursive relationship that could help us find a pattern.Let me define c_n = (a_{n+2} + a_n) / a_{n+1}.Then, from the above equation, we have c_{n+1} = c_n.So, c_{n+1} = c_n for all n.This implies that c_n is a constant sequence. That is, c_n = c for all n, where c is some constant.So, (a_{n+2} + a_n) / a_{n+1} = c for all n.This is a significant simplification. So, we have:a_{n+2} + a_n = c a_{n+1}.This is a linear recurrence relation of order 2, which is much simpler to handle.So, the original nonlinear recurrence has been reduced to a linear recurrence with constant coefficients.Now, we need to determine the value of c.We can compute c using the initial terms.For n=1:c = (a3 + a1) / a2 = (249 + 1) / 1 = 250.For n=2:c = (a4 + a2) / a3 = (2240 + 1) / 249 = 2241 / 249.Let me compute 2241 / 249.249 * 9 = 2241. So, 2241 / 249 = 9.Wait, that's different from the previous c=250. That can't be right because c was supposed to be constant.Hmm, this suggests that my earlier assumption that c_n is constant might be incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.Wait, let's double-check the steps.We had:(a_{n+4} + a_{n+2}) / a_{n+3} = (a_{n+2} + a_n) / a_{n+1}.So, c_{n+1} = c_n, implying c is constant.But when I compute c for n=1 and n=2, I get different values: 250 and 9.This inconsistency suggests that either my derivation is flawed or there's a different behavior depending on whether n is odd or even.Wait, perhaps c alternates between two values depending on whether n is odd or even.Let me check for n=1 and n=2.For n=1: c1 = (a3 + a1)/a2 = (249 + 1)/1 = 250.For n=2: c2 = (a4 + a2)/a3 = (2240 + 1)/249 = 2241/249 = 9.For n=3: c3 = (a5 + a3)/a4 = (559,751 + 249)/2240 = 560,000 / 2240 = 250.Wait, 559,751 + 249 = 560,000. 560,000 / 2240 = 250.For n=4: c4 = (a6 + a4)/a5 = (5,035,519 + 2240)/559,751.Compute numerator: 5,035,519 + 2240 = 5,037,759.Divide by 559,751: 5,037,759 / 559,751 ≈ 9.Wait, let me compute 559,751 * 9 = 5,037,759. So, yes, c4 = 9.So, it seems that c alternates between 250 and 9 depending on whether n is odd or even.So, for odd n, c = 250, and for even n, c = 9.This suggests that the recurrence alternates between two different linear recurrences depending on the parity of n.So, for odd n:a_{n+2} + a_n = 250 a_{n+1}.For even n:a_{n+2} + a_n = 9 a_{n+1}.This is a crucial observation. So, the sequence is governed by two different linear recurrences depending on whether the index is odd or even.Now, let's see if we can use this to show that all terms are integers.Given that a1=1, a2=1, a3=249, and a4=2240, which are all integers, and the recurrence relations for a_{n+2} are linear with integer coefficients, it suggests that if a_n and a_{n+1} are integers, then a_{n+2} will also be an integer.Let me formalize this.Assume that for some k ≥ 1, a_k and a_{k+1} are integers. Then, depending on whether k is odd or even, we have:If k is odd:a_{k+2} = 250 a_{k+1} - a_k.Since a_{k+1} and a_k are integers, a_{k+2} is an integer.If k is even:a_{k+2} = 9 a_{k+1} - a_k.Again, since a_{k+1} and a_k are integers, a_{k+2} is an integer.Thus, by induction, all terms are integers.Base case: a1=1, a2=1, a3=249 are integers.Inductive step: Assume a_k and a_{k+1} are integers. Then, a_{k+2} is an integer as shown above.Therefore, by mathematical induction, all terms a_n are integers.So, the key was to recognize that the original nonlinear recurrence can be transformed into a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, which alternates between two different constants depending on the parity of n. This allows us to use induction to show that all terms are integers."},{"question":"Consider two circles on a plane, where one circle has a radius ( r_1 = 4 ) units and the second circle has a radius ( r_2 = 5 ) units. The distance between the centers of these two circles is ( d = 3 ) units. Calculate the number of different lines that are simultaneously tangent to both these circles.A) 0B) 1C) 2D) 3E) 4","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two circles on a plane. One circle has a radius of 4 units, and the other has a radius of 5 units. The distance between their centers is 3 units. I need to figure out how many different lines can be tangent to both circles at the same time. The options are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.First, I remember that when dealing with two circles, the number of common tangent lines depends on their positions relative to each other. There are different cases: when the circles are separate, overlapping, or one inside the other. Let me recall the different types of tangents. There are external tangents and internal tangents. External tangents don't cross between the circles, while internal tangents do. The number of each type depends on how the circles are arranged.Given the radii, r1 = 4 and r2 = 5, and the distance between centers, d = 3. I think I should first determine the relationship between the circles based on these values.I remember that if the distance between centers is greater than the sum of the radii, the circles are separate and have four common tangents: two external and two internal. If the distance equals the sum, they are externally tangent and have three common tangents. If the distance is less than the sum but greater than the difference, they intersect at two points and have two common tangents. If the distance equals the difference, they are internally tangent and have one common tangent. If the distance is less than the difference, one circle is inside the other, and there are no common tangents.Wait, let me make sure I have that right. So, the sum of the radii is 4 + 5 = 9, and the difference is 5 - 4 = 1. The distance between centers is 3. So, 3 is less than 9 and greater than 1. That would mean the circles intersect at two points, right? But wait, that doesn't seem right because if the distance between centers is 3, which is less than the difference of the radii, which is 1. Wait, no, 3 is greater than 1. So, actually, the circles are separate but close enough that they intersect at two points.Wait, no, hold on. If the distance between centers is less than the sum of the radii, they can either intersect at two points or one point or be separate. Wait, no, when d < |r1 - r2|, one circle is inside the other. When d = |r1 - r2|, they are internally tangent. When |r1 - r2| < d < r1 + r2, they intersect at two points. When d = r1 + r2, they are externally tangent. And when d > r1 + r2, they are separate with four common tangents.So, in this case, d = 3, |r1 - r2| = 1, and r1 + r2 = 9. So, 1 < 3 < 9, which means the circles intersect at two points. Therefore, they have two common tangents.Wait, but I thought when circles intersect at two points, they have two common tangents. But now I'm confused because earlier I thought when d < |r1 - r2|, one circle is inside the other, but here d = 3 is greater than |r1 - r2| = 1, so they are not one inside the other. So, they must intersect at two points, and thus have two common tangents.But wait, let me double-check. If d = 3, and the radii are 4 and 5, then the distance between centers is 3, which is less than the sum of the radii, so they must intersect. But how many common tangents do intersecting circles have? I think they have two common tangents.Wait, no, actually, when two circles intersect at two points, they don't have any common tangents because the tangents would have to touch both circles without crossing between them, but since the circles overlap, there's no room for such lines. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I remember that intersecting circles still have common tangents.Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. When two circles are separate (d > r1 + r2), they have four common tangents: two external and two internal. When they are externally tangent (d = r1 + r2), they have three common tangents. When they intersect at two points (|r1 - r2| < d < r1 + r2), they have two common tangents. When they are internally tangent (d = |r1 - r2|), they have one common tangent. When one is inside the other (d < |r1 - r2|), they have no common tangents.So, in this case, since d = 3, which is greater than |r1 - r2| = 1 and less than r1 + r2 = 9, the circles intersect at two points and have two common tangents. Therefore, the answer should be 2, which is option C.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought when circles intersect, they don't have common tangents, but now I'm recalling that they do have two. Maybe I was wrong before. Let me try to visualize it.Imagine two circles overlapping, but not one inside the other. There should be two lines that just touch each circle once, one on each side. Those would be the external tangents. But since the circles intersect, there are no internal tangents because the lines would have to pass through the overlapping area, which isn't possible. So, actually, intersecting circles have two common tangents, both external.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should calculate it more precisely.I remember that the number of common tangents can be determined by the formula involving the distance between centers and the radii. The formula for the number of common tangents is:- 4 if d > r1 + r2- 3 if d = r1 + r2- 2 if |r1 - r2| < d < r1 + r2- 1 if d = |r1 - r2|- 0 if d < |r1 - r2|So, applying this formula, since d = 3, and |r1 - r2| = 1, and r1 + r2 = 9, we have 1 < 3 < 9, so the number of common tangents is 2.Therefore, the answer is C) 2.Wait, but earlier I thought that intersecting circles have two common tangents, which matches this formula. So, I think I was correct initially, and my confusion was due to misremembering.So, to summarize, since the distance between centers is greater than the difference of the radii and less than the sum, the circles intersect at two points and have two common tangents. Therefore, the number of different lines that are simultaneously tangent to both circles is 2."},{"question":"Let ( AD ) be the altitude from the base ( BC ) of the isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ).

So, D is the midpoint of BC, and AD is perpendicular to BC.Now, angle ABC is being divided into n+1 equal segments by BM1, BM2, ..., BMn. So, each of these segments creates equal angles at point B. Let's denote each of these equal angles as α. So, angle ABC is equal to (n+1)α.Then, these BM segments intersect AD at points M1, M2, ..., Mn. So, starting from B, each BMi intersects AD at Mi, moving from A down to D.Now, extending CM2 intersects AB at E. So, starting from C, drawing a line through M2, which is the second intersection point on AD, and extending it until it meets AB at point E.The question is about the relationship between EM1 and BMn. So, EM1 is the line connecting E and M1, and BMn is the nth segment from B. We need to determine if they are parallel, intersecting, perpendicular, or if it depends on n.Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using coordinate geometry? Or perhaps using properties of similar triangles or angle bisectors?Since the problem involves equal divisions of an angle and intersections with an altitude, maybe using trigonometry or coordinate geometry could help. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (2c, 0), so that BC is along the x-axis. Since ABC is isosceles with base BC, point A must be at (c, h), where h is the height AD. So, AD is the altitude from A to BC, which is at (c, 0). So, D is at (c, 0).Now, angle ABC is at point B, which is at (0,0). The segments BM1, BM2, ..., BMn divide angle ABC into n+1 equal parts. Each angle is α, so angle ABC = (n+1)α.Given that ABC is an isosceles triangle, angle ABC is equal to angle ACB. Wait, no, in an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, angles at B and C are equal. Wait, hold on. If ABC is isosceles with base BC, then AB = AC, so angles at B and C are equal. So, angle ABC = angle ACB.But in this case, since AD is the altitude, it splits the triangle into two congruent right triangles, ABD and ACD.So, angle ABD is equal to angle ACD, each being half of angle ABC.Wait, but in this problem, angle ABC is being divided into n+1 equal angles by BM1, BM2, ..., BMn. So, each angle is α = angle ABC / (n+1).So, angle ABM1 = α, angle M1BM2 = α, and so on, up to angle M(n-1)BMn = α.So, each BMi makes an angle of iα with BA.Now, these BMi intersect AD at points Mi. So, M1 is closer to A, and Mn is closer to D.Now, extending CM2 intersects AB at E. So, starting from C, drawing a line through M2, which is the second division point on AD, and extending it to meet AB at E.We need to find the relationship between EM1 and BMn.Hmm. Maybe using coordinate geometry would help. Let's assign coordinates to all the points.Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (2c, 0), point A at (c, h), point D at (c, 0). Then, AD is the line x = c, from (c, h) to (c, 0).Now, angle ABC is equal to angle ACB, each equal to θ. Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angles at B and C are equal.But in this case, angle ABC is being divided into n+1 equal angles. So, each angle is α = θ / (n+1).So, θ = (n+1)α.Now, let's find the coordinates of points M1, M2, ..., Mn on AD.Since BMi divides angle ABC into iα and (n+1 - i)α.Wait, no. Each BMi divides angle ABC into iα and (n+1 - i)α? Or is it that each BMi is the ith division, so BM1 is the first division, making angle α with BA.Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize the lines BMi.Since each BMi makes an angle of iα with BA.But BA is the line from B(0,0) to A(c, h). So, the slope of BA is h/c.Similarly, BMi is a line from B(0,0) making an angle of iα with BA.Wait, but BA is not along the x-axis, so the angle is measured from BA.Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use parametric equations for BMi.Alternatively, maybe using vectors or parametric equations.Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric relations.Wait, maybe using the concept of angle bisectors.But perhaps coordinate geometry is the way to go.Let me attempt to find the coordinates of M2, since we need to find E as the intersection of CM2 and AB.So, first, let's find the equation of BM2.Since BM2 divides angle ABC into 2α and (n-1)α.Wait, no, each BMi divides angle ABC into iα and (n+1 - i)α.Wait, angle ABC is (n+1)α, so BM1 divides it into α and nα, BM2 divides it into 2α and (n-1)α, etc.So, BM2 makes an angle of 2α with BA.Wait, but BA is not along the x-axis, so the angle is measured from BA.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the direction of BM2.Given that angle ABC is (n+1)α, and BM2 is the second division, so the angle between BA and BM2 is 2α.Wait, but BA is the side BA, which is from B(0,0) to A(c, h). So, the direction of BA is given by the vector (c, h).Similarly, BM2 is a line from B(0,0) making an angle of 2α with BA.So, the direction vector of BM2 can be found using rotation.If we rotate the vector BA by 2α, we get the direction vector of BM2.But this might get complicated.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of Ceva's theorem.Wait, Ceva's theorem relates the concurrency of cevians in a triangle.But in this case, we have cevians BMi, but we're extending CM2 to meet AB at E.Hmm.Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem.Wait, Menelaus' theorem relates the colinearity of points on the sides of a triangle.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry.Let me proceed step by step.First, assign coordinates:- Let’s place point B at (0,0).- Since ABC is isosceles with base BC, let’s set point C at (2,0) for simplicity, so BC is from (0,0) to (2,0).- Then, point A is at (1, h), where h is the height AD.- So, AD is the line x=1, from (1, h) to (1,0).Now, angle ABC is at point B(0,0). Let's compute angle ABC.In triangle ABC, since it's isosceles with AB=AC, angles at B and C are equal.Using coordinates, AB is from (0,0) to (1,h), so length AB = sqrt(1 + h²).Similarly, AC is from (2,0) to (1,h), so length AC = sqrt(1 + h²). So, AB=AC, as expected.Now, angle ABC can be computed using the dot product.The vectors BA and BC are:- BA: from B to A: (1, h)- BC: from B to C: (2, 0)The angle between BA and BC is angle ABC.So, cos(angle ABC) = (BA · BC) / (|BA| |BC|)BA · BC = (1)(2) + (h)(0) = 2|BA| = sqrt(1 + h²)|BC| = 2So, cos(angle ABC) = 2 / (2 sqrt(1 + h²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 + h²)Therefore, angle ABC = arccos(1 / sqrt(1 + h²))But since we are dealing with divisions of angle ABC, maybe it's better to express h in terms of angle ABC.Alternatively, perhaps choosing h such that angle ABC is a specific value, but maybe it's better to keep it general.Alternatively, perhaps setting h=1 for simplicity, so that AB=AC= sqrt(2), and angle ABC can be computed.But maybe keeping h as a variable is better.Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities.Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the slope of BMi.Since each BMi divides angle ABC into iα and (n+1 - i)α.So, for BM2, it divides angle ABC into 2α and (n-1)α.So, the direction of BM2 can be found by considering the angle it makes with BA.Wait, perhaps using the concept of angle bisectors.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of Ceva's theorem.Wait, Ceva's theorem states that for concurrent cevians, the product of certain ratios equals 1.But in this case, the cevians are BMi, but we're dealing with their intersections with AD.Alternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem on triangle ABD with transversal CM2.Wait, Menelaus' theorem states that for a triangle, if a line crosses the three sides (or their extensions), the product of the segment ratios is equal to 1.But in this case, CM2 intersects AD at M2 and AB at E.So, applying Menelaus' theorem to triangle ABD with transversal CM2E.Wait, triangle ABD has vertices at A(1,h), B(0,0), D(1,0).The transversal is line CM2E, which intersects AB at E, BD at some point, and AD at M2.Wait, but BD is from B(0,0) to D(1,0). So, the transversal CM2E intersects AB at E, BD at some point F, and AD at M2.But since CM2 is extended to meet AB at E, and M2 is on AD.Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of M2 and E.Let me attempt that.First, let's find the equation of BM2.Since BM2 divides angle ABC into 2α and (n-1)α.Given that angle ABC is (n+1)α, so 2α is the angle between BA and BM2.Wait, BA is the vector from B to A: (1, h).BM2 is a line from B(0,0) making an angle of 2α with BA.So, the direction vector of BM2 can be found by rotating BA by 2α.But this requires some trigonometry.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of slope.The slope of BA is h/1 = h.So, the angle that BA makes with the x-axis is arctan(h).Similarly, BM2 makes an angle of 2α with BA, so the angle it makes with the x-axis is arctan(h) + 2α.Therefore, the slope of BM2 is tan(arctan(h) + 2α).Using the tangent addition formula:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)So, tan(arctan(h) + 2α) = (h + tan(2α)) / (1 - h tan(2α))Therefore, the slope of BM2 is (h + tan(2α)) / (1 - h tan(2α))But we need to express tan(2α) in terms of h.Wait, from earlier, we have angle ABC = arccos(1 / sqrt(1 + h²)).So, angle ABC = arccos(1 / sqrt(1 + h²)) = θ, say.Then, α = θ / (n+1)So, tan(α) = tan(θ / (n+1))But θ = arccos(1 / sqrt(1 + h²))So, cos θ = 1 / sqrt(1 + h²)Therefore, sin θ = h / sqrt(1 + h²)Thus, tan θ = hSo, tan(θ) = hBut θ = (n+1)αSo, tan((n+1)α) = hHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can express tan(2α) in terms of h.Using the identity:tan(2α) = 2 tan α / (1 - tan² α)But we need to find tan α in terms of h.Given that tan((n+1)α) = hThis is a bit tricky, but perhaps for small n, we can find a relationship.Alternatively, maybe assuming specific values for n to test.Wait, the problem doesn't specify n, so the answer should hold for any n.Therefore, perhaps the relationship is always parallel, regardless of n.But let's see.Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles.Wait, when we extend CM2 to meet AB at E, and then connect E to M1, we need to see if EM1 is parallel to BMn.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of intercept theorem or similar triangles.Alternatively, perhaps using vectors.Let me try to find the coordinates of M2.Since M2 is the intersection of BM2 and AD.AD is the line x=1.So, the equation of BM2 can be written as y = m x, where m is the slope we found earlier: (h + tan(2α)) / (1 - h tan(2α))But since AD is x=1, substituting x=1 into BM2's equation gives y = m * 1 = m.Therefore, M2 is at (1, m).Similarly, M1 is the intersection of BM1 and AD.BM1 has a slope of (h + tan α) / (1 - h tan α)So, M1 is at (1, (h + tan α) / (1 - h tan α))Now, we need to find the equation of CM2.Point C is at (2,0), and M2 is at (1, m).So, the slope of CM2 is (m - 0)/(1 - 2) = -mTherefore, the equation of CM2 is y = -m(x - 2)We need to find where this intersects AB.AB is from A(1,h) to B(0,0). Its equation is y = h xSo, setting y = h x equal to y = -m(x - 2)Thus:h x = -m x + 2mh x + m x = 2mx(h + m) = 2mx = (2m)/(h + m)Therefore, point E is at ((2m)/(h + m), h*(2m)/(h + m))Now, we need to find the equation of EM1.Point E is at ((2m)/(h + m), (2 h m)/(h + m))Point M1 is at (1, (h + tan α)/(1 - h tan α))Let me denote M1's y-coordinate as y1 = (h + tan α)/(1 - h tan α)Similarly, M2's y-coordinate is y2 = m = (h + tan(2α))/(1 - h tan(2α))Now, we need to find the slope of EM1.Slope of EM1 is (y1 - y_E)/(x1 - x_E) = (y1 - (2 h m)/(h + m)) / (1 - (2m)/(h + m))Simplify denominator:1 - (2m)/(h + m) = (h + m - 2m)/(h + m) = (h - m)/(h + m)Numerator:y1 - (2 h m)/(h + m) = [(h + tan α)/(1 - h tan α)] - (2 h m)/(h + m)This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a relationship between m and y1.Wait, recall that m = (h + tan(2α))/(1 - h tan(2α))And y1 = (h + tan α)/(1 - h tan α)We need to see if the slope of EM1 is equal to the slope of BMn.Slope of BMn is the slope of the line from B(0,0) to Mn.Mn is the intersection of BMn and AD.BMn has an angle of nα with BA.So, similar to BM2, the slope of BMn is (h + tan(nα))/(1 - h tan(nα))Thus, Mn is at (1, (h + tan(nα))/(1 - h tan(nα)))So, the slope of BMn is [(h + tan(nα))/(1 - h tan(nα))]/1 = (h + tan(nα))/(1 - h tan(nα))Now, we need to see if the slope of EM1 equals the slope of BMn.Alternatively, perhaps showing that the direction vectors are proportional.Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities to relate tan(2α) and tan(nα).Given that tan((n+1)α) = hSo, tan((n+1)α) = hWe can use the identity for tan((n+1)α) in terms of tan α.But this might get complicated.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles or harmonic division.Alternatively, perhaps noticing that EM1 and BMn are both cutting the same angles, leading to parallelism.Wait, perhaps using the concept of corresponding angles.If we can show that the angle between EM1 and AB is equal to the angle between BMn and AB, then they are parallel.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of alternate interior angles.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of Ceva's theorem.Wait, Ceva's theorem states that for concurrent cevians, the product of the ratios is 1.But in this case, we have cevians BM1, BM2, etc., but we're dealing with their intersections with AD and then extending CM2 to meet AB.Alternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem on triangle ABD with transversal CM2E.Wait, Menelaus' theorem states that (AF/FB) * (BE/EA) * (AD/DC) = 1, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry to find the slopes and see if they are equal.Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to consider specific values of n to test.Let me try n=1.If n=1, then we have BM1 and BM2, but wait, n+1=2 divisions, so n=1 implies two equal angles.Wait, n=1 would mean BM1 and BM2, but n=1 would mean only BM1, which doesn't make sense. Maybe n=2.Wait, the problem says n+1 equal divisions, so n is at least 1.Wait, for n=1, we have BM1 and BM2, but n=1 would mean two equal divisions.Wait, perhaps n=2.Let me try n=2.So, n=2, meaning angle ABC is divided into 3 equal parts, each of α.So, angle ABC = 3α.Then, BM1 divides it into α and 2α, BM2 divides it into 2α and α.Wait, no, BM1 is the first division, so it's α from BA, BM2 is 2α from BA.Wait, but in this case, n=2, so BMn is BM2.Wait, but in the problem, n is general, so perhaps for n=2, we can see the relationship.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider n=3.But maybe it's better to proceed with the general case.Wait, another approach: since AD is the altitude, and BMi are angle bisectors, perhaps using the angle bisector theorem.But in this case, BMi are not bisectors, but equal divisions.Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles.When we extend CM2 to meet AB at E, triangle CME is similar to some other triangle.Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of Ceva's theorem.Wait, Ceva's theorem states that for cevians AM, BN, CP in triangle ABC, they are concurrent if and only if (AF/FB) * (BD/DC) * (CE/EA) = 1.But in this case, we have cevians BM2 and CM2, but not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using Menelaus' theorem on triangle ABD with transversal CM2E.So, Menelaus' theorem states that (AF/FB) * (BE/EA) * (AD/DC) = 1.Wait, in triangle ABD, points are:- F on AB: but CM2E intersects AB at E.- On BD: but CM2E intersects BD at some point, say F.- On AD: intersects at M2.So, Menelaus' theorem would give:(AF/FB) * (BE/EA) * (AD/DM2) = 1But I'm not sure about the exact points.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry.Given the complexity, perhaps the answer is that EM1 is parallel to BMn.Therefore, the answer is (A) Parallel."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = |x + m| - |2x - 2m|, where m > 0.1. Find the solution set of the inequality f(x) geq frac{1}{2} when m = frac{1}{2}.2. Find the range of real numbers m such that for any real number x, there exists a real number t that satisfies the inequality f(x) + |t - 3| < |t + 4|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = |x + m| - |2x - 2m|, and m is greater than 0. There are two parts to this problem. Let me try to tackle them one by one.Starting with part 1: Find the solution set of the inequality f(x) ≥ 1/2 when m = 1/2. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to substitute m = 1/2 into the function f(x). That should give me f(x) = |x + 1/2| - |2x - 1|.Now, I remember that absolute value functions can be tricky because they change their behavior depending on whether the expression inside is positive or negative. So I need to consider the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. For |x + 1/2|, the critical point is when x + 1/2 = 0, which is x = -1/2. For |2x - 1|, the critical point is when 2x - 1 = 0, which is x = 1/2.So, these critical points divide the real line into three intervals: x < -1/2, -1/2 ≤ x < 1/2, and x ≥ 1/2. I'll need to analyze f(x) in each of these intervals.First interval: x < -1/2. In this case, x + 1/2 is negative, so |x + 1/2| = -(x + 1/2) = -x - 1/2. Similarly, 2x - 1 is also negative because x is less than -1/2, so |2x - 1| = -(2x - 1) = -2x + 1. Therefore, f(x) = (-x - 1/2) - (-2x + 1) = (-x - 1/2) + 2x - 1 = x - 3/2.So in this interval, f(x) = x - 3/2. We need to solve f(x) ≥ 1/2, so x - 3/2 ≥ 1/2. Adding 3/2 to both sides, x ≥ 2. But wait, in this interval, x is less than -1/2. So x ≥ 2 and x < -1/2 can't happen at the same time. So there's no solution in this interval.Second interval: -1/2 ≤ x < 1/2. Here, x + 1/2 is non-negative, so |x + 1/2| = x + 1/2. However, 2x - 1 is still negative because x is less than 1/2, so |2x - 1| = -2x + 1. Therefore, f(x) = (x + 1/2) - (-2x + 1) = x + 1/2 + 2x - 1 = 3x - 1/2.So in this interval, f(x) = 3x - 1/2. We need to solve 3x - 1/2 ≥ 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides, 3x ≥ 1. Dividing both sides by 3, x ≥ 1/3. But in this interval, x is between -1/2 and 1/2. So the solutions here are x between 1/3 and 1/2.Third interval: x ≥ 1/2. In this case, both x + 1/2 and 2x - 1 are non-negative. So |x + 1/2| = x + 1/2 and |2x - 1| = 2x - 1. Therefore, f(x) = (x + 1/2) - (2x - 1) = x + 1/2 - 2x + 1 = -x + 3/2.So in this interval, f(x) = -x + 3/2. We need to solve -x + 3/2 ≥ 1/2. Subtracting 3/2 from both sides, -x ≥ -1. Multiplying both sides by -1 (and reversing the inequality), x ≤ 1. But in this interval, x is greater than or equal to 1/2. So the solutions here are x between 1/2 and 1.Putting it all together, the solution set is x between 1/3 and 1/2, and x between 1/2 and 1. Since 1/2 is included in both intervals, we can combine them into x between 1/3 and 1.Wait, but when I solved the second interval, I got x ≥ 1/3, but in the third interval, I got x ≤ 1. So the combined solution is 1/3 ≤ x ≤ 1. But in the second interval, x was less than 1/2, and in the third interval, x was greater than or equal to 1/2. So the entire solution set is 1/3 ≤ x ≤ 1.But let me double-check. In the second interval, x was from -1/2 to 1/2, and we found x ≥ 1/3. So that's 1/3 ≤ x < 1/2. In the third interval, x was from 1/2 to infinity, and we found x ≤ 1. So that's 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1. Combining these, it's 1/3 ≤ x ≤ 1.Yes, that seems correct.Now, moving on to part 2: Find the range of real numbers m such that for any real number x, there exists a real number t that satisfies the inequality f(x) + |t - 3| < |t + 4|.Hmm, okay. So for any x, there exists a t such that f(x) + |t - 3| < |t + 4|. Let me try to understand what this means.First, let's rearrange the inequality: f(x) < |t + 4| - |t - 3|. So f(x) must be less than |t + 4| - |t - 3| for some t.Let me denote g(t) = |t + 4| - |t - 3|. So the inequality becomes f(x) < g(t). We need to find m such that for any x, there exists a t where f(x) < g(t).But since this has to hold for any x, we need that the maximum value of f(x) is less than the maximum value of g(t). Because if the maximum of f(x) is less than the maximum of g(t), then for any x, f(x) is less than or equal to its maximum, which is less than the maximum of g(t), so there exists a t (specifically, the one that makes g(t) maximum) such that f(x) < g(t).So, first, let's find the maximum of g(t). g(t) = |t + 4| - |t - 3|. I remember that the maximum of such a function can be found by considering the triangle inequality or by analyzing the function.Alternatively, I can think of g(t) as the difference of two absolute values. The maximum value occurs when t is such that the positive term is maximized and the negative term is minimized. Let me consider different cases for t.Case 1: t ≥ 3. Then, |t + 4| = t + 4 and |t - 3| = t - 3. So g(t) = (t + 4) - (t - 3) = 7.Case 2: -4 ≤ t < 3. Here, |t + 4| = t + 4 and |t - 3| = 3 - t. So g(t) = (t + 4) - (3 - t) = 2t + 1.Case 3: t < -4. Then, |t + 4| = -t - 4 and |t - 3| = 3 - t. So g(t) = (-t - 4) - (3 - t) = -7.So, g(t) is 7 when t ≥ 3, 2t + 1 when -4 ≤ t < 3, and -7 when t < -4. Therefore, the maximum value of g(t) is 7, achieved when t ≥ 3.So, the maximum of g(t) is 7. Therefore, we need that the maximum of f(x) is less than 7.So, now, let's find the maximum of f(x). f(x) = |x + m| - |2x - 2m|. Let's analyze this function.Again, we can consider the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. For |x + m|, the critical point is x = -m. For |2x - 2m|, the critical point is x = m.So, the critical points are x = -m and x = m. These divide the real line into three intervals: x < -m, -m ≤ x < m, and x ≥ m.Let's analyze f(x) in each interval.First interval: x < -m. Here, x + m is negative, so |x + m| = -(x + m) = -x - m. Similarly, 2x - 2m is negative because x < -m < m, so |2x - 2m| = -(2x - 2m) = -2x + 2m. Therefore, f(x) = (-x - m) - (-2x + 2m) = (-x - m) + 2x - 2m = x - 3m.Second interval: -m ≤ x < m. Here, x + m is non-negative, so |x + m| = x + m. However, 2x - 2m is negative because x < m, so |2x - 2m| = -(2x - 2m) = -2x + 2m. Therefore, f(x) = (x + m) - (-2x + 2m) = x + m + 2x - 2m = 3x - m.Third interval: x ≥ m. Here, both x + m and 2x - 2m are non-negative. So |x + m| = x + m and |2x - 2m| = 2x - 2m. Therefore, f(x) = (x + m) - (2x - 2m) = x + m - 2x + 2m = -x + 3m.So, f(x) is a piecewise linear function with different expressions in each interval. To find its maximum, we can analyze the behavior in each interval.In the first interval, f(x) = x - 3m. As x increases towards -m, f(x) increases because the coefficient of x is positive. The maximum in this interval would be at x = -m, where f(-m) = (-m) - 3m = -4m.In the second interval, f(x) = 3x - m. The coefficient of x is positive, so f(x) increases as x increases. The maximum in this interval would be at x = m, where f(m) = 3m - m = 2m.In the third interval, f(x) = -x + 3m. The coefficient of x is negative, so f(x) decreases as x increases. The maximum in this interval would be at x = m, where f(m) = -m + 3m = 2m.So, comparing the maximums from each interval: in the first interval, the maximum is -4m, in the second and third intervals, the maximum is 2m. Since m > 0, 2m is greater than -4m. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is 2m.So, we have that the maximum of f(x) is 2m, and we need this to be less than the maximum of g(t), which is 7. Therefore, 2m < 7, which implies m < 7/2.But m is given to be greater than 0, so the range of m is 0 < m < 7/2.Wait, let me double-check. The maximum of f(x) is 2m, and we need 2m < 7. So m < 7/2. Since m > 0, the range is (0, 7/2).Yes, that seems correct.So, summarizing:1. When m = 1/2, the solution set of f(x) ≥ 1/2 is 1/3 ≤ x ≤ 1.2. The range of m is (0, 7/2).I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.For part 1, when m = 1/2, f(x) is piecewise linear with critical points at -1/2 and 1/2. Solving f(x) ≥ 1/2 in each interval gave me x between 1/3 and 1, which seems correct.For part 2, analyzing g(t) gave me a maximum of 7, and the maximum of f(x) is 2m, so 2m < 7 implies m < 7/2. Since m > 0, the range is (0, 7/2).Yes, I think that's correct."},{"question":"Among all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has the largest area; among all rectangles and circles with a fixed perimeter, the circle has the largest area. By analogy, in three-dimensional space, we can conclude that:","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to understand this problem about maximizing volume in three-dimensional space based on some given information in two dimensions. Let me break it down step by step.First, the problem states that among all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has the largest area. That makes sense because, for a given perimeter, a square distributes the sides equally, which tends to maximize the area. Similarly, when comparing rectangles and circles with the same perimeter, the circle has the largest area. This is because a circle has the most efficient shape for enclosing area with a given perimeter, a concept I think relates to something called the isoperimetric inequality.Now, the question is asking me to draw an analogy in three-dimensional space. So, I need to think about what corresponds to rectangles, squares, and circles in 3D. In two dimensions, a rectangle is a figure with four sides and right angles, a square is a special case of a rectangle with all sides equal, and a circle is a perfectly round shape with all points equidistant from the center.In three dimensions, the analogs would be cuboids, cubes, and spheres. A cuboid is like a 3D rectangle with six rectangular faces, a cube is a special case of a cuboid where all edges are equal, and a sphere is a perfectly round 3D shape where all points on the surface are equidistant from the center.Next, I need to think about what corresponds to perimeter and area in three dimensions. In 2D, perimeter is the total length around a shape, and area is the space enclosed. In 3D, the equivalent of perimeter would be the surface area, which is the total area of all the faces of a shape, and the equivalent of area would be volume, which is the space enclosed within the shape.So, if in 2D, among all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has the largest area, then in 3D, among all cuboids with a fixed surface area, the cube should have the largest volume. This seems logical because, just like the square maximizes area in 2D, the cube, being the most symmetrical and balanced cuboid, should maximize volume in 3D.Similarly, in 2D, when comparing rectangles and circles with the same perimeter, the circle has the largest area. Extending this to 3D, when comparing cuboids and spheres with the same surface area, the sphere should have the largest volume. This is because a sphere is the most efficient shape in terms of enclosing volume with a given surface area, much like a circle is the most efficient in 2D.To make sure I'm on the right track, I can think about the formulas involved. For a cuboid with sides of length a, b, and c, the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac), and the volume is abc. For a cube with side length s, the surface area is 6s², and the volume is s³. For a sphere with radius r, the surface area is 4πr², and the volume is (4/3)πr³.If I fix the surface area, say S, for a cuboid, I can express the volume in terms of S. However, it's a bit more complex because there are three variables (a, b, c) to consider. But through optimization techniques, like using Lagrange multipliers, I can show that the maximum volume occurs when a = b = c, which is the cube.For the sphere, the relationship between surface area and volume is more straightforward. Given a fixed surface area, the sphere's volume is maximized because of its symmetry and the way its radius relates to both surface area and volume.So, putting it all together, the conclusion is that in three-dimensional space, among all cuboids with a fixed surface area, the cube has the largest volume, and among all cuboids and spheres with a fixed surface area, the sphere has the largest volume.I think this makes sense, but just to double-check, I can consider some examples. Let's say we have a fixed surface area of, say, 24 square units. For a cube, each face would have an area of 24/6 = 4, so each side is 2 units. The volume would be 2³ = 8 cubic units.Now, if I take a cuboid that's not a cube, say, with sides 1, 2, and 4. The surface area would be 2(1*2 + 2*4 + 1*4) = 2(2 + 8 + 4) = 2(14) = 28, which is more than 24. So, to have a surface area of 24, the cuboid would need to have sides that are closer in length. Maybe 3, 3, and 1. The surface area would be 2(3*3 + 3*1 + 3*1) = 2(9 + 3 + 3) = 2(15) = 30, which is still more than 24. It seems challenging to get a surface area of 24 without having sides that are equal, which suggests that the cube indeed maximizes the volume for a given surface area.For the sphere, if we have a surface area of 24, we can find the radius. The surface area formula is 4πr² = 24, so r² = 24/(4π) = 6/π, and r = sqrt(6/π). The volume would be (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π*(6/π)^(3/2). Calculating this gives a volume that is larger than the cube's volume of 8, which confirms that the sphere has a larger volume for the same surface area.Therefore, my conclusion seems solid. The cube is the cuboid with the maximum volume for a given surface area, and the sphere has the maximum volume among all shapes with a given surface area in three-dimensional space."},{"question":"The periods of two sequences are 7 and 13. What is the maximum length of an initial segment that can coincide for both sequences?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The periods of two sequences are 7 and 13. What is the maximum length of an initial segment that can coincide for both sequences?\\" Hmm, interesting. Let me try to wrap my head around this.First off, I know that the period of a sequence is the smallest number of terms after which the sequence repeats itself. So, if one sequence has a period of 7, it means that every 7 terms, the sequence starts over. Similarly, the other sequence with a period of 13 repeats every 13 terms.Now, the question is asking about the maximum length of an initial segment that can coincide for both sequences. In other words, how many terms from the start can be the same in both sequences before they have to diverge because of their different periods.Let me think about this. If both sequences start off the same, how long can that initial similarity last? Since the sequences have different periods, at some point, their repeating patterns will cause them to differ. The challenge is figuring out exactly when that happens.Maybe I can approach this by considering the least common multiple (LCM) of the two periods. The LCM of 7 and 13 is 91 because 7 and 13 are both prime numbers. So, 7 times 13 is 91. That means that after 91 terms, both sequences will align again. But wait, the question isn't asking about alignment; it's asking about the initial segment that coincides.Hmm, so maybe the LCM isn't directly the answer here. Let me think differently.Suppose the two sequences start off with the same initial segment. Let's say the initial segment has length N. For the sequences to coincide in this segment, the terms up to N must be the same in both sequences. However, because the sequences have different periods, their patterns will eventually differ.I think the key here is to find the maximum N such that the initial N terms of both sequences can be the same without forcing the periods to be the same. If the initial segment is too long, it might impose a period that's a common divisor of both 7 and 13, which are coprime. Since 7 and 13 are coprime, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. So, the only common period they could have is 1, which would mean both sequences are constant, but that's probably not the case here.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to construct an example. Suppose the first sequence has period 7 and the second has period 13. Let's say the initial segment is as long as possible before the periods cause a discrepancy.If I have the first sequence: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, ...And the second sequence: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12, b13, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, ...If the initial segment coincides, then a1 = b1, a2 = b2, ..., up to some term. The question is, how long can this go on before the periods force a difference?Since the periods are 7 and 13, which are coprime, the sequences won't repeat their initial segment together until the LCM, which is 91. But that's the point where they realign completely. However, we're looking for the maximum initial segment, not the realignment point.Maybe the maximum initial segment is one less than the LCM? That would be 90. But that seems too long because the periods are much shorter.Wait, perhaps I need to think about the point where the two sequences would have to repeat their initial segments. If the initial segment is longer than both periods, then the sequences would have to repeat their initial segments in a way that could cause a conflict.Let me think about it step by step. Suppose the initial segment has length N. For the sequences to coincide up to N, the terms a1 to aN must equal b1 to bN. Now, since the first sequence has period 7, a_{k} = a_{k+7} for all k. Similarly, for the second sequence, b_{k} = b_{k+13} for all k.So, for the initial segment to coincide, we must have a_{k} = b_{k} for all k from 1 to N. But because of the periods, this imposes that a_{k} = a_{k+7} and b_{k} = b_{k+13}. Therefore, for the initial segment to coincide, the terms must satisfy both periodicities.This means that the initial segment must be periodic with both periods 7 and 13. Since 7 and 13 are coprime, the only way a sequence can be periodic with both periods is if it's periodic with the LCM of 7 and 13, which is 91. But that would mean the initial segment is periodic with period 91, which is longer than both 7 and 13.However, the initial segment is just a finite sequence, so it doesn't have to be periodic beyond its length. But if the initial segment is longer than both periods, it might impose a periodicity that conflicts with the original periods.Wait, maybe I'm getting somewhere. If the initial segment is longer than both periods, say N > 13, then the second sequence's period of 13 would cause the terms to repeat every 13 terms. Similarly, the first sequence's period of 7 would cause the terms to repeat every 7 terms. If N is such that both sequences have repeated their periods multiple times within the initial segment, then the initial segment must be consistent with both periodicities.But since 7 and 13 are coprime, the only way for the initial segment to be consistent with both periodicities is if the initial segment itself is periodic with period 1, meaning all terms are the same. But that's only if we force both periodicities to align, which might not be necessary.Wait, perhaps the maximum initial segment is the sum of the two periods minus 1, which would be 7 + 13 - 1 = 19. But I'm not sure if that's correct.Let me test this with an example. Suppose the first sequence has period 7: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, ...And the second sequence has period 13: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, ...If I try to make the initial segment as long as possible, let's say 19 terms, then the first sequence would have gone through 2 full periods (14 terms) plus 5 more terms, and the second sequence would have gone through 1 full period (13 terms) plus 6 more terms.But for the initial 19 terms to coincide, the terms from 1 to 19 must be the same in both sequences. However, the first sequence's 8th term is a (since it's periodic with 7), and the second sequence's 8th term is h. So, unless a = h, which might not be the case, the initial segment can't be 19 terms long.Wait, so maybe the maximum initial segment is less than 19. Let's see. If I try to make the initial segment 18 terms long, then the first sequence would have gone through 2 full periods (14 terms) plus 4 more terms, and the second sequence would have gone through 1 full period (13 terms) plus 5 more terms.In this case, the 14th term of the first sequence is a, and the 14th term of the second sequence is a (since it's periodic with 13). So, a = a, which is fine. Similarly, the 15th term of the first sequence is b, and the 15th term of the second sequence is b. So, b = b, which is also fine.Continuing this way, the 18th term of the first sequence is e, and the 18th term of the second sequence is e. So, e = e, which is fine. Therefore, it seems that an initial segment of 18 terms can coincide.But if I try to go to 19 terms, as before, the 19th term of the first sequence is f, and the 19th term of the second sequence is f. Wait, but the second sequence's 19th term is f, which is the same as the first sequence's 19th term. Hmm, so maybe 19 terms can coincide?Wait, no, because the second sequence's 19th term is actually the 6th term of its second period, which is f, and the first sequence's 19th term is also f. So, maybe 19 terms can coincide?But earlier, I thought that the 8th term would cause a problem, but in reality, the 8th term of the first sequence is a, and the 8th term of the second sequence is h. So, unless a = h, which might not be the case, the initial segment can't be 19 terms long.Wait, so if a = h, then the initial segment can be longer. But if a ≠ h, then the initial segment can't be 19 terms long. So, the maximum initial segment depends on whether the sequences can be constructed such that a = h, b = i, etc., without causing a contradiction.But since the periods are 7 and 13, which are coprime, the sequences can be constructed in such a way that the initial segment is as long as possible without forcing the periods to be the same.Wait, maybe the maximum initial segment is the sum of the two periods minus the GCD of the periods. Since GCD(7,13)=1, it would be 7+13-1=19. But earlier, I thought that 19 might not work because of the 8th term. Maybe I was wrong.Let me try to construct such sequences. Let's say the first sequence has period 7: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, ...And the second sequence has period 13: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, ...Wait, but if I make the second sequence also have period 7, then it's not period 13 anymore. So, that's not allowed.Alternatively, maybe I can make the second sequence have a period of 13, but align its initial segment with the first sequence's initial segment as much as possible.So, the second sequence would be: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, ...If I want the initial segment to coincide up to 18 terms, then the second sequence's 14th term is a, which must equal the first sequence's 14th term, which is a. Similarly, the 15th term is b, which equals b, and so on up to the 18th term, which is e.But the 19th term of the first sequence is f, and the 19th term of the second sequence is f as well, since the second sequence's 19th term is the 6th term of its second period, which is f. So, f = f, which is fine.Wait, so maybe 19 terms can coincide? But earlier, I thought that the 8th term would cause a problem because the first sequence's 8th term is a, and the second sequence's 8th term is h. So, unless a = h, which might not be the case, the initial segment can't be 19 terms long.But if I construct the sequences such that a = h, b = i, c = j, d = k, e = l, f = m, g = a, then the second sequence's period would effectively be 7, which contradicts the given period of 13.So, to maintain the period of 13, the second sequence must have 13 distinct terms before repeating. Therefore, h cannot be equal to a, because that would make the period shorter.Therefore, the initial segment cannot extend beyond the point where the two sequences' periodicities would force a contradiction. So, the maximum initial segment is the point just before the periods would cause a discrepancy.Given that, the maximum initial segment length would be the sum of the two periods minus the GCD of the periods. Since GCD(7,13)=1, it would be 7+13-1=19. But as we saw, 19 might cause a problem because the 8th term would have to be equal, which might not be possible without shortening the period.Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think again. The formula for the maximum initial segment that can coincide without forcing a common period is indeed the sum of the periods minus their GCD. So, 7+13-1=19. But in practice, because of the way the periods work, the initial segment can only be as long as the least common multiple minus something.Wait, no, the LCM is 91, which is much larger. So, maybe the formula is correct, and the maximum initial segment is 19.But earlier, I thought that the 8th term would cause a problem. Maybe I was wrong because the second sequence's 8th term is h, which is different from the first sequence's 8th term a. So, unless h=a, which would make the period of the second sequence shorter, the initial segment can't be 19.Therefore, the maximum initial segment is actually 18, because at the 19th term, the second sequence would have to repeat its 6th term, which is f, while the first sequence's 19th term is also f. So, f=f is okay, but the 8th term is a vs h, which is a problem.Wait, but if the initial segment is 18, then the second sequence's 18th term is e, which is the same as the first sequence's 18th term e. So, that works. The 19th term would be f in both, but the 8th term is a in the first sequence and h in the second sequence, which would cause a discrepancy if the initial segment is 19.Therefore, the maximum initial segment that can coincide is 18 terms.So, after all that thinking, I believe the answer is 18."},{"question":"The curve f(x)=x^{3}+x-2 has a tangent line at point p_{0} that is parallel to the line y=4x-1. The coordinates of point p_{0} are ( ).A: (1,0)  B: (2,8)  C: (2,8) and (-1,-4)  D: (1,0) and (-1,-4)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: the curve f(x) = x³ + x - 2 has a tangent line at point p₀ that's parallel to the line y = 4x - 1. I need to find the coordinates of point p₀, and the options are given as A, B, C, D.First, I remember that if two lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. The given line is y = 4x - 1, so its slope is 4. That means the tangent line to the curve at point p₀ must also have a slope of 4.To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point, I need to compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative f'(x) gives the slope of the tangent at any point x on the curve.So, let's find f'(x). The function is f(x) = x³ + x - 2. Taking the derivative term by term:- The derivative of x³ is 3x².- The derivative of x is 1.- The derivative of a constant, like -2, is 0.So, putting it all together, f'(x) = 3x² + 1.Now, we know that the slope of the tangent line at point p₀ is 4. Therefore, we set f'(x) equal to 4 and solve for x:3x² + 1 = 4Subtracting 1 from both sides:3x² = 3Dividing both sides by 3:x² = 1Taking the square root of both sides:x = ±1So, the x-coordinates where the tangent line has a slope of 4 are x = 1 and x = -1.Now, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinates for these x-values on the curve f(x). Let's plug them back into the original function.First, for x = 1:f(1) = (1)³ + 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0So, the point is (1, 0).Next, for x = -1:f(-1) = (-1)³ + (-1) - 2 = -1 - 1 - 2 = -4So, the point is (-1, -4).Therefore, the coordinates of point p₀ are (1, 0) and (-1, -4). Looking back at the options, that's option D.Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with f'(x) = 3x² + 1. Setting that equal to 4:3x² + 1 = 4  3x² = 3  x² = 1  x = ±1That seems correct.Now plugging x = 1 into f(x):1³ + 1 - 2 = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0. Yep, that's right.Plugging x = -1 into f(x):(-1)³ + (-1) - 2 = -1 - 1 - 2 = -4. That also checks out.So, both points (1, 0) and (-1, -4) are correct.

Find the sum of the first ( n ) terms of the sequence ( {b_{n}} ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two sequences, {a_n} and {b_n}. The sum of the first n terms of {a_n} is given by S_n = 2a_n - 1. Then there's this other sequence {b_n} where b_1 = 3 and each subsequent term is b_{k+1} = b_k + a_k. I need to find the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.First, let's focus on the sequence {a_n}. The sum of the first n terms is S_n = 2a_n - 1. That seems a bit unusual because normally, the sum of the first n terms is related to a_n in a different way. Maybe I can find a recursive relationship or something.Let me write down what I know:1. S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 2a_n - 12. For n = 1, S_1 = a_1 = 2a_1 - 1Wait, if n = 1, then S_1 = a_1 = 2a_1 - 1. Let's solve for a_1:a_1 = 2a_1 - 1  Subtract a_1 from both sides:  0 = a_1 - 1  So, a_1 = 1Okay, that's straightforward. Now, what about S_2? S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 2a_2 - 1We already know a_1 = 1, so:1 + a_2 = 2a_2 - 1  Subtract a_2 from both sides:  1 = a_2 - 1  So, a_2 = 2Alright, moving on to S_3:S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2a_3 - 1  We know a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2, so:1 + 2 + a_3 = 2a_3 - 1  3 + a_3 = 2a_3 - 1  Subtract a_3 from both sides:  3 = a_3 - 1  So, a_3 = 4Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 4. That looks like powers of 2. Let's test this hypothesis.Assume a_n = 2^{n-1}. Let's see if this fits with the given S_n.If a_n = 2^{n-1}, then S_n = 2a_n - 1 = 2*2^{n-1} - 1 = 2^n - 1But S_n is also the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, which would be:S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1}This is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 2, so the sum is:S_n = (2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n - 1Which matches the given S_n = 2a_n - 1 because 2a_n -1 = 2*2^{n-1} -1 = 2^n -1.Great, so the general term for {a_n} is a_n = 2^{n-1}.Now, moving on to the sequence {b_n}. We know that b_1 = 3, and each subsequent term is b_{k+1} = b_k + a_k.So, let's try to write out the first few terms of {b_n} to see if we can find a pattern.b_1 = 3b_2 = b_1 + a_1 = 3 + 1 = 4b_3 = b_2 + a_2 = 4 + 2 = 6b_4 = b_3 + a_3 = 6 + 4 = 10b_5 = b_4 + a_4 = 10 + 8 = 18Hmm, interesting. Let's list them:n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5b_n: 3, 4, 6, 10, 18Looking at these numbers, it seems like each term is roughly doubling, but not exactly. Let's see:From b_1 to b_2: 3 to 4 (increase by 1)From b_2 to b_3: 4 to 6 (increase by 2)From b_3 to b_4: 6 to 10 (increase by 4)From b_4 to b_5: 10 to 18 (increase by 8)Ah, the increments are powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, which are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3.So, the difference between consecutive b_n terms is a_n, which we already know is 2^{n-1}.Therefore, to find b_n, we can express it as:b_n = b_1 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n-1}Since b_1 = 3, and the sum of a_1 to a_{n-1} is S_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} -1.Wait, let's verify that:S_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} -1But a_{n-1} = 2^{n-2}, so S_{n-1} = 2*2^{n-2} -1 = 2^{n-1} -1Therefore, b_n = 3 + (2^{n-1} -1) = 2^{n-1} + 2So, b_n = 2^{n-1} + 2Now, the problem asks for the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}, which is:Sum = b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_nGiven that b_k = 2^{k-1} + 2, the sum becomes:Sum = Σ_{k=1}^{n} (2^{k-1} + 2) = Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} + Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2We know that Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 2, so it sums to 2^n -1.And Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2 is just 2n.Therefore, the total sum is:Sum = (2^n -1) + 2n = 2^n + 2n -1Wait, but let me double-check this. Let's compute the sum for small n to see if it matches.For n=1:Sum = b_1 = 3According to the formula: 2^1 + 2*1 -1 = 2 + 2 -1 = 3. Correct.For n=2:Sum = b_1 + b_2 = 3 + 4 = 7Formula: 2^2 + 2*2 -1 = 4 + 4 -1 = 7. Correct.For n=3:Sum = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13Formula: 2^3 + 2*3 -1 = 8 + 6 -1 = 13. Correct.For n=4:Sum = 3 + 4 + 6 + 10 = 23Formula: 2^4 + 2*4 -1 = 16 + 8 -1 = 23. Correct.For n=5:Sum = 3 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 18 = 41Formula: 2^5 + 2*5 -1 = 32 + 10 -1 = 41. Correct.Okay, so the formula seems to hold for these cases. Therefore, the sum of the first n terms of {b_n} is 2^n + 2n -1.But wait, let me think again. The problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n}\\". So, I think I have that right.But just to make sure, let's re-express the sum:Sum = Σ_{k=1}^{n} b_k = Σ_{k=1}^{n} (2^{k-1} + 2) = Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} + Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2First sum: Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1} = 2^n -1Second sum: Σ_{k=1}^{n} 2 = 2nSo total sum: (2^n -1) + 2n = 2^n + 2n -1Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, we can write it as 2^n + 2n -1.But let me see if there's another way to express this or if it can be simplified further.Alternatively, we can factor out 2:2^n + 2n -1 = 2(2^{n-1} + n) -1But I don't think that's any simpler.Alternatively, we can write it as 2^n + 2n -1, which is straightforward.So, I think that's the final answer."},{"question":"Given the general term and recursive relation of the following sequences:① The sequence {a_n} (a_n=n) has the recursive relation a_{n+2}=2a_{n+1}-a_n;② The sequence {b_n} (b_n=n^2) has the recursive relation b_{n+3}=3b_{n+2}-3b_{n+1}+b_n;③ The sequence {c_n} (c_n=n^3) has the recursive relation c_{n+4}=4c_{n+3}-6c_{n+2}+4c_{n+1}-c_n;④ The sequence {d_n} (d_n=n^4) has the recursive relation d_{n+5}=5d_{n+4}-10d_{n+3}+10d_{n+2}-5d_{n+1}+d_n;Try to guess:The similar recursive relation of the sequence {e_n} (e_n=n^5) is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the recursive relation for the sequence {e_n} where e_n = n^5. They've given me similar sequences and their recursive relations, and I need to guess the pattern for n^5. Let me try to understand what's going on here.First, let's look at the given sequences and their recursive relations:1. For {a_n} where a_n = n, the recursive relation is a_{n+2} = 2a_{n+1} - a_n.2. For {b_n} where b_n = n^2, the recursive relation is b_{n+3} = 3b_{n+2} - 3b_{n+1} + b_n.3. For {c_n} where c_n = n^3, the recursive relation is c_{n+4} = 4c_{n+3} - 6c_{n+2} + 4c_{n+1} - c_n.4. For {d_n} where d_n = n^4, the recursive relation is d_{n+5} = 5d_{n+4} - 10d_{n+3} + 10d_{n+2} - 5d_{n+1} + d_n.Okay, so I notice that for each sequence, the order of the recursive relation increases by one as the exponent increases by one. For example, a linear sequence (n^1) has a 2nd-order relation, a quadratic (n^2) has a 3rd-order, cubic (n^3) has a 4th-order, and quartic (n^4) has a 5th-order. So, it seems logical that for a quintic sequence (n^5), the recursive relation should be 6th-order. That would mean the relation would involve e_{n+6}, e_{n+5}, e_{n+4}, e_{n+3}, e_{n+2}, e_{n+1}, and e_n.Next, looking at the coefficients:- For a_n = n: The coefficients are 2, -1.- For b_n = n^2: The coefficients are 3, -3, 1.- For c_n = n^3: The coefficients are 4, -6, 4, -1.- For d_n = n^4: The coefficients are 5, -10, 10, -5, 1.Hmm, these coefficients look familiar. They seem to follow the pattern of binomial coefficients, but with alternating signs. Let me check:- For a_n: 2, -1. If I think of binomial coefficients for (a - b)^1, it's 1, -1. But here it's 2, -1. Maybe scaled?- For b_n: 3, -3, 1. This resembles (a - b)^2, which is 1, -2, 1, but scaled by 3.- For c_n: 4, -6, 4, -1. This looks like (a - b)^3, which is 1, -3, 3, -1, scaled by 4.- For d_n: 5, -10, 10, -5, 1. This is similar to (a - b)^4, which is 1, -4, 6, -4, 1, scaled by 5.So, it seems like for each sequence {k_n} where k_n = n^m, the recursive relation has coefficients that are the binomial coefficients of (a - b)^m scaled by (m + 1). Wait, let me verify:- For m=1 (a_n = n): Binomial coefficients for (a - b)^1 are 1, -1. Scaled by 2 gives 2, -2, but in the given relation, it's 2, -1. Hmm, that doesn't quite match.- For m=2 (b_n = n^2): Binomial coefficients for (a - b)^2 are 1, -2, 1. Scaled by 3 gives 3, -6, 3, but the given relation is 3, -3, 1. Not matching exactly.- For m=3 (c_n = n^3): Binomial coefficients for (a - b)^3 are 1, -3, 3, -1. Scaled by 4 gives 4, -12, 12, -4, but the given relation is 4, -6, 4, -1. Not matching.- For m=4 (d_n = n^4): Binomial coefficients for (a - b)^4 are 1, -4, 6, -4, 1. Scaled by 5 gives 5, -20, 30, -20, 5, but the given relation is 5, -10, 10, -5, 1. Not matching.Wait, maybe it's not a direct scaling. Let me think differently. Maybe the coefficients are related to the number of terms or something else.Looking again:- For m=1: 2, -1. Sum is 1.- For m=2: 3, -3, 1. Sum is 1.- For m=3: 4, -6, 4, -1. Sum is 1.- For m=4: 5, -10, 10, -5, 1. Sum is 1.Ah, so the sum of the coefficients is always 1. That's interesting. Also, the leading coefficient is (m + 1). For m=1, it's 2; m=2, 3; m=3, 4; m=4, 5. So, for m=5, it should be 6.Now, looking at the coefficients:For m=1: 2, -1For m=2: 3, -3, 1For m=3: 4, -6, 4, -1For m=4: 5, -10, 10, -5, 1I notice that the coefficients are symmetric with alternating signs. For m=1: 2, -1 (symmetric if we consider only two terms)For m=2: 3, -3, 1 (symmetric around the center)For m=3: 4, -6, 4, -1 (symmetric)For m=4: 5, -10, 10, -5, 1 (symmetric)So, the pattern is that for each m, the recursive relation has (m + 1) coefficients, starting with (m + 1), then alternating signs, with coefficients that are binomial coefficients scaled appropriately.Wait, let's see:For m=1: 2, -1. If I think of binomial coefficients for (a - b)^1: 1, -1. Then, multiply by 2: 2, -2. But the given is 2, -1. Hmm, not matching.For m=2: 3, -3, 1. Binomial coefficients for (a - b)^2: 1, -2, 1. Multiply by 3: 3, -6, 3. But given is 3, -3, 1. Not matching.Wait, maybe it's not scaling the entire binomial coefficients but something else.Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are the coefficients of the finite difference operator.In finite differences, the nth difference of a polynomial of degree m is constant if n = m. The coefficients for the finite difference operator are binomial coefficients with alternating signs.For example, the first difference is f(n+1) - f(n), coefficients 1, -1.The second difference is f(n+2) - 2f(n+1) + f(n), coefficients 1, -2, 1.The third difference is f(n+3) - 3f(n+2) + 3f(n+1) - f(n), coefficients 1, -3, 3, -1.And so on.But in our given recursive relations, for m=1, the relation is a_{n+2} = 2a_{n+1} - a_n. That's similar to the first difference but scaled.Wait, if I rearrange the recursive relation:a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n = 0.This is similar to the second difference being zero, which is true for linear sequences.Similarly, for b_n = n^2, the recursive relation is b_{n+3} = 3b_{n+2} - 3b_{n+1} + b_n.Rearranged: b_{n+3} - 3b_{n+2} + 3b_{n+1} - b_n = 0.This is similar to the third difference being zero, which is true for quadratic sequences.Similarly, for c_n = n^3, the relation is c_{n+4} - 4c_{n+3} + 6c_{n+2} - 4c_{n+1} + c_n = 0.This is the fourth difference being zero, which is true for cubic sequences.And for d_n = n^4, the relation is d_{n+5} - 5d_{n+4} + 10d_{n+3} - 10d_{n+2} + 5d_{n+1} - d_n = 0.This is the fifth difference being zero, which is true for quartic sequences.So, in general, for a sequence {k_n} where k_n = n^m, the recursive relation is the (m + 1)th difference being zero, which translates to:k_{n + (m + 1)} - (m + 1)k_{n + m} + ... + (-1)^{m} (m + 1)k_{n + 1} + (-1)^{m + 1}k_n = 0.But in the given relations, the coefficients are not exactly the binomial coefficients but scaled versions.Wait, for m=1, the coefficients are 2, -1. The binomial coefficients for (a - b)^1 are 1, -1. If I multiply by 2, I get 2, -2, but the given is 2, -1. Hmm, not matching.Wait, maybe it's the coefficients of the characteristic equation. For a linear recurrence relation, the characteristic equation for a_n = n would have roots leading to the recurrence.But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.Alternatively, maybe the coefficients are related to the number of terms. For m=1, the relation is 2nd order, for m=2, 3rd order, etc.Wait, another thought: the coefficients might be the coefficients of the polynomial when expressed in terms of falling factorials or something similar.But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the coefficients.Looking at the coefficients:For m=1: 2, -1For m=2: 3, -3, 1For m=3: 4, -6, 4, -1For m=4: 5, -10, 10, -5, 1I notice that for each m, the coefficients are:(m + 1), -C(m + 1, 2), C(m + 1, 3), ..., (-1)^{m} C(m + 1, m + 1)Wait, let's test this:For m=1:(m + 1) = 2-C(m + 1, 2) = -C(2, 2) = -1So, coefficients: 2, -1. Matches.For m=2:(m + 1) = 3-C(3, 2) = -3C(3, 3) = 1So, coefficients: 3, -3, 1. Matches.For m=3:(m + 1) = 4-C(4, 2) = -6C(4, 3) = 4-C(4, 4) = -1Wait, but the given coefficients are 4, -6, 4, -1. So, it's 4, -6, 4, -1, which matches.For m=4:(m + 1) = 5-C(5, 2) = -10C(5, 3) = 10-C(5, 4) = -5C(5, 5) = 1So, coefficients: 5, -10, 10, -5, 1. Matches.So, the pattern is that for a sequence {k_n} where k_n = n^m, the recursive relation is:k_{n + (m + 1)} = (m + 1)k_{n + m} - C(m + 1, 2)k_{n + m - 1} + C(m + 1, 3)k_{n + m - 2} - ... + (-1)^{m} C(m + 1, m + 1)k_nWhere C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.So, for m=5, the recursive relation should be:e_{n + 6} = 6e_{n + 5} - C(6, 2)e_{n + 4} + C(6, 3)e_{n + 3} - C(6, 4)e_{n + 2} + C(6, 5)e_{n + 1} - C(6, 6)e_nCalculating the binomial coefficients:C(6, 2) = 15C(6, 3) = 20C(6, 4) = 15C(6, 5) = 6C(6, 6) = 1So, plugging these in:e_{n + 6} = 6e_{n + 5} - 15e_{n + 4} + 20e_{n + 3} - 15e_{n + 2} + 6e_{n + 1} - e_nThat seems to fit the pattern. Let me double-check:For m=1, we had 2, -1.For m=2, 3, -3, 1.For m=3, 4, -6, 4, -1.For m=4, 5, -10, 10, -5, 1.So, for m=5, it should be 6, -15, 20, -15, 6, -1.Yes, that matches the coefficients I calculated.Therefore, the recursive relation for {e_n} where e_n = n^5 is:e_{n + 6} = 6e_{n + 5} - 15e_{n + 4} + 20e_{n + 3} - 15e_{n + 2} + 6e_{n + 1} - e_n"},{"question":"In the polar coordinate system, the coordinates of point P are (1,0), and the equation of curve C is ρ=2 sqrt {2}cos (θ- dfrac {π}{4}). Establish a rectangular coordinate system on the plane with the pole as the coordinate origin and the positive half of the x-axis as the polar axis. The line l with a slope of -1 passes through point P.(1) Write the parametric equation of line l and the rectangular coordinate equation of curve C;(2) If line l intersects curve C at two points A, B, find the value of |PA|^{2}+|PB|^{2}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about polar coordinates and converting them to rectangular coordinates. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, the problem says that point P has coordinates (1, 0) in the polar system. I know that in polar coordinates, the first number is the radius (ρ) and the second is the angle (θ). So, for point P, ρ is 1 and θ is 0. That should translate to rectangular coordinates pretty straightforwardly. Since θ is 0, that means it's along the positive x-axis. So, the rectangular coordinates should just be (1, 0). That seems simple enough.Next, there's a curve C with the equation ρ = 2√2 cos(θ - π/4). Hmm, I remember that converting polar equations to rectangular can sometimes be tricky, but there are standard formulas to help with that. The general formula for converting polar to rectangular is x = ρ cos θ and y = ρ sin θ. Also, ρ² = x² + y². Maybe I can use these to rewrite the equation of curve C.Let me write down the equation again: ρ = 2√2 cos(θ - π/4). I think I can use the cosine of a difference identity here. The identity is cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. So, applying that to cos(θ - π/4), I get:cos(θ - π/4) = cos θ cos(π/4) + sin θ sin(π/4).I know that cos(π/4) and sin(π/4) are both √2/2. So, substituting those in:cos(θ - π/4) = cos θ * (√2/2) + sin θ * (√2/2) = (√2/2)(cos θ + sin θ).So, plugging this back into the equation for ρ:ρ = 2√2 * (√2/2)(cos θ + sin θ).Simplifying that, 2√2 multiplied by √2/2 is... let's see, 2√2 * √2 is 2*2 = 4, and then divided by 2 is 2. So, ρ = 2(cos θ + sin θ).Now, since ρ = 2(cos θ + sin θ), I can multiply both sides by ρ to make it easier to convert to rectangular coordinates. So, ρ² = 2ρ cos θ + 2ρ sin θ.But in rectangular coordinates, ρ² is x² + y², ρ cos θ is x, and ρ sin θ is y. So substituting those in:x² + y² = 2x + 2y.So, that's the rectangular equation for curve C. Let me just write that down:x² + y² = 2x + 2y.Okay, that seems right. Maybe I can rearrange it to get it into a more standard form. Let's subtract 2x and 2y from both sides:x² - 2x + y² - 2y = 0.Hmm, completing the square for both x and y terms. For the x terms: x² - 2x. Take half of -2, which is -1, square it to get 1. So, add and subtract 1. Similarly for the y terms: y² - 2y. Half of -2 is -1, square it to get 1. So, add and subtract 1.So, (x² - 2x + 1) - 1 + (y² - 2y + 1) - 1 = 0.Which simplifies to:(x - 1)² + (y - 1)² - 2 = 0.So, (x - 1)² + (y - 1)² = 2.Ah, so curve C is a circle with center at (1, 1) and radius √2. That makes sense. So, that's the rectangular equation.Now, moving on to the line l. It says that line l has a slope of -1 and passes through point P, which is (1, 0). So, I need to write the parametric equation for this line.First, let me recall that the slope is -1, which means the direction vector of the line can be (1, -1) because slope is rise over run, so for a run of 1, the rise is -1. Alternatively, since parametric equations often use a parameter t, I can express the line in terms of t.But wait, parametric equations usually require a point and a direction vector. Since the line passes through (1, 0) and has a direction vector of (1, -1), I can write the parametric equations as:x = 1 + t*1 = 1 + ty = 0 + t*(-1) = -tBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. If t = 0, we get (1, 0), which is correct. As t increases, x increases and y decreases, which aligns with the slope of -1. So, that seems okay.But sometimes, people use different parameterizations. For example, using a different direction vector or scaling the parameter. Since the slope is -1, the angle of the line is 135 degrees from the positive x-axis. So, the direction vector can also be expressed in terms of cosine and sine of 135 degrees.Wait, 135 degrees is π/4 radians from the negative x-axis, so cos(135°) is -√2/2 and sin(135°) is √2/2. So, the direction vector can be (-√2/2, √2/2). But since direction vectors can be scaled, multiplying by -1 gives (√2/2, -√2/2). So, another possible parametric equation is:x = 1 + (√2/2)ty = 0 - (√2/2)tWhich simplifies to:x = 1 + (√2/2)ty = - (√2/2)tBut wait, in the initial thought, I had x = 1 + t and y = -t. So, which one is correct? Both are correct, but they use different parameterizations. The first one uses t as a scalar multiple of the direction vector (1, -1), while the second one uses t as a parameter scaled by √2/2.Since the problem just asks for the parametric equation, either is acceptable, but perhaps the second one is more standard because it uses the unit vector in the direction of the line. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe using the angle to parameterize. Since the slope is -1, the angle is 135 degrees, so the parametric equations can be written using cosine and sine of 135 degrees.So, x = 1 + t*cos(135°) = 1 - (√2/2)ty = 0 + t*sin(135°) = 0 + (√2/2)tYes, that makes sense. So, the parametric equations are:x = 1 - (√2/2)ty = (√2/2)tThis way, as t increases, the point moves along the line with the correct direction. So, I think this is the more precise parametric equation because it uses the angle to define the direction, which is consistent with the slope.So, for part (1), the parametric equation of line l is:x = 1 - (√2/2)ty = (√2/2)tAnd the rectangular equation of curve C is:(x - 1)² + (y - 1)² = 2Alternatively, expanded as x² + y² = 2x + 2y.Okay, that takes care of part (1). Now, moving on to part (2). It says that line l intersects curve C at two points A and B, and we need to find |PA|² + |PB|².Hmm, so points A and B are the intersection points between line l and curve C. Since we have the parametric equations for l, we can substitute them into the equation of C to find the parameter values t that correspond to points A and B.So, let's substitute x and y from the parametric equations into the rectangular equation of C.Given:x = 1 - (√2/2)ty = (√2/2)tAnd the equation of C is x² + y² = 2x + 2y.Substituting x and y:[1 - (√2/2)t]² + [(√2/2)t]² = 2[1 - (√2/2)t] + 2[(√2/2)t]Let me expand each term step by step.First, expand [1 - (√2/2)t]²:= 1² - 2*1*(√2/2)t + [(√2/2)t]²= 1 - √2 t + (2/4)t²= 1 - √2 t + (1/2)t²Next, expand [(√2/2)t]²:= (2/4)t²= (1/2)t²So, the left side becomes:[1 - √2 t + (1/2)t²] + [(1/2)t²] = 1 - √2 t + (1/2 + 1/2)t² = 1 - √2 t + t²Now, the right side:2[1 - (√2/2)t] + 2[(√2/2)t]= 2*1 - 2*(√2/2)t + 2*(√2/2)t= 2 - √2 t + √2 t= 2Because the -√2 t and +√2 t cancel each other out.So, putting it all together:Left side: 1 - √2 t + t²Right side: 2So, the equation is:1 - √2 t + t² = 2Subtract 2 from both sides:t² - √2 t - 1 = 0So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of t: t² - √2 t - 1 = 0Let me write that down:t² - √2 t - 1 = 0We can solve this quadratic equation for t. Let's denote the roots as t₁ and t₂.Using the quadratic formula:t = [√2 ± √( (√2)² - 4*1*(-1) )]/(2*1)Simplify inside the square root:(√2)² = 24*1*(-1) = -4So, discriminant is 2 - (-4) = 6Wait, no, discriminant is b² - 4ac. Here, a=1, b=-√2, c=-1.So, discriminant D = (-√2)² - 4*1*(-1) = 2 + 4 = 6So, t = [√2 ± √6]/2Therefore, the two solutions are:t₁ = [√2 + √6]/2t₂ = [√2 - √6]/2So, these are the parameter values corresponding to points A and B on line l.Now, we need to find |PA|² + |PB|². Since P is the point (1, 0), and A and B are points on the line l, which is parameterized by t, we can express points A and B in terms of t₁ and t₂.But in the parametric equations, when t=0, we are at point P (1, 0). So, the parameter t represents the directed distance from P along the line l. Therefore, the distance from P to A is |t₁| and from P to B is |t₂|. However, since t can be positive or negative, the actual distance is |t| times the length of the direction vector.Wait, hold on. In parametric equations, the parameter t doesn't necessarily represent the actual distance unless the direction vector is a unit vector. In our case, the direction vector is (√2/2, -√2/2), which is a unit vector because (√2/2)² + (-√2/2)² = (2/4) + (2/4) = 1. So, yes, in this case, t represents the actual distance from point P along the line l.Therefore, |PA| is |t₁| and |PB| is |t₂|. But since t₁ and t₂ are roots of the quadratic equation, we can find t₁ + t₂ and t₁ t₂ from the equation.Given the quadratic equation t² - √2 t - 1 = 0, the sum of roots t₁ + t₂ = √2, and the product t₁ t₂ = -1.We need to find |PA|² + |PB|². Since |PA| = |t₁| and |PB| = |t₂|, then |PA|² + |PB|² = t₁² + t₂².But t₁² + t₂² can be expressed in terms of (t₁ + t₂)² - 2 t₁ t₂.So, let's compute that:t₁² + t₂² = (t₁ + t₂)² - 2 t₁ t₂We know t₁ + t₂ = √2, so (t₁ + t₂)² = (√2)² = 2And t₁ t₂ = -1, so 2 t₁ t₂ = -2Therefore,t₁² + t₂² = 2 - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4So, |PA|² + |PB|² = 4.Wait, let me double-check that. Since t₁ and t₂ are the parameters, and they can be positive or negative, but when we square them, the signs don't matter. So, regardless of whether t₁ and t₂ are positive or negative, their squares will add up to 4.Alternatively, if I compute t₁² and t₂² individually:t₁ = [√2 + √6]/2t₁² = ( (√2 + √6)² ) / 4 = (2 + 2√12 + 6)/4 = (8 + 4√3)/4 = 2 + √3Similarly, t₂ = [√2 - √6]/2t₂² = ( (√2 - √6)² ) / 4 = (2 - 2√12 + 6)/4 = (8 - 4√3)/4 = 2 - √3So, t₁² + t₂² = (2 + √3) + (2 - √3) = 4Yes, that confirms it. So, |PA|² + |PB|² = 4.Therefore, the value is 4.**Final Answer**The value of (|PA|^2 + |PB|^2) is boxed{4})."},{"question":"A group of people pays a certain amount for admission tickets to an amusement park.

I think I can use logarithm properties to simplify this. Specifically, log₂(a_{n+1}) - log₂(a_n) is equal to log₂(a_{n+1}/a_n). So, that equals 1. So, log₂(a_{n+1}/a_n) = 1. To get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this as a_{n+1}/a_n = 2^1 = 2. Ah, so the ratio of consecutive terms is 2, which is a constant. Therefore, {a_n} is indeed a geometric sequence with first term 2 and common ratio 2. That should take care of part (1). Let me write that down more formally. We have log₂(a_{n+1}) - log₂(a_n) = 1. Using logarithm properties, this is log₂(a_{n+1}/a_n) = 1. Converting from logarithmic to exponential form, we get a_{n+1}/a_n = 2. Since this ratio is constant for all n, {a_n} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2. Cool, that wasn't too bad. Now, part (2) is a bit more involved. It asks me to find the sum of the first n terms S_n of the sequence {a_n b_n}. First, I need to figure out what a_n and b_n are. From part (1), since {a_n} is geometric with a₁ = 2 and common ratio 2, the general term is a_n = 2 * 2^{n-1} = 2^n. That simplifies things. Now, b_n is given by 3 log₂(a_n) - 2. Since a_n = 2^n, log₂(a_n) is log₂(2^n) = n. So, b_n = 3n - 2. Therefore, the sequence {a_n b_n} is a_n multiplied by b_n, which is (2^n)(3n - 2). So, each term is (3n - 2) * 2^n. So, S_n is the sum from k=1 to n of (3k - 2) * 2^k. Hmm, that seems like a sum that involves both an arithmetic component (3k - 2) and a geometric component (2^k). I remember that when you have sums like this, you can sometimes split them into two separate sums or use a technique involving multiplying by the common ratio and subtracting. Let me write out the sum:S_n = Σ_{k=1}^n (3k - 2) * 2^kI can split this into two separate sums:S_n = 3 Σ_{k=1}^n k * 2^k - 2 Σ_{k=1}^n 2^kSo, now I have two sums: one is 3 times the sum of k*2^k from k=1 to n, and the other is -2 times the sum of 2^k from k=1 to n. I know that the sum of 2^k from k=1 to n is a geometric series. The formula for the sum of a geometric series Σ_{k=0}^n ar^k is a(r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). But here, the sum starts at k=1, so it's 2*(2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^{n+1} - 2. Wait, let me check that:Σ_{k=1}^n 2^k = 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^n = 2(2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^{n+1} - 2. Yeah, that's correct.So, the second sum is -2*(2^{n+1} - 2) = -2^{n+2} + 4.Now, the first sum is 3 Σ_{k=1}^n k*2^k. This is trickier. I need a formula for Σ_{k=1}^n k*r^k. I recall that there is a formula for this.Let me recall: For Σ_{k=1}^n k*r^k, the sum is r(1 - (n+1)r^n + n r^{n+1}) / (1 - r)^2.But since r = 2 here, let me plug that in.So, Σ_{k=1}^n k*2^k = 2(1 - (n+1)2^n + n*2^{n+1}) / (1 - 2)^2Simplify denominator: (1 - 2)^2 = 1, so it's just 2(1 - (n+1)2^n + n*2^{n+1})Let me expand the numerator:2*(1 - (n+1)2^n + n*2^{n+1}) = 2 - 2(n+1)2^n + 2n*2^{n+1}Wait, let me compute each term:First term: 2*1 = 2Second term: 2*(-(n+1)2^n) = -2(n+1)2^n = - (n+1)2^{n+1}Third term: 2*(n*2^{n+1}) = n*2^{n+2}Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.Alternatively, I remember that Σ_{k=1}^n k r^{k} = r(1 - (n+1) r^n + n r^{n+1}) ) / (1 - r)^2.So, plugging r = 2:Σ_{k=1}^n k*2^k = 2(1 - (n+1)2^n + n*2^{n+1}) / (1 - 2)^2Denominator: (1 - 2)^2 = 1, so it's just 2(1 - (n+1)2^n + n*2^{n+1})Let me compute numerator:2*(1 - (n+1)2^n + n*2^{n+1}) = 2*1 - 2*(n+1)2^n + 2*n*2^{n+1}Simplify each term:First term: 2Second term: -2*(n+1)2^n = - (n+1)2^{n+1}Third term: 2*n*2^{n+1} = n*2^{n+2}So, altogether:2 - (n+1)2^{n+1} + n*2^{n+2}Hmm, let me factor out 2^{n+1}:= 2 + 2^{n+1} [ - (n+1) + n*2 ]Simplify inside the brackets:- (n + 1) + 2n = (-n -1 + 2n) = (n -1)So, we have:2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}Therefore, Σ_{k=1}^n k*2^k = 2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}Wait, let me verify this with a small n, say n=1.For n=1: Σ_{k=1}^1 k*2^k = 1*2 = 2.Using the formula: 2 + (1 -1)2^{2} = 2 + 0 = 2. Correct.For n=2: Σ_{k=1}^2 k*2^k = 2 + 8 = 10.Using the formula: 2 + (2 -1)2^{3} = 2 + 8 = 10. Correct.For n=3: Σ_{k=1}^3 k*2^k = 2 + 8 + 24 = 34.Formula: 2 + (3 -1)2^{4} = 2 + 2*16 = 2 +32=34. Correct.Okay, so the formula seems to hold. So, Σ_{k=1}^n k*2^k = 2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}Therefore, going back to our original sum:S_n = 3 Σ_{k=1}^n k*2^k - 2 Σ_{k=1}^n 2^k= 3[2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}] - 2[2^{n+1} - 2]Let me compute each part:First part: 3[2 + (n -1)2^{n+1}] = 6 + 3(n -1)2^{n+1}Second part: -2[2^{n+1} - 2] = -2*2^{n+1} + 4So, combining them:S_n = 6 + 3(n -1)2^{n+1} - 2*2^{n+1} + 4Combine constants: 6 + 4 = 10Combine the terms with 2^{n+1}:3(n -1)2^{n+1} - 2*2^{n+1} = [3(n -1) - 2]2^{n+1}Simplify inside the brackets:3n -3 -2 = 3n -5So, S_n = 10 + (3n -5)2^{n+1}Hmm, that seems to be the result. Let me test it with n=1, 2, 3 to make sure.For n=1:S₁ = a₁b₁ = 2*(3*1 -2) = 2*(1) = 2Using the formula: 10 + (3*1 -5)2^{2} = 10 + (-2)*4 = 10 -8 = 2. Correct.For n=2:S₂ = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ = 2*1 + 4*4 = 2 + 16 = 18Formula: 10 + (6 -5)2^{3} = 10 +1*8 = 18. Correct.For n=3:S₃ = 2 + 16 + 48 = 66Formula: 10 + (9 -5)2^{4} = 10 +4*16=10 +64=74. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, did I make a mistake?Wait, let's compute S₃ manually:a₁=2, b₁=1, so a₁b₁=2a₂=4, b₂=4, so a₂b₂=16a₃=8, b₃=7, so a₃b₃=56Thus, S₃=2 +16 +56=74Using the formula: 10 + (9 -5)16=10 +4*16=10 +64=74. Correct.Wait, earlier when I thought it didn't match, I must have miscalculated. So, it's correct.Wait, but when I thought of n=3, I had a₃b₃=8*7=56, so S₃=2+16+56=74, which matches the formula. So, all is good.Therefore, the sum S_n is 10 + (3n -5)2^{n+1}So, to write it neatly, S_n = 10 + (3n -5)2^{n+1}I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The sum of the first ( n ) terms of the sequence ({a_n b_n}) is (boxed{10 + (3n - 5) times 2^{n+1}})."},{"question":"Let ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) be real numbers such that ( 9x^2 + 4y^2 + 25z^2 = 1 ). Find the maximum value of [ 8x + 5y + 15z. ]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the maximum value of the expression (8x + 5y + 15z) given that (9x^2 + 4y^2 + 25z^2 = 1). Hmm, that looks like a quadratic constraint with a linear expression to maximize. I remember something about using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for these types of problems. Let me try to recall how that works.First, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real vectors ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ), the following holds:[(mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b})^2 leq (mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{a})(mathbf{b} cdot mathbf{b})]Which can be written as:[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + dots + a_nb_n)^2 leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + dots + b_n^2)]So, in this case, I can think of (8x + 5y + 15z) as the dot product of two vectors. Let me define them properly.Let me set vector ( mathbf{a} = (8, 5, 15) ) and vector ( mathbf{b} = (x, y, z) ). Then, the expression (8x + 5y + 15z) is just ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} ).Now, applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:[(mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b})^2 leq (mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{a})(mathbf{b} cdot mathbf{b})]Which translates to:[(8x + 5y + 15z)^2 leq (8^2 + 5^2 + 15^2)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)]Wait, but hold on, the constraint given isn't (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1), it's (9x^2 + 4y^2 + 25z^2 = 1). So, I need to adjust for that.Maybe I can rewrite the constraint in a way that matches the form required for Cauchy-Schwarz. Let me think. If I have (9x^2 + 4y^2 + 25z^2 = 1), that can be written as:[(3x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (5z)^2 = 1]So, if I let (a = 3x), (b = 2y), and (c = 5z), then the constraint becomes (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1). That might make things easier.Now, I need to express the original expression (8x + 5y + 15z) in terms of (a), (b), and (c). Let's see:Since (a = 3x), then (x = frac{a}{3}).Similarly, (b = 2y) implies (y = frac{b}{2}), and (c = 5z) implies (z = frac{c}{5}).Substituting these into (8x + 5y + 15z):[8left(frac{a}{3}right) + 5left(frac{b}{2}right) + 15left(frac{c}{5}right)]Simplify each term:[frac{8a}{3} + frac{5b}{2} + 3c]So, the expression becomes (frac{8}{3}a + frac{5}{2}b + 3c).Now, I can think of this as the dot product of two vectors in the (a), (b), (c) space. Let me define vector ( mathbf{u} = left(frac{8}{3}, frac{5}{2}, 3right) ) and vector ( mathbf{v} = (a, b, c) ). Then, the expression is ( mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{v} ).Applying Cauchy-Schwarz now:[(mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{v})^2 leq (mathbf{u} cdot mathbf{u})(mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{v})]Given that (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1), which is ( mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{v} = 1 ), so:[left(frac{8}{3}a + frac{5}{2}b + 3cright)^2 leq left(left(frac{8}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{5}{2}right)^2 + 3^2right) times 1]Let me compute the right-hand side:[left(frac{64}{9} + frac{25}{4} + 9right)]Calculating each term:- ( frac{64}{9} approx 7.1111 )- ( frac{25}{4} = 6.25 )- ( 9 ) is just 9.Adding them up:[7.1111 + 6.25 + 9 = 22.3611]So, the inequality becomes:[left(frac{8}{3}a + frac{5}{2}b + 3cright)^2 leq 22.3611]Taking square roots on both sides:[frac{8}{3}a + frac{5}{2}b + 3c leq sqrt{22.3611} approx 4.73]Wait, but this is in terms of (a), (b), and (c). Remember, (a = 3x), (b = 2y), (c = 5z). So, substituting back, we have:[frac{8}{3}(3x) + frac{5}{2}(2y) + 3(5z) = 8x + 5y + 15z]Which is exactly the expression we wanted to maximize. So, the maximum value of (8x + 5y + 15z) is approximately 4.73. But let me write it more precisely.Since (22.3611) is approximately (frac{201}{9}), but actually, let me compute it exactly. Let's compute (frac{64}{9} + frac{25}{4} + 9) as fractions.First, find a common denominator. The denominators are 9, 4, and 1. The least common denominator is 36.Convert each term:- ( frac{64}{9} = frac{64 times 4}{36} = frac{256}{36} )- ( frac{25}{4} = frac{25 times 9}{36} = frac{225}{36} )- ( 9 = frac{9 times 36}{36} = frac{324}{36} )Adding them together:[frac{256 + 225 + 324}{36} = frac{805}{36}]So, the right-hand side is (frac{805}{36}). Therefore, the inequality is:[(8x + 5y + 15z)^2 leq frac{805}{36}]Taking square roots:[8x + 5y + 15z leq sqrt{frac{805}{36}} = frac{sqrt{805}}{6}]Calculating (sqrt{805}):- (28^2 = 784)- (29^2 = 841)So, (sqrt{805}) is between 28 and 29. Let me compute it more accurately.Compute (28.5^2 = 812.25), which is higher than 805. So, it's between 28 and 28.5.Compute (28.4^2 = 806.56), still higher.Compute (28.3^2 = 800.89), which is lower than 805.So, between 28.3 and 28.4.Compute (28.35^2 = (28 + 0.35)^2 = 28^2 + 2 times 28 times 0.35 + 0.35^2 = 784 + 19.6 + 0.1225 = 803.7225)Still lower than 805.Compute (28.36^2 = (28.35 + 0.01)^2 = 28.35^2 + 2 times 28.35 times 0.01 + 0.01^2 = 803.7225 + 0.567 + 0.0001 = 804.2896)Still lower.Compute (28.37^2 = 28.36^2 + 2 times 28.36 times 0.01 + 0.01^2 = 804.2896 + 0.5672 + 0.0001 = 804.8569)Still lower than 805.Compute (28.38^2 = 28.37^2 + 2 times 28.37 times 0.01 + 0.01^2 = 804.8569 + 0.5674 + 0.0001 = 805.4244)Now, that's higher than 805. So, (sqrt{805}) is between 28.37 and 28.38.To approximate, let's see how much more 805 is than 804.8569.805 - 804.8569 = 0.1431The difference between 28.37^2 and 28.38^2 is 805.4244 - 804.8569 = 0.5675So, 0.1431 / 0.5675 ≈ 0.252So, approximately, (sqrt{805} ≈ 28.37 + 0.252 times 0.01 ≈ 28.37 + 0.00252 ≈ 28.3725)Therefore, (sqrt{805} ≈ 28.3725)Thus, (frac{sqrt{805}}{6} ≈ frac{28.3725}{6} ≈ 4.72875), which is approximately 4.73.So, the maximum value is approximately 4.73.But let me check if equality holds in Cauchy-Schwarz. For equality, the vectors must be proportional. That is, there exists a constant (k) such that:[frac{8}{3} = k times 3x, quad frac{5}{2} = k times 2y, quad 3 = k times 5z]Wait, actually, in the transformed variables (a), (b), (c), the vectors ( mathbf{u} ) and ( mathbf{v} ) must be proportional. So, ( frac{8}{3} = k a ), ( frac{5}{2} = k b ), ( 3 = k c ).But (a = 3x), (b = 2y), (c = 5z). So, substituting back:From ( frac{8}{3} = k a = k times 3x ), so ( frac{8}{3} = 3k x ) => ( x = frac{8}{9k} )Similarly, ( frac{5}{2} = k b = k times 2y ) => ( y = frac{5}{4k} )And ( 3 = k c = k times 5z ) => ( z = frac{3}{5k} )Now, substitute these into the constraint (9x^2 + 4y^2 + 25z^2 = 1):Compute each term:- (9x^2 = 9 times left(frac{8}{9k}right)^2 = 9 times frac{64}{81k^2} = frac{64}{9k^2})- (4y^2 = 4 times left(frac{5}{4k}right)^2 = 4 times frac{25}{16k^2} = frac{25}{4k^2})- (25z^2 = 25 times left(frac{3}{5k}right)^2 = 25 times frac{9}{25k^2} = frac{9}{k^2})Adding them together:[frac{64}{9k^2} + frac{25}{4k^2} + frac{9}{k^2} = 1]Factor out (frac{1}{k^2}):[left(frac{64}{9} + frac{25}{4} + 9right) times frac{1}{k^2} = 1]But we already computed (frac{64}{9} + frac{25}{4} + 9 = frac{805}{36}). So:[frac{805}{36} times frac{1}{k^2} = 1 implies frac{805}{36} = k^2 implies k = sqrt{frac{805}{36}} = frac{sqrt{805}}{6}]So, (k = frac{sqrt{805}}{6}), which is the same as the maximum value we found earlier.Therefore, the maximum value is indeed (frac{sqrt{805}}{6}), which is approximately 4.73.But let me just verify by plugging back the values of (x), (y), and (z) into the original expression.From earlier, (x = frac{8}{9k}), (y = frac{5}{4k}), (z = frac{3}{5k}), and (k = frac{sqrt{805}}{6}).Compute (8x + 5y + 15z):[8 times frac{8}{9k} + 5 times frac{5}{4k} + 15 times frac{3}{5k}]Simplify each term:- (8 times frac{8}{9k} = frac{64}{9k})- (5 times frac{5}{4k} = frac{25}{4k})- (15 times frac{3}{5k} = frac{45}{5k} = frac{9}{k})Adding them together:[frac{64}{9k} + frac{25}{4k} + frac{9}{k}]Factor out (frac{1}{k}):[left(frac{64}{9} + frac{25}{4} + 9right) times frac{1}{k}]Again, we know that (frac{64}{9} + frac{25}{4} + 9 = frac{805}{36}), so:[frac{805}{36} times frac{1}{k} = frac{805}{36} times frac{6}{sqrt{805}} = frac{805 times 6}{36 sqrt{805}} = frac{6}{36} times sqrt{805} = frac{1}{6} times sqrt{805}]Which is exactly (k), confirming that (8x + 5y + 15z = k = frac{sqrt{805}}{6}).Therefore, the maximum value is (frac{sqrt{805}}{6}), which is approximately 4.73. So, the exact value is (frac{sqrt{805}}{6}), and that's the maximum.I think that's solid. I applied Cauchy-Schwarz correctly, transformed the variables to match the constraint, found the maximum value, checked the conditions for equality, and verified by plugging back the values.

Let me group the terms with similar square roots:- The term with ( sqrt{x_1} ): only ( sqrt{x_1} ).- The term with ( sqrt{x_2} ): ( -sqrt{x_2} + sqrt{2}sqrt{x_2} = (sqrt{2} - 1)sqrt{x_2} ).- The term with ( sqrt{x_3} ): ( -sqrt{2}sqrt{x_3} + sqrt{3}sqrt{x_3} = (sqrt{3} - sqrt{2})sqrt{x_3} ).- Similarly, for ( sqrt{x_4} ): ( (sqrt{4} - sqrt{3})sqrt{x_4} ).- ...- The term with ( sqrt{x_n} ): ( (sqrt{n} - sqrt{n-1})sqrt{x_n} ).- The term with ( sqrt{x_{n+1}} ): ( -sqrt{n}sqrt{x_{n+1}} ).But since ( x_{n+1} = 0 ), the last term is zero. So, putting it all together, the RHS simplifies to:[sqrt{x_1} + (sqrt{2} - 1)sqrt{x_2} + (sqrt{3} - sqrt{2})sqrt{x_3} + ldots + (sqrt{n} - sqrt{n-1})sqrt{x_n}.]Okay, so the RHS is a weighted sum of the square roots of each ( x_i ), where the weights are the differences between consecutive square roots. That is, each weight ( sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1} ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( n ), with ( sqrt{0} = 0 ).Now, the LHS is ( sqrt{sum_{i=1}^n x_i} ). So, I need to compare the square root of the sum with this weighted sum of square roots.I recall that there's an inequality called the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which might be useful here. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers ( a_i ) and ( b_i ), we have:[left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i right)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 right).]But I'm not sure yet how to apply it directly here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of convexity or concavity of the square root function.The square root function is concave, which means that for any non-negative real numbers ( a ) and ( b ) and ( lambda in [0,1] ), we have:[sqrt{lambda a + (1 - lambda) b} geq lambda sqrt{a} + (1 - lambda) sqrt{b}.]But in this case, we have a sum of square roots multiplied by coefficients, so maybe I can use Jensen's inequality. Jensen's inequality for concave functions states that:[sqrt{sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i x_i} geq sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i sqrt{x_i},]where ( lambda_i ) are positive weights summing to 1.Wait, but in our case, the RHS is a sum of square roots multiplied by coefficients, not weights. So, perhaps I need to normalize the coefficients to make them sum to 1.Looking back at the RHS, the coefficients are ( sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1} ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( n ). Let me compute the sum of these coefficients:Sum = ( (sqrt{1} - sqrt{0}) + (sqrt{2} - sqrt{1}) + (sqrt{3} - sqrt{2}) + ldots + (sqrt{n} - sqrt{n-1}) ).This is a telescoping series! All the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:Sum = ( sqrt{n} - sqrt{0} = sqrt{n} ).So, the sum of the coefficients is ( sqrt{n} ). Therefore, if I divide each coefficient by ( sqrt{n} ), the weights will sum to 1, and I can apply Jensen's inequality.Let me define ( lambda_k = frac{sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1}}{sqrt{n}} ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( n ). Then, we have:[sum_{k=1}^n lambda_k = frac{sqrt{n}}{sqrt{n}} = 1.]Now, applying Jensen's inequality for the concave function ( f(x) = sqrt{x} ):[sqrt{sum_{k=1}^n lambda_k x_k} geq sum_{k=1}^n lambda_k sqrt{x_k}.]But wait, this is the opposite direction of what we need. The LHS is ( sqrt{sum lambda_k x_k} ), which is less than or equal to ( sum lambda_k sqrt{x_k} ) because of concavity. However, in our problem, the LHS is ( sqrt{sum x_k} ), which is different from ( sqrt{sum lambda_k x_k} ).Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the relationship between the LHS and the RHS.Another idea: perhaps I can square both sides of the inequality to eliminate the square roots. That might make it easier to handle.So, let's square both sides:LHS squared: ( x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n ).RHS squared: ( left( (sqrt{x_1} - sqrt{x_2}) + sqrt{2}(sqrt{x_2} - sqrt{x_3}) + ldots + sqrt{n}(sqrt{x_n} - sqrt{x_{n+1}}) right)^2 ).Expanding the RHS squared will involve cross terms, which might be complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern or simplification.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a clever way. Let me consider the vectors involved.Suppose I let ( a_i = sqrt{i} ) for ( i = 1 ) to ( n ), and ( b_i = sqrt{x_i} - sqrt{x_{i+1}} ) for ( i = 1 ) to ( n ), with ( x_{n+1} = 0 ).Then, the RHS is ( sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i ).By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:[left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i right)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 right).]But I need the RHS squared to be greater than or equal to the LHS squared, so maybe this isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the LHS and RHS through another inequality.Wait, let's think about the sum ( sum_{i=1}^n x_i ). Since ( x_i ) is non-increasing, maybe I can bound each ( x_i ) in terms of the differences ( sqrt{x_i} - sqrt{x_{i+1}} ).I recall that for non-negative numbers, ( x_i - x_{i+1} leq sqrt{x_i} + sqrt{x_{i+1}} ), but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( x_i ) in terms of the differences of square roots. Let me define ( y_i = sqrt{x_i} - sqrt{x_{i+1}} ) for ( i = 1 ) to ( n ). Then, ( y_i geq 0 ) because ( x_i geq x_{i+1} ).So, ( sqrt{x_i} = y_i + y_{i+1} + ldots + y_n ). Therefore, ( x_i = (sqrt{x_i})^2 = (y_i + y_{i+1} + ldots + y_n)^2 ).Expanding this, we get:[x_i = y_i^2 + 2 y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 + 2 y_i y_{i+2} + ldots + 2 y_{i+1} y_{i+2} + ldots + y_n^2.]But this seems messy. Maybe instead of expanding, I can sum all ( x_i ) from ( i = 1 ) to ( n ):[sum_{i=1}^n x_i = sum_{i=1}^n (y_i + y_{i+1} + ldots + y_n)^2.]This is a sum of squares, which might be related to the RHS.Wait, the RHS is ( sum_{i=1}^n sqrt{i} y_i ). So, perhaps if I can relate the sum of squares to the square of the sum with coefficients.Let me consider the square of the RHS:[left( sum_{i=1}^n sqrt{i} y_i right)^2 = sum_{i=1}^n i y_i^2 + 2 sum_{1 leq j < k leq n} sqrt{j k} y_j y_k.]Now, comparing this to the LHS squared, which is ( sum_{i=1}^n x_i = sum_{i=1}^n (y_i + y_{i+1} + ldots + y_n)^2 ).Expanding each ( (y_i + y_{i+1} + ldots + y_n)^2 ), we get:[sum_{i=1}^n left( y_i^2 + 2 y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 + 2 y_i y_{i+2} + ldots + 2 y_{i+1} y_{i+2} + ldots + y_n^2 right).]This is quite complicated, but perhaps I can find a relationship between the two expressions.Notice that the LHS squared involves all possible products ( y_j y_k ) for ( j leq k ), while the RHS squared involves ( sqrt{j k} y_j y_k ) for ( j < k ).If I can show that ( sqrt{j k} geq 1 ) for ( j < k ), then the cross terms in the RHS squared would be larger than those in the LHS squared. But ( sqrt{j k} geq 1 ) is not necessarily true for all ( j < k ). For example, if ( j = 1 ) and ( k = 2 ), ( sqrt{1 cdot 2} = sqrt{2} geq 1 ), which is true. Similarly, for ( j = 2 ) and ( k = 3 ), ( sqrt{6} geq 1 ), and so on. Actually, ( sqrt{j k} geq sqrt{1 cdot 2} = sqrt{2} geq 1 ) for ( j < k ), so this might hold.Wait, but even if ( sqrt{j k} geq 1 ), the cross terms in the RHS squared are multiplied by ( 2 sqrt{j k} ), which is larger than the corresponding ( 2 ) in the LHS squared. Therefore, the RHS squared would be larger than the LHS squared, implying that the RHS is larger than the LHS, which is exactly what we need to prove.But let me verify this more carefully. Let's denote:LHS squared = ( sum_{i=1}^n x_i = sum_{i=1}^n (y_i + y_{i+1} + ldots + y_n)^2 ).Expanding this, we get:[sum_{i=1}^n left( y_i^2 + 2 y_i y_{i+1} + y_{i+1}^2 + 2 y_i y_{i+2} + ldots + 2 y_{i+1} y_{i+2} + ldots + y_n^2 right).]This can be rewritten as:[sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 + 2 sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=i+1}^n y_i y_j.]Similarly, the RHS squared is:[sum_{i=1}^n i y_i^2 + 2 sum_{1 leq j < k leq n} sqrt{j k} y_j y_k.]Now, comparing term by term:1. For the ( y_i^2 ) terms: In the LHS squared, the coefficient is 1 for each ( y_i^2 ). In the RHS squared, the coefficient is ( i ) for each ( y_i^2 ). Since ( i geq 1 ), the RHS squared has larger coefficients for the ( y_i^2 ) terms.2. For the cross terms ( y_j y_k ) where ( j < k ): In the LHS squared, the coefficient is 2. In the RHS squared, the coefficient is ( 2 sqrt{j k} ). Since ( sqrt{j k} geq sqrt{1 cdot 2} = sqrt{2} geq 1 ), the RHS squared has larger coefficients for the cross terms.Therefore, the RHS squared is greater than or equal to the LHS squared, which implies that the RHS is greater than or equal to the LHS. Hence, the inequality holds.Wait, but I need to make sure that all the terms are non-negative, which they are because ( x_i ) is non-increasing and ( y_i = sqrt{x_i} - sqrt{x_{i+1}} geq 0 ). So, all the terms involved are non-negative, and thus the inequality is valid.Therefore, I've managed to show that the square of the RHS is greater than or equal to the square of the LHS, which means the original inequality holds. So, the proof is complete."},{"question":"Jason found 49 seashells and 48 starfish on the beach. He gave 13 of the seashells to Tim, and 7 of the seashells to Lily.

Here is the diagram representation:\`\`\`A      C----E  /  /   B     D\`\`\`","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the measure of angle ACD in triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize the diagram they provided. It looks like point A is connected to point C, which is then connected to point E. Point C is also connected to points B and D, forming triangle ABC and another triangle or maybe just lines connecting to D and E.They gave me some angles: angle BAC is 50 degrees, angle BCE is 70 degrees, and angle ECD is 40 degrees. I need to find angle ACD. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, if I know two angles, I can find the third one. They gave me angle BAC, which is at point A, so that's 50 degrees. But I don't know angle ABC or angle ACB yet.Wait, they also mentioned angle BCE is 70 degrees. Point C is connected to E, so angle BCE is at point C between points B and E. That might be part of triangle BCE or maybe just a straight line. Hmm, the problem says DE is a straight line intersecting at point C. So, DE is a straight line passing through point C, which is also a vertex of triangle ABC.So, DE is a straight line, meaning that angles on either side of point C along DE should add up to 180 degrees because they form a linear pair. They told me angle ECD is 40 degrees, so the angle on the other side of DE at point C should be 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. Let me note that down: angle DCE is 140 degrees.Now, angle BCE is 70 degrees. That's the angle at point C between points B and E. Since DE is a straight line, and angle DCE is 140 degrees, which is the angle between points D and E at point C, I think angle BCE and angle ECD are adjacent angles forming angle DCE. So, angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle ECD (40 degrees) equals angle DCE (110 degrees). Wait, that doesn't add up because 70 + 40 is 110, but earlier I thought angle DCE was 140 degrees. Hmm, that's a contradiction.Wait, maybe I misunderstood the diagram. Let me try to sketch it mentally again. Point C is connected to A, B, D, and E. DE is a straight line passing through C, so points D, C, and E are colinear. So, DE is a straight line, and C is somewhere along it. So, angle ECD is 40 degrees, meaning at point C, between points E and D, the angle is 40 degrees. Therefore, the angle on the other side of DE at point C would be 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.But angle BCE is 70 degrees, which is at point C between points B and E. So, if I consider point C, it has angles going to A, B, D, and E. Wait, maybe angle BCE is part of triangle BCE, and angle ECD is part of triangle ECD. But since DE is a straight line, perhaps angle BCE and angle ECD are supplementary? That is, they add up to 180 degrees. But 70 + 40 is 110, which is less than 180, so that can't be.Wait, maybe angle BCE and angle ECD are on different sides of DE. So, angle BCE is on one side, and angle ECD is on the other side, making them supplementary. So, angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle ECD (40 degrees) equals 110 degrees, but that's still less than 180. Hmm, I'm getting confused.Let me try a different approach. Let's focus on triangle ABC first. I know angle BAC is 50 degrees. If I can find another angle in triangle ABC, I can find the third one. But I don't have enough information yet. Maybe I need to use the information about angles at point C involving DE.Since DE is a straight line through C, and angle ECD is 40 degrees, that means the angle between EC and DC is 40 degrees. So, angle ECD = 40 degrees. Also, angle BCE is 70 degrees, which is the angle between BC and EC. So, at point C, we have two angles: one between BC and EC (70 degrees) and another between EC and DC (40 degrees). Therefore, the total angle at point C along DE is 70 + 40 = 110 degrees. But since DE is a straight line, the angle on the other side of DE at point C should be 180 - 110 = 70 degrees. Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought angle DCE was 140 degrees.I think I'm mixing up the angles. Let me clarify: at point C, we have angles going to A, B, D, and E. The straight line DE means that the angles on either side of DE at point C add up to 180 degrees. So, angle ECD (40 degrees) is on one side, and the angle on the other side (let's call it angle DCE) is 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. But angle BCE is 70 degrees, which is part of that 140 degrees. So, angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle ECD (40 degrees) equals angle DCE (110 degrees), but that contradicts the earlier calculation of 140 degrees. Hmm, I must be missing something.Wait, maybe angle BCE is not part of angle DCE. Let me think. If DE is a straight line through C, then angle BCE is on one side of DE, and angle ECD is on the other side. So, angle BCE (70 degrees) and angle ECD (40 degrees) are on opposite sides of DE, making them supplementary. Therefore, 70 + 40 = 110 degrees, which is less than 180, so that can't be. Wait, no, if they are on opposite sides, they should add up to 180 degrees. But 70 + 40 = 110, which is not 180. So, that doesn't make sense either.I think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider the angles at point C. In triangle ABC, angle ACB is one of the angles we need to find. If I can find angle ACB, then maybe I can relate it to angle ACD.Given that angle BAC is 50 degrees, if I can find another angle in triangle ABC, I can find angle ACB. But I don't have angle ABC. However, maybe I can use the information about angles at point C involving DE.Since DE is a straight line through C, and angle ECD is 40 degrees, that means the angle between EC and DC is 40 degrees. Also, angle BCE is 70 degrees, which is the angle between BC and EC. So, at point C, the angles are: angle BCA (which is part of triangle ABC), angle BCE (70 degrees), and angle ECD (40 degrees). Wait, but these angles are all around point C, so they should add up to 360 degrees.So, angle BCA (which is angle ACB in triangle ABC) plus angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle ECD (40 degrees) plus the angle on the other side of DE (which we don't know yet) equals 360 degrees. But since DE is a straight line, the angles on either side of DE at point C should add up to 180 degrees. So, angle ECD (40 degrees) plus the angle on the other side (let's call it angle DCE) equals 180 degrees. Therefore, angle DCE = 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.Now, angle BCA (angle ACB) plus angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle DCE (140 degrees) equals 360 degrees? Wait, no, because angle BCA is part of triangle ABC, and angle BCE and angle DCE are around point C. I'm getting confused again.Let me try to list all the angles around point C:1. Angle ACB (part of triangle ABC)2. Angle BCE (70 degrees)3. Angle ECD (40 degrees)4. The angle on the other side of DE, which we calculated as 140 degrees.But these four angles should add up to 360 degrees because they are all around point C. So:Angle ACB + 70 + 40 + 140 = 360Angle ACB + 250 = 360Angle ACB = 360 - 250 = 110 degrees.Wait, that can't be right because in triangle ABC, the sum of angles should be 180 degrees. If angle BAC is 50 degrees and angle ACB is 110 degrees, then angle ABC would be 180 - 50 - 110 = 20 degrees. That seems possible, but let me check if this makes sense with the other information.If angle ACB is 110 degrees, and angle BCE is 70 degrees, then angle ECD is 40 degrees. So, at point C, angle ACB is 110 degrees, which is the angle between AC and BC. Then, from BC, we have angle BCE (70 degrees) leading to E, and from E, angle ECD (40 degrees) leading to D. So, the total angle from BC to DC around point C is 70 + 40 = 110 degrees, which matches angle ACB. That makes sense because angle ACB is the angle between AC and BC, and the angles from BC to DC (110 degrees) should be equal to angle ACB if AC and DC are aligned in a certain way.Wait, but angle ACB is 110 degrees, and the angles from BC to DC are also 110 degrees, so that means AC and DC are in the same line? That would make sense because if angle ACB is 110 degrees, and the angles from BC to DC are also 110 degrees, then AC and DC are colinear. But in the diagram, AC is connected to C, and DC is connected to C as well, but they are not necessarily colinear unless specified.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that angle ACB is 110 degrees. Let me go back.We have:Angle ACB + angle BCE + angle ECD + angle DCE = 360 degreesBut angle DCE is 140 degrees, as calculated earlier.So:Angle ACB + 70 + 40 + 140 = 360Angle ACB + 250 = 360Angle ACB = 110 degrees.But in triangle ABC, angle ACB is 110 degrees, angle BAC is 50 degrees, so angle ABC is 20 degrees.Now, considering triangle BCE, we have angle BCE = 70 degrees, angle at C is 70 degrees, and angle at E is something. But I don't have enough information about triangle BCE.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that DE is a straight line and angle ECD is 40 degrees. So, angle between EC and DC is 40 degrees. If angle ACB is 110 degrees, and angle BCE is 70 degrees, then angle ACB is the angle between AC and BC, which is 110 degrees. Then, from BC, we have angle BCE (70 degrees) leading to E, and from E, angle ECD (40 degrees) leading to D.So, the total angle from BC to DC is 70 + 40 = 110 degrees, which matches angle ACB. Therefore, AC and DC are colinear, meaning that point D lies on the extension of AC beyond C. But in the diagram, AC is connected to C, and DC is connected to C as well, but they are not necessarily colinear unless specified.Wait, but if AC and DC are colinear, then angle ACD would be 180 degrees, which contradicts the given information. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider triangle BCE and triangle ECD separately.In triangle BCE, we know angle BCE is 70 degrees. If I can find another angle in this triangle, I can find the third one. But I don't have enough information.In triangle ECD, we know angle ECD is 40 degrees. Again, without more information, it's hard to proceed.Wait, but since DE is a straight line, maybe we can use the concept of exterior angles or something related to parallel lines, but I don't see any indication of parallel lines here.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles around point C is 360 degrees. So, angle ACB (which is part of triangle ABC) plus angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle ECD (40 degrees) plus the angle on the other side of DE (which we calculated as 140 degrees) equals 360 degrees. So:Angle ACB + 70 + 40 + 140 = 360Angle ACB + 250 = 360Angle ACB = 110 degrees.But as before, this leads to angle ABC being 20 degrees in triangle ABC.Now, if angle ACB is 110 degrees, and angle ECD is 40 degrees, then angle ACD would be angle ACB minus angle ECD? Wait, no, because angle ACB is the angle between AC and BC, and angle ECD is the angle between EC and DC. They are not directly related unless AC and DC are aligned in a certain way.Wait, maybe angle ACD is the angle between AC and DC. So, if AC and DC are not colinear, then angle ACD is the angle between them. To find this angle, we might need to consider the angles around point C.We have angle ACB = 110 degrees, which is the angle between AC and BC. Then, from BC, we have angle BCE = 70 degrees leading to E, and from E, angle ECD = 40 degrees leading to D. So, the total angle from AC to DC would be angle ACB (110 degrees) minus angle BCE (70 degrees) plus angle ECD (40 degrees)? Wait, that doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe angle ACD is equal to angle ACB minus angle BCE. So, 110 - 70 = 40 degrees. But angle ECD is already 40 degrees, so that would mean angle ACD is 40 degrees, but that seems too straightforward.Wait, no, because angle ACB is the angle between AC and BC, and angle BCE is the angle between BC and EC. So, angle ACB is 110 degrees, and angle BCE is 70 degrees, so the angle between AC and EC would be angle ACB - angle BCE = 110 - 70 = 40 degrees. But angle ECD is 40 degrees, which is the angle between EC and DC. So, if the angle between AC and EC is 40 degrees, and the angle between EC and DC is also 40 degrees, then the total angle from AC to DC is 40 + 40 = 80 degrees. Therefore, angle ACD is 80 degrees.Wait, that makes sense. So, angle ACD is the angle between AC and DC, which is the sum of the angles from AC to EC (40 degrees) and from EC to DC (40 degrees), totaling 80 degrees.Let me verify this:- In triangle ABC, angle BAC = 50 degrees, angle ACB = 110 degrees (calculated earlier), so angle ABC = 20 degrees.- At point C, angles around it sum to 360 degrees: angle ACB (110) + angle BCE (70) + angle ECD (40) + angle DCE (140) = 360 degrees. Wait, but 110 + 70 + 40 + 140 = 360, which checks out.- Now, angle ACD is the angle between AC and DC. Since AC to EC is 40 degrees (angle ACB - angle BCE = 110 - 70 = 40), and EC to DC is 40 degrees (angle ECD), then AC to DC is 40 + 40 = 80 degrees.Yes, that seems correct. So, angle ACD is 80 degrees."},{"question":"Calculate the result of sqrt{2} times sqrt{3} div frac{1}{sqrt{6}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here: √2 multiplied by √3, and then divided by 1 over √6. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I remember that when you multiply square roots, you can combine them under a single square root. So, √2 times √3 should be √(2*3), which is √6. That part seems straightforward.Now, the next part is dividing by 1 over √6. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, right? So, instead of dividing by 1/√6, I can multiply by √6/1. That means √6 divided by 1/√6 is the same as √6 multiplied by √6. Wait, √6 times √6 is just 6 because the square root of a number times itself equals the number. So, putting it all together, √2 times √3 is √6, and then √6 divided by 1/√6 is √6 times √6, which is 6. That seems to make sense. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting over: √2 * √3 = √(2*3) = √6. Then, √6 divided by (1/√6) is √6 * √6 = 6. Yep, that checks out.

Hmm, rectangular form is like a + bi, right? So I need to find the real part and the imaginary part of this complex number.First, I remember that Euler's formula can help me here. Euler's formula says that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. So, if I have something like re^(iθ), it should be r(cosθ + i sinθ). That makes sense because r is the magnitude, and θ is the angle in the complex plane.In this case, r is √3, and θ is 13π/6. So, applying Euler's formula, I can write √3 e^(13πi/6) as √3 (cos(13π/6) + i sin(13π/6)). Alright, so I need to compute cos(13π/6) and sin(13π/6).Wait, 13π/6 seems like a large angle. I think angles in the unit circle are usually considered between 0 and 2π, so maybe I should subtract 2π to find an equivalent angle. Let me calculate 13π/6 minus 2π. Since 2π is 12π/6, subtracting that from 13π/6 gives me π/6. So, 13π/6 is the same as π/6 when considering the unit circle because it's just one full rotation (2π) plus π/6.That means cos(13π/6) is the same as cos(π/6), and sin(13π/6) is the same as sin(π/6). I remember the exact values for these. Cos(π/6) is √3/2, and sin(π/6) is 1/2. So, plugging these back into the equation, I get:√3 (cos(π/6) + i sin(π/6)) = √3 (√3/2 + i * 1/2)Now, I need to multiply √3 by each term inside the parentheses. Let's do that step by step.First, √3 * √3/2. Multiplying √3 by √3 gives me 3, so that term becomes 3/2.Next, √3 * 1/2. That's just √3/2.Putting it all together, I have:√3 (√3/2 + i * 1/2) = 3/2 + i * √3/2So, the rectangular form of √3 e^(13πi/6) is 3/2 + (√3/2)i.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I converted the angle by subtracting 2π, which gave me π/6. Then I used the known cosine and sine values for π/6. Multiplying √3 by √3/2 gives 3/2, and √3 by 1/2 gives √3/2. Yeah, that seems right.I think I did everything correctly. So, the final answer should be 3/2 + (√3/2)i."},{"question":"Let  r  be a real number such that  sqrt[3]{r} - frac{1}{sqrt[3]{r}}=2 . Find  r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ( r ) be a real number such that ( sqrt[3]{r} - frac{1}{sqrt[3]{r}} = 2 ). I need to find ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.First, let me try to simplify the given equation. The equation involves cube roots, which can sometimes be a bit confusing. Maybe I can make a substitution to make it easier to handle. Let me let ( x = sqrt[3]{r} ). That means ( x ) is the cube root of ( r ), so ( x^3 = r ). Similarly, ( frac{1}{sqrt[3]{r}} ) would be ( frac{1}{x} ), since ( sqrt[3]{r} = x ). So, substituting these into the equation, I get:( x - frac{1}{x} = 2 )Alright, that looks simpler. Now, I need to find ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ). Since ( r = x^3 ), then ( r^3 = (x^3)^3 = x^9 ). Wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Actually, ( r = x^3 ), so ( r^3 = (x^3)^3 = x^9 ). Similarly, ( frac{1}{r^3} = frac{1}{(x^3)^3} = frac{1}{x^9} ). Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.Wait, perhaps I don't need to go all the way to the ninth power. Let me think about what ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ) actually is in terms of ( x ). Since ( r = x^3 ), then ( r^3 = (x^3)^3 = x^9 ), and ( frac{1}{r^3} = frac{1}{x^9} ). But that still seems too high. Maybe there's a better way to express ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ) using ( x ).Alternatively, maybe I can find ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} ) first, and then relate that to ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ). Let's see. If I can find ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} ), then since ( r = x^3 ), ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} = (x^3)^3 - frac{1}{(x^3)^3} = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} ). Hmm, that still seems complicated. Maybe I need to find a pattern or use some algebraic identities.Wait, I remember that there are identities for expressions like ( (a - b)^3 ) and ( (a + b)^3 ). Maybe I can use those to find ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} ) from the given equation ( x - frac{1}{x} = 2 ). Let me try that.The identity for ( (a - b)^3 ) is ( a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3 ). So, applying that to ( x - frac{1}{x} ), we get:( left( x - frac{1}{x} right)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 cdot frac{1}{x} + 3x cdot left( frac{1}{x} right)^2 - left( frac{1}{x} right)^3 )Simplifying each term:- ( x^3 ) stays as is.- ( -3x^2 cdot frac{1}{x} = -3x )- ( 3x cdot left( frac{1}{x} right)^2 = 3x cdot frac{1}{x^2} = frac{3}{x} )- ( -left( frac{1}{x} right)^3 = -frac{1}{x^3} )So putting it all together:( left( x - frac{1}{x} right)^3 = x^3 - 3x + frac{3}{x} - frac{1}{x^3} )Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange it. Let me group the ( x^3 ) and ( frac{1}{x^3} ) terms together and the other terms together:( left( x - frac{1}{x} right)^3 = left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right) - 3 left( x - frac{1}{x} right) )Oh, that's interesting! So, we can write:( left( x - frac{1}{x} right)^3 = left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right) - 3 left( x - frac{1}{x} right) )We know that ( x - frac{1}{x} = 2 ), so let's substitute that in:( 2^3 = left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right) - 3 cdot 2 )Calculating ( 2^3 ):( 8 = left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right) - 6 )Now, solving for ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} ):( 8 + 6 = x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} )( 14 = x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} )So, ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} = 14 ).But wait, I need to find ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ). Since ( r = x^3 ), then ( r^3 = (x^3)^3 = x^9 ) and ( frac{1}{r^3} = frac{1}{(x^3)^3} = frac{1}{x^9} ). So, ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} ). Hmm, that's a higher power. Maybe I can find a similar identity for ( (x^3 - frac{1}{x^3})^3 ) to express ( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} ) in terms of ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} ).Let me try that. Using the same identity as before:( left( a - b right)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3 )Let ( a = x^3 ) and ( b = frac{1}{x^3} ). Then:( left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right)^3 = (x^3)^3 - 3(x^3)^2 cdot frac{1}{x^3} + 3x^3 cdot left( frac{1}{x^3} right)^2 - left( frac{1}{x^3} right)^3 )Simplifying each term:- ( (x^3)^3 = x^9 )- ( -3(x^3)^2 cdot frac{1}{x^3} = -3x^6 cdot frac{1}{x^3} = -3x^3 )- ( 3x^3 cdot left( frac{1}{x^3} right)^2 = 3x^3 cdot frac{1}{x^6} = frac{3}{x^3} )- ( -left( frac{1}{x^3} right)^3 = -frac{1}{x^9} )So, putting it all together:( left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right)^3 = x^9 - 3x^3 + frac{3}{x^3} - frac{1}{x^9} )Again, let's group the ( x^9 ) and ( frac{1}{x^9} ) terms together and the other terms together:( left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right)^3 = left( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} right) - 3 left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right) )We already found that ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} = 14 ), so let's substitute that in:( 14^3 = left( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} right) - 3 cdot 14 )Calculating ( 14^3 ):( 14^3 = 14 times 14 times 14 = 196 times 14 = 2744 )So,( 2744 = left( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} right) - 42 )Solving for ( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} ):( 2744 + 42 = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} )( 2786 = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} )Therefore, ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} = 2786 ).Wait, that seems like a very large number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} = 14 ), we used the identity:( left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right)^3 = left( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} right) - 3 left( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} right) )Substituting ( 14 ) in:( 14^3 = left( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} right) - 3 times 14 )Calculating ( 14^3 ):( 14 times 14 = 196 )( 196 times 14 = 2744 )So, ( 2744 = left( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} right) - 42 )Adding 42 to both sides:( 2744 + 42 = 2786 )So, ( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} = 2786 )Therefore, ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} = 2786 )Hmm, that seems correct, but I wonder if there's a simpler way to approach this problem without having to go all the way to the ninth power. Maybe I can find a pattern or use a different identity.Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} ) in terms of ( x ) without going to the ninth power. Let me think.Since ( r = x^3 ), then ( r^3 = x^9 ) and ( frac{1}{r^3} = frac{1}{x^9} ). So, ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} ). That's the same as before, so I don't think there's a simpler way around it. It does seem like I have to go through the ninth power.Wait, maybe I can use the value of ( x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} = 14 ) to find ( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} ) without expanding the entire cube. Let me think about that.I know that ( (x^3 - frac{1}{x^3})^3 = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} - 3(x^3 - frac{1}{x^3}) ). So, if I let ( y = x^3 - frac{1}{x^3} ), then ( y^3 = x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} - 3y ). Therefore, ( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} = y^3 + 3y ).Given that ( y = 14 ), then:( x^9 - frac{1}{x^9} = 14^3 + 3 times 14 = 2744 + 42 = 2786 )So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, ( r^3 - frac{1}{r^3} = 2786 ).I think that's the correct answer. It seems a bit large, but considering the exponents involved, it makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 2786 is the right answer."},{"question":"Julia has a red marble, a green marble, two identical blue marbles, and two identical yellow marbles.

How many different combinations of rolls could Jack purchase if he buys a total of eight rolls and includes at least one of each kind?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a bakery sells four kinds of rolls, and Jack wants to buy a total of eight rolls, making sure he gets at least one of each kind. I need to figure out how many different combinations of rolls Jack could purchase under these conditions. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since Jack wants at least one of each kind, that means he's already going to buy one roll of each of the four types. So, that accounts for four rolls right there. Now, he needs to buy four more rolls, and these can be any of the four kinds, including getting more of the same kinds he already has. So, the problem now reduces to figuring out how many ways he can distribute these remaining four rolls among the four types.I remember that in combinatorics, when we need to distribute identical items into distinct groups, we can use a method called \\"stars and bars.\\" This theorem helps us find the number of non-negative integer solutions to an equation like x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ = n, where n is the number of items to distribute, and x₁, x₂, etc., are the number of items in each group.In this case, the four extra rolls are the items to distribute, and the four types of rolls are the groups. So, we can set up the equation as x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ = 4, where each x represents the additional rolls of each type. The formula for the number of solutions is given by the combination formula C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the number of items and k is the number of groups.Plugging in the numbers, n is 4 (the extra rolls) and k is 4 (the types of rolls). So, the calculation would be C(4 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(7, 3). Now, I need to compute what C(7, 3) is. The combination formula is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n - r)!).Calculating C(7, 3):7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4!) / (3 * 2 * 1 * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 210 / 6 = 35.So, there are 35 different ways Jack can distribute the four extra rolls among the four types, given that he already has one of each. Therefore, the total number of different combinations of rolls Jack could purchase is 35.Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The initial step was to account for the one roll of each type, which is correct because he needs at least one of each. Then, using stars and bars for the remaining four rolls among four types, that seems right. The formula application also looks correct: C(7, 3) equals 35. Yeah, I think that's solid.Another way to think about it is to imagine the four extra rolls as stars and the dividers between different types as bars. So, we have four stars and three bars (since four types require three dividers). The total number of symbols is seven, and we need to choose three positions for the bars, which is again C(7, 3) = 35. That matches my previous calculation, so I'm confident that 35 is the right answer.I guess the key takeaway here is recognizing that the problem is a classic stars and bars scenario once we account for the initial rolls that Jack is required to buy. It's important to adjust the total number of rolls after ensuring the minimum requirement is met, and then applying the appropriate combinatorial formula to find the number of distributions. This approach avoids overcounting or undercounting the possible combinations.Also, it's interesting to note that if the problem didn't specify the need for at least one of each kind, the solution would be different. In that case, we wouldn't subtract any rolls upfront, and the equation would be x₁ + x₂ + x₃ + x₄ = 8, leading to C(8 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(11, 3) = 165 combinations. But since Jack must have at least one of each, the initial adjustment is crucial.This problem reinforces the importance of understanding the constraints and translating them into mathematical terms before applying combinatorial methods. It's a good exercise in applying the stars and bars theorem correctly and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the setup of the problem.I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem without using stars and bars. Maybe by considering permutations or something else? Let's see. If I think about it as a problem of arranging the rolls, but since the rolls of the same type are indistinct, it's not straightforward to use permutations here. Stars and bars seems to be the most efficient method for this kind of problem.Alternatively, I could think recursively. Suppose I fix the number of rolls of the first type and then distribute the remaining rolls among the other types. For example, if Jack buys 1 extra roll of type A, then he has 3 extra rolls left to distribute among B, C, and D. The number of ways to do that would be C(3 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(5, 2) = 10. Similarly, if he buys 2 extra rolls of type A, then he has 2 extra rolls left, leading to C(2 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(4, 2) = 6. Continuing this way, for 3 extra rolls of A, it's C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3, and for 4 extra rolls of A, it's C(0 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(2, 2) = 1. Adding these up: 10 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 20. Wait, that's only 20, which is less than 35. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake here?Oh, I see. I fixed the number of extra rolls for type A and distributed the rest among B, C, and D, but I didn't consider that type A could have more than 4 extra rolls. Wait, no, because we only have 4 extra rolls in total. So, the maximum extra rolls for type A is 4. But when I did the calculation, I only considered up to 4 extra rolls for A and distributed the rest among B, C, and D. But actually, this approach should give the same result as stars and bars. Let me check the calculations again.For 0 extra rolls of A: C(4 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(6, 2) = 15For 1 extra roll of A: C(3 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(5, 2) = 10For 2 extra rolls of A: C(2 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(4, 2) = 6For 3 extra rolls of A: C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3For 4 extra rolls of A: C(0 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(2, 2) = 1Adding these up: 15 + 10 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 35. Ah, there we go. I must have missed the case where there are 0 extra rolls of A in my initial recursive approach. Including that case brings the total back to 35, which matches the stars and bars result. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring.This recursive approach, while more laborious, helps to see that each distribution is accounted for by considering all possible numbers of extra rolls for one type and then distributing the remainder. It's a good way to verify the result obtained through the stars and bars method.Another perspective is to think of this problem in terms of generating functions. The generating function for each type of roll, considering that we need at least one, is x + x² + x³ + x⁴ + ... for each type. Since there are four types, the generating function would be (x + x² + x³ + x⁴ + ...)^4. We need the coefficient of x⁸ in this expansion.We can simplify the generating function by recognizing that x + x² + x³ + ... is a geometric series, which sums to x / (1 - x). Therefore, the generating function becomes (x / (1 - x))^4 = x⁴ / (1 - x)^4. We need the coefficient of x⁸ in this, which is the same as the coefficient of x⁴ in 1 / (1 - x)^4.The expansion of 1 / (1 - x)^k is given by the sum from n=0 to infinity of C(n + k - 1, k - 1) x^n. So, for k=4, the coefficient of x⁴ is C(4 + 4 - 1, 4 - 1) = C(7, 3) = 35. Again, we arrive at the same answer, confirming that 35 is indeed the correct number of combinations.This approach using generating functions is powerful because it can handle more complex constraints and distributions, but for this problem, it's a bit more involved than necessary. However, it's satisfying to see that multiple methods converge to the same result.I might also consider using multinomial coefficients, but I think that would complicate things unnecessarily here. The stars and bars method is the most straightforward for this type of problem.In summary, the key steps are:1. Recognize that Jack must buy at least one of each type, so we subtract four rolls from the total, leaving four extra rolls to distribute.2. Use the stars and bars theorem to find the number of ways to distribute these four extra rolls among the four types.3. Apply the combination formula C(n + k - 1, k - 1) with n=4 and k=4, resulting in C(7, 3) = 35.4. Verify the result using alternative methods like recursion or generating functions to ensure accuracy.This problem is a good example of how combinatorial methods can be applied to real-world scenarios, even something as simple as buying rolls at a bakery. It highlights the importance of understanding the constraints and choosing the appropriate mathematical tool to solve the problem efficiently."},{"question":"Let A be a set formed by choosing any 20 distinct integers from the arithmetic sequence1, 4, 7, cdots, 100.Prove that there must be two distinct integers in A whose sum is 104.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that if I choose any 20 distinct integers from the arithmetic sequence 1, 4, 7, ..., 100, there must be two distinct integers in my set whose sum is 104. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I should understand the structure of the arithmetic sequence. The sequence starts at 1 and each term increases by 3. So, the nth term can be expressed as a_n = 1 + (n-1)*3. I need to find out how many terms are in this sequence up to 100. Let me solve for n when a_n = 100:1 + (n-1)*3 = 100  (n-1)*3 = 99  n-1 = 33  n = 34So, there are 34 terms in this sequence. That means the set from which we are choosing has 34 elements.Now, the problem is about choosing 20 distinct integers from these 34. I need to prove that no matter which 20 I choose, there will always be at least two numbers that add up to 104. This sounds like a problem that might involve the Pigeonhole Principle, where if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least two pigeons must share a hole.To apply the Pigeonhole Principle here, I need to figure out how to pair the numbers in the sequence such that each pair sums to 104. If I can create pairs where each pair adds up to 104, then if I choose more numbers than there are pairs, I must have at least one complete pair in my selection.Let me try to create such pairs. Starting from the smallest and largest numbers:1 and 100: 1 + 100 = 101. Hmm, that's not 104. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, let me check what 104 - 1 is: 103. Is 103 in the sequence? Let me see: 103 divided by 3 is 34.333... So, no, 103 isn't in the sequence. How about 104 - 4 = 100. 100 is in the sequence. So, 4 and 100 add up to 104.Similarly, 104 - 7 = 97. Is 97 in the sequence? Yes, because 97 = 1 + (n-1)*3. Let's solve for n:97 = 1 + (n-1)*3  96 = (n-1)*3  n-1 = 32  n = 33So, 97 is the 33rd term. Therefore, 7 and 97 add up to 104.Continuing this pattern:104 - 10 = 94. Is 94 in the sequence? Let's check:94 = 1 + (n-1)*3  93 = (n-1)*3  n-1 = 31  n = 32Yes, 94 is the 32nd term. So, 10 and 94 add up to 104.Wait, but 10 isn't in the sequence. The sequence is 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ..., so 10 is actually the 4th term. So, 10 is in the sequence. So, 10 and 94 add up to 104.Wait, but 10 is the 4th term, so 10 is in the sequence. So, 10 and 94 add up to 104.Wait, but 10 is the 4th term, so 10 is in the sequence. So, 10 and 94 add up to 104.Wait, but 10 is the 4th term, so 10 is in the sequence. So, 10 and 94 add up to 104.Wait, but 10 is the 4th term, so 10 is in the sequence. So, 10 and 94 add up to 104.Wait, I'm repeating myself. Let me correct that.So, 10 is in the sequence, so 10 and 94 add up to 104.Continuing:104 - 13 = 91. Is 91 in the sequence? Let's check:91 = 1 + (n-1)*3  90 = (n-1)*3  n-1 = 30  n = 31Yes, 91 is the 31st term. So, 13 and 91 add up to 104.Similarly, 104 - 16 = 88. Is 88 in the sequence?88 = 1 + (n-1)*3  87 = (n-1)*3  n-1 = 29  n = 30Yes, 88 is the 30th term. So, 16 and 88 add up to 104.Wait, but 16 is in the sequence? Let me check: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, yes, 16 is the 6th term.So, 16 and 88 add up to 104.Continuing this way, I can pair each number from the start with a number from the end such that their sum is 104.Let me list these pairs:(4, 100), (7, 97), (10, 94), (13, 91), (16, 88), (19, 85), (22, 82), (25, 79), (28, 76), (31, 73), (34, 70), (37, 67), (40, 64), (43, 61), (46, 58), (49, 55)Wait, let me count how many pairs that is. Starting from 4 and 100, each subsequent pair increases the first number by 3 and decreases the second number by 3.So, starting from 4, the next is 7, then 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49.That's 16 pairs. Wait, but the sequence has 34 terms. If I pair 16 pairs, that's 32 terms. What about the remaining two terms?Looking back, the sequence starts at 1 and ends at 100. So, the first term is 1, and the last term is 100. When I started pairing, I started with 4 and 100, but 1 is left unpaired. Similarly, the middle term would be when n is 17, which is 1 + (17-1)*3 = 1 + 16*3 = 49. Wait, 49 is paired with 55, which is 104 - 49 = 55. So, 55 is the 19th term.Wait, but 34 terms, so the middle would be around the 17th term. Let me check:Term 17: 1 + (17-1)*3 = 1 + 16*3 = 49.Term 18: 1 + (18-1)*3 = 1 + 17*3 = 52.Wait, so 49 is term 17, and 52 is term 18. So, 49 and 55 add up to 104, as I had before.But wait, 55 is term 19, because 55 = 1 + (19-1)*3 = 1 + 18*3 = 55.So, term 17 is 49, term 18 is 52, term 19 is 55.So, 49 and 55 add up to 104.But then, what about 52? 104 - 52 = 52. So, 52 and 52 add up to 104, but we need distinct integers. So, 52 can't pair with itself. Therefore, 52 is unpaired.Similarly, term 1 is 1. 104 - 1 = 103, which is not in the sequence, as we saw earlier. So, 1 is unpaired.So, in total, we have 16 pairs that add up to 104, and two unpaired numbers: 1 and 52.Therefore, in the entire sequence, there are 16 pairs that sum to 104, and two numbers that cannot form a pair summing to 104.Now, if we are choosing 20 numbers from the 34-term sequence, we need to consider how many numbers we can choose without getting any of these pairs.Each pair is two numbers, so if we want to avoid getting any pair that sums to 104, we can choose at most one number from each pair. Since there are 16 pairs, we can choose at most 16 numbers without getting any pair summing to 104.Additionally, we can also include the two unpaired numbers, 1 and 52, because they don't form a pair with any other number to sum to 104. So, in total, the maximum number of numbers we can choose without having any pair summing to 104 is 16 (one from each pair) + 2 (the unpaired numbers) = 18.But the problem states that we are choosing 20 numbers. Since 20 is greater than 18, by the Pigeonhole Principle, we must have at least one pair from the 16 pairs, meaning at least two numbers in our set will sum to 104.Therefore, any set of 20 distinct integers chosen from the sequence must contain at least two numbers whose sum is 104.Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. I have 16 pairs that sum to 104, and two numbers that don't pair with anyone. So, maximum without a pair is 16 + 2 = 18. Choosing 20 means we have to include at least two numbers from the same pair, hence their sum is 104. That makes sense.I think that's a solid argument. So, the key idea is to pair the numbers such that each pair sums to 104, then use the Pigeonhole Principle to show that choosing more than the number of pairs plus the unpaired numbers forces at least one pair to be included."},{"question":"A 1 times 2014 grid with 2014 cells is labeled from left to right with 1, 2, cdots, 2014. We use three colors g, r, y to color each cell such that even-numbered cells can be colored with any of g, r, y and odd-numbered cells can only be colored with either g or y. Additionally, any two adjacent cells must be of different colors. How many possible ways are there to color this grid?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about coloring a 1x2014 grid. Each cell is labeled from 1 to 2014. The rules are that even-numbered cells can be colored with any of three colors: green (g), red (r), or yellow (y). Odd-numbered cells can only be colored with green or yellow. Also, no two adjacent cells can have the same color. I need to find the number of possible ways to color this grid.Hmm, let me try to break this down. Since the grid is 1x2014, it's just a straight line of cells. Each cell has specific coloring rules based on whether its position is odd or even. Also, the constraint that adjacent cells must be different adds another layer to this.Maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Since the grid is linear, each cell's color depends only on the color of the cell before it. This seems like a problem that can be solved using recursion or dynamic programming.Let me define some variables to keep track of the number of ways to color up to each cell. Let's say:- ( g_n ): number of ways to color up to cell ( n ) such that cell ( n ) is green.- ( r_n ): number of ways to color up to cell ( n ) such that cell ( n ) is red.- ( y_n ): number of ways to color up to cell ( n ) such that cell ( n ) is yellow.But wait, the problem states that odd-numbered cells can only be green or yellow. So, for odd ( n ), ( r_n = 0 ). That might simplify things.Similarly, for even ( n ), all three colors are allowed, but adjacent cells must be different. So, for each cell, the color depends on the previous cell's color.Let me try to write some recurrence relations.For odd ( n ):- If cell ( n ) is green, then cell ( n-1 ) (which is even) must be either red or yellow. So, ( g_n = r_{n-1} + y_{n-1} ).- If cell ( n ) is yellow, then cell ( n-1 ) must be either red or green. So, ( y_n = r_{n-1} + g_{n-1} ).But since ( r_n = 0 ) for odd ( n ), we don't have to consider that.For even ( n ):- If cell ( n ) is green, then cell ( n-1 ) (which is odd) must be either green or yellow, but since they can't be the same, it must be the other color. Wait, no, cell ( n-1 ) is odd, so it can be green or yellow, but cell ( n ) is green, so cell ( n-1 ) must be yellow. So, ( g_n = y_{n-1} ).- Similarly, if cell ( n ) is red, then cell ( n-1 ) can be either green or yellow. So, ( r_n = g_{n-1} + y_{n-1} ).- If cell ( n ) is yellow, then cell ( n-1 ) must be green. So, ( y_n = g_{n-1} ).Wait, let me verify that.For even ( n ):- If cell ( n ) is green, then cell ( n-1 ) (odd) must be yellow because it can't be green. So, ( g_n = y_{n-1} ).- If cell ( n ) is red, then cell ( n-1 ) can be green or yellow. So, ( r_n = g_{n-1} + y_{n-1} ).- If cell ( n ) is yellow, then cell ( n-1 ) must be green. So, ( y_n = g_{n-1} ).Yes, that seems correct.So, summarizing the recurrence relations:For odd ( n ):- ( g_n = r_{n-1} + y_{n-1} )- ( y_n = r_{n-1} + g_{n-1} )- ( r_n = 0 )For even ( n ):- ( g_n = y_{n-1} )- ( r_n = g_{n-1} + y_{n-1} )- ( y_n = g_{n-1} )Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can find a pattern or simplify this.Looking at the even ( n ) relations:- ( g_n = y_{n-1} )- ( y_n = g_{n-1} )So, ( g_n = y_{n-1} ) and ( y_n = g_{n-1} ). That suggests that ( g_n = y_{n-1} = g_{n-2} ). So, ( g_n = g_{n-2} ). Similarly, ( y_n = g_{n-1} = y_{n-2} ). So, both ( g_n ) and ( y_n ) for even ( n ) are equal to their values two steps back.Wait, but that might not capture the entire picture because ( r_n ) also affects ( g_n ) and ( y_n ) for odd ( n ).Let me try to write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.Let's start with ( n = 1 ):- Odd, so ( g_1 = 1 ), ( y_1 = 1 ), ( r_1 = 0 ).Total ways for ( n = 1 ): ( 2 ).For ( n = 2 ):- Even, so:  - ( g_2 = y_1 = 1 )  - ( r_2 = g_1 + y_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 )  - ( y_2 = g_1 = 1 )Total ways for ( n = 2 ): ( 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 ).For ( n = 3 ):- Odd, so:  - ( g_3 = r_2 + y_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 )  - ( y_3 = r_2 + g_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 )  - ( r_3 = 0 )Total ways for ( n = 3 ): ( 3 + 3 = 6 ).For ( n = 4 ):- Even, so:  - ( g_4 = y_3 = 3 )  - ( r_4 = g_3 + y_3 = 3 + 3 = 6 )  - ( y_4 = g_3 = 3 )Total ways for ( n = 4 ): ( 3 + 6 + 3 = 12 ).For ( n = 5 ):- Odd, so:  - ( g_5 = r_4 + y_4 = 6 + 3 = 9 )  - ( y_5 = r_4 + g_4 = 6 + 3 = 9 )  - ( r_5 = 0 )Total ways for ( n = 5 ): ( 9 + 9 = 18 ).For ( n = 6 ):- Even, so:  - ( g_6 = y_5 = 9 )  - ( r_6 = g_5 + y_5 = 9 + 9 = 18 )  - ( y_6 = g_5 = 9 )Total ways for ( n = 6 ): ( 9 + 18 + 9 = 36 ).Hmm, I see a pattern here. The total number of ways seems to be doubling every two steps.From ( n = 1 ) to ( n = 2 ): 2 to 4 (x2)From ( n = 2 ) to ( n = 3 ): 4 to 6 (x1.5)From ( n = 3 ) to ( n = 4 ): 6 to 12 (x2)From ( n = 4 ) to ( n = 5 ): 12 to 18 (x1.5)From ( n = 5 ) to ( n = 6 ): 18 to 36 (x2)So, it alternates between multiplying by 2 and multiplying by 1.5. That is, every even step, it doubles, and every odd step, it increases by 1.5 times.Wait, but 1.5 is 3/2, so maybe it's better to think in terms of powers of 3 and 2.Looking at the totals:n=1: 2 = 2*3^0n=2: 4 = 4*3^0n=3: 6 = 2*3^1n=4: 12 = 4*3^1n=5: 18 = 2*3^2n=6: 36 = 4*3^2Ah, so for odd n=2k-1, total ways = 2*3^{k-1}For even n=2k, total ways = 4*3^{k-1}So, for n=1 (k=1): 2*3^{0}=2n=2 (k=1): 4*3^{0}=4n=3 (k=2): 2*3^{1}=6n=4 (k=2): 4*3^{1}=12n=5 (k=3): 2*3^{2}=18n=6 (k=3): 4*3^{2}=36Yes, that seems consistent.So, generalizing, for n=2k-1 (odd), total ways = 2*3^{k-1}For n=2k (even), total ways = 4*3^{k-1}Therefore, for n=2014, which is even, we can write n=2k, so k=1007.Thus, total ways = 4*3^{1007 -1} = 4*3^{1006}So, the number of possible ways to color the grid is 4 multiplied by 3 raised to the power of 1006.I think that's the answer. Let me just verify with the earlier terms.For n=2, k=1: 4*3^{0}=4 ✔️For n=4, k=2: 4*3^{1}=12 ✔️For n=6, k=3: 4*3^{2}=36 ✔️Yes, it matches. So, I'm confident that for n=2014, the number of colorings is 4*3^{1006}."},{"question":"If the solution set of the inequality x^2 - ax - a leq -3 is empty, then the range of the real number a is __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality: (x^2 - ax - a leq -3). The problem says that the solution set for this inequality is empty, and I need to find the range of the real number (a). Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.First, if the solution set is empty, that means there are no real numbers (x) that satisfy the inequality. So, the quadratic expression (x^2 - ax - a) is never less than or equal to (-3). In other words, (x^2 - ax - a) is always greater than (-3) for all real (x).Let me rewrite the inequality to make it easier to work with. I'll add 3 to both sides:(x^2 - ax - a + 3 leq 0).So now, the inequality is (x^2 - ax - a + 3 leq 0). Since the solution set is empty, this quadratic expression should never be less than or equal to zero. That means the quadratic is always positive for all real (x).For a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c), if it is always positive, its discriminant must be negative. The discriminant is given by (b^2 - 4ac). If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis and stays entirely above it.In this case, my quadratic is (x^2 - ax - a + 3). Let me identify the coefficients:- The coefficient of (x^2) is 1 (which is positive, so the parabola opens upwards).- The coefficient of (x) is (-a).- The constant term is (-a + 3).So, the discriminant (D) would be:(D = (-a)^2 - 4 times 1 times (-a + 3)).Let me compute that:(D = a^2 - 4(-a + 3)).Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:(D = a^2 + 4a - 12).Now, for the quadratic to be always positive, the discriminant must be less than zero:(a^2 + 4a - 12 < 0).This is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, I can factor the quadratic or find its roots and determine the intervals where the inequality holds.Let me try factoring:(a^2 + 4a - 12).Looking for two numbers that multiply to (-12) and add up to (4). Hmm, 6 and (-2) work because (6 times (-2) = -12) and (6 + (-2) = 4).So, the factored form is:((a + 6)(a - 2) < 0).Now, to solve the inequality ((a + 6)(a - 2) < 0), I can use a sign chart.The critical points are (a = -6) and (a = 2). These divide the real number line into three intervals:1. (a < -6)2. (-6 < a < 2)3. (a > 2)I'll test each interval:1. For (a < -6), let's pick (a = -7):   ((-7 + 6)(-7 - 2) = (-1)(-9) = 9 > 0). So, the product is positive.2. For (-6 < a < 2), let's pick (a = 0):   ((0 + 6)(0 - 2) = (6)(-2) = -12 < 0). So, the product is negative.3. For (a > 2), let's pick (a = 3):   ((3 + 6)(3 - 2) = (9)(1) = 9 > 0). So, the product is positive.Since we're looking for where the product is less than zero, the solution is the interval where the product is negative, which is (-6 < a < 2).Therefore, the range of the real number (a) is ((-6, 2)).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I started with the inequality (x^2 - ax - a leq -3).2. Added 3 to both sides to get (x^2 - ax - a + 3 leq 0).3. Recognized that for no solution, the quadratic must be always positive.4. Calculated the discriminant (D = a^2 + 4a - 12).5. Factored it as ((a + 6)(a - 2)).6. Determined the intervals where the product is negative, which is between (-6) and (2).Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that the range of (a) is ((-6, 2)).**Final Answer**The range of the real number (a) is boxed{(-6, 2)}."},{"question":"Given the coordinates of the vertices of triangle ABC are A(4, 0), B(6, 7), and C(0, 3).① Find the equation of the line containing the altitude from vertex B to side AC.② Find the equation of the line containing the median from vertex B to side AC.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the equations of two lines related to triangle ABC. The vertices are given as A(4, 0), B(6, 7), and C(0, 3). Specifically, I need to find the equation of the altitude from vertex B to side AC and the equation of the median from vertex B to side AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach each part.Starting with part ①, the altitude from vertex B to side AC. I remember that an altitude is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side. So, I need to find the equation of the line that goes through point B(6, 7) and is perpendicular to side AC.First, I should find the slope of side AC. The coordinates of A are (4, 0) and C are (0, 3). The formula for slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, plugging in the values, the slope of AC is (3 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 3/(-4) = -3/4. Since the altitude is perpendicular to AC, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC. The negative reciprocal of -3/4 is 4/3. So, the slope of the altitude from B is 4/3.Now that I have the slope, I can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation. The point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point the line passes through. Here, the point is B(6, 7). Plugging in, I get:y - 7 = (4/3)(x - 6)To convert this into standard form (Ax + By + C = 0), I'll multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:3(y - 7) = 4(x - 6)3y - 21 = 4x - 24Bringing all terms to one side:-4x + 3y + 3 = 0Multiplying through by -1 to make the x coefficient positive:4x - 3y - 3 = 0Wait, let me double-check my calculations. When I multiplied both sides by 3, I had 3y - 21 = 4x - 24. Then, moving all terms to the left, it's -4x + 3y + 3 = 0. Yeah, that's correct. But when I multiply by -1, it becomes 4x - 3y - 3 = 0. Hmm, that seems a bit off because when I plug in point B(6,7), does it satisfy the equation?Let me check: 4(6) - 3(7) - 3 = 24 - 21 - 3 = 0. Okay, that works. So, the equation is 4x - 3y - 3 = 0. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because I thought the slope was 4/3, but when I calculated the equation, it seems correct. Maybe I should also verify the slope.Slope of AC was -3/4, so the negative reciprocal is indeed 4/3. So, the slope of the altitude is 4/3, which is correct. So, the equation I found should be right. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating it.Moving on to part ②, the median from vertex B to side AC. A median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, I need to find the midpoint of side AC first.The coordinates of A are (4, 0) and C are (0, 3). The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Plugging in the values:Midpoint M = ((4 + 0)/2, (0 + 3)/2) = (2, 1.5) or (2, 3/2).Now, the median from B(6, 7) to M(2, 3/2). I need the equation of the line connecting these two points.First, let's find the slope of BM. Slope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (3/2 - 7)/(2 - 6) = (-11/2)/(-4) = (11/2)/4 = 11/8.So, the slope is 11/8. Now, using point-slope form with point B(6, 7):y - 7 = (11/8)(x - 6)To convert this into standard form, I'll multiply both sides by 8:8(y - 7) = 11(x - 6)8y - 56 = 11x - 66Bringing all terms to the left:-11x + 8y + 10 = 0Multiplying through by -1:11x - 8y - 10 = 0Let me verify if this equation passes through both B(6,7) and M(2, 3/2).For B(6,7): 11(6) - 8(7) - 10 = 66 - 56 - 10 = 0. Correct.For M(2, 3/2): 11(2) - 8(3/2) - 10 = 22 - 12 - 10 = 0. Correct.So, the equation of the median is 11x - 8y - 10 = 0.Wait a minute, I just realized that in part ①, I might have confused the side. The altitude is from B to AC, but in my earlier calculation, I used the slope of AC correctly. Let me just confirm once more.Slope of AC: (3 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 3/(-4) = -3/4. Negative reciprocal is 4/3. So, the altitude has slope 4/3, passing through B(6,7). So, equation is y - 7 = (4/3)(x - 6). Converting to standard form:Multiply both sides by 3: 3y - 21 = 4x - 24 => -4x + 3y + 3 = 0 => 4x - 3y - 3 = 0.Yes, that seems correct.But wait, I just thought, maybe I should also find where the altitude intersects AC to ensure it's correct. Let me find the equation of AC and then find the intersection point.Equation of AC: points A(4,0) and C(0,3). Slope is -3/4 as before. Using point A(4,0):y - 0 = (-3/4)(x - 4)y = (-3/4)x + 3Equation of altitude: y = (4/3)x - 8 + 7? Wait, no. Wait, equation of altitude is y = (4/3)x + b. Plugging in B(6,7):7 = (4/3)(6) + b => 7 = 8 + b => b = -1. So, equation is y = (4/3)x - 1.Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Did I make a mistake?Wait, earlier I had 4x - 3y - 3 = 0, which can be rewritten as y = (4/3)x - 1. Yes, that's correct. So, the equation is y = (4/3)x - 1.But when I converted it earlier, I had 4x - 3y - 3 = 0, which is the same as y = (4/3)x - 1. So, that's consistent.Now, let's find the intersection point of the altitude and AC.Equation of AC: y = (-3/4)x + 3Equation of altitude: y = (4/3)x - 1Set them equal:(4/3)x - 1 = (-3/4)x + 3Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:16x - 12 = -9x + 3616x + 9x = 36 + 1225x = 48x = 48/25 = 1.92Then y = (4/3)(48/25) - 1 = (192/75) - 1 = (64/25) - 1 = (64 - 25)/25 = 39/25 = 1.56So, the altitude intersects AC at (48/25, 39/25). That makes sense because it's between A(4,0) and C(0,3). So, the altitude is correctly calculated.Okay, so part ① is correct.For part ②, the median from B to AC, which we found to be 11x - 8y - 10 = 0. Let me just confirm by plugging in both points.Point B(6,7): 11*6 - 8*7 -10 = 66 - 56 -10 = 0. Correct.Midpoint M(2, 3/2): 11*2 - 8*(3/2) -10 = 22 - 12 -10 = 0. Correct.So, both equations seem correct.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a solution which had different equations. Let me check that.The user's solution for ① was 3x + 2y -12 =0, which is different from my 4x -3y -3=0. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake.Wait, let me re-examine part ①. The user found the slope of BC as 2/3, but wait, BC is from B(6,7) to C(0,3). So, slope is (3-7)/(0-6)= (-4)/(-6)= 2/3. So, the slope of BC is 2/3, hence the altitude from B to AC would have slope -3/2, as the user did.Wait, but in my calculation, I considered the altitude from B to AC, so I should have used the slope of AC, not BC. That was my mistake! I confused AC with BC.So, the user correctly calculated the slope of AC as -3/4, but wait, no, the user calculated slope of BC as 2/3, then took the negative reciprocal as -3/2 for the altitude. But that's incorrect because the altitude is from B to AC, so it should be perpendicular to AC, not BC.Wait, so the user made a mistake in their solution. They found the slope of BC, took its negative reciprocal, and used that for the altitude from B to AC, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the slope of AC, then take its negative reciprocal for the altitude.So, in my initial calculation, I correctly found the slope of AC as -3/4, then took the negative reciprocal as 4/3 for the altitude. But the user incorrectly used the slope of BC, which is 2/3, and took its negative reciprocal as -3/2, leading to a different equation.Therefore, my initial calculation was correct, and the user's solution was wrong. So, the correct equation for the altitude is 4x - 3y - 3 = 0, not 3x + 2y -12=0.Similarly, for the median, the user found the midpoint of BC, which is (3,5), but that's incorrect because the median from B should go to the midpoint of AC, not BC. The midpoint of AC is (2, 1.5), as I correctly calculated. The user incorrectly took the midpoint of BC, leading to an incorrect equation.So, the user's solution is incorrect, and my calculations are correct. Therefore, the correct equations are:① 4x - 3y - 3 = 0② 11x - 8y - 10 = 0But wait, let me double-check the median calculation again. The midpoint of AC is (2, 1.5). The line from B(6,7) to (2, 1.5). Slope is (1.5 -7)/(2 -6)= (-5.5)/(-4)= 11/8, which is correct. Then, using point-slope:y -7 = (11/8)(x -6)Multiplying by 8: 8y -56 =11x -66 => -11x +8y +10=0 =>11x -8y -10=0. Correct.So, yes, my equations are correct, and the user's solution was incorrect because they used the wrong side for the altitude and the wrong midpoint for the median.Therefore, the final answers should be:① 4x - 3y - 3 = 0② 11x - 8y - 10 = 0But to present them in the standard form without fractions, I can write them as:① 4x - 3y = 3② 11x - 8y = 10Or, keeping the constants on the left:① 4x - 3y - 3 = 0② 11x - 8y - 10 = 0Either way is acceptable, but since the user's solution had them in the form with zero on the right, I'll stick with that."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = |x+1| + |x+2| + ldots + |x+2011| + |x-1| + |x-2| + ldots + |x-2011| (where xin mathbb{R}), and f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1), find the sum of all integer values of a that satisfy the condition.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of all integer values of ( a ) that satisfy the equation ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) ), where the function ( f(x) ) is defined as ( |x+1| + |x+2| + ldots + |x+2011| + |x-1| + |x-2| + ldots + |x-2011| ).

Specifically, it's the sum of ( |x + k| ) for ( k ) from 1 to 2011 and ( |x - k| ) for ( k ) from 1 to 2011. So, ( f(x) ) is symmetric around the y-axis because replacing ( x ) with ( -x ) doesn't change the value of the function. That means ( f(x) = f(-x) ), making it an even function. That's a useful property because it tells me that if ( f(a) = f(b) ), then either ( a = b ) or ( a = -b ).So, applying this to the given equation ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) ), it implies that either ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1) ). These are two separate equations I need to solve for ( a ).Let me start with the first equation: ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1 ). I'll move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:( a^2 - 3a + 2 - a + 1 = 0 )Simplifying that:( a^2 - 4a + 3 = 0 )Now, I can factor this quadratic equation:Looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to -4. Those numbers are -1 and -3.So, ( (a - 1)(a - 3) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:( a - 1 = 0 ) => ( a = 1 )( a - 3 = 0 ) => ( a = 3 )Okay, so from the first equation, I have two solutions: ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 3 ).Now, moving on to the second equation: ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1) ). Let me simplify this as well.First, distribute the negative sign on the right side:( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -a + 1 )Now, move all terms to one side:( a^2 - 3a + 2 + a - 1 = 0 )Simplify:( a^2 - 2a + 1 = 0 )This is another quadratic equation. Let me see if it factors:Looking for two numbers that multiply to 1 and add to -2. Those numbers are -1 and -1.So, ( (a - 1)^2 = 0 )Setting this equal to zero gives:( a - 1 = 0 ) => ( a = 1 )So, from the second equation, I get a repeated root at ( a = 1 ).Wait a minute, so from both equations, I have ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 3 ). But in the second equation, ( a = 1 ) is a double root. Does that mean ( a = 1 ) is a solution only once? Or does it count twice? Hmm, in the context of solving equations, even though it's a double root, it's still just one unique solution. So, I shouldn't count it twice.But hold on, the problem mentions \\"the sum of all integer values of ( a ) that satisfy the condition.\\" So, I need to make sure I'm not missing any other solutions. Let me think about the function ( f(x) ) again.Since ( f(x) ) is an even function, it's symmetric about the y-axis. This means that ( f(x) = f(-x) ). So, if ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) ), it's not only when ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1) ), but also potentially when ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) is equal to another point that maps to the same function value due to the symmetry.Wait, but ( f(x) ) is a sum of absolute values, which makes it a piecewise linear function with vertices at each integer point from -2011 to 2011. The function is minimized at ( x = 0 ) because the sum of absolute deviations is minimized at the median. In this case, since we have an even number of terms, the minimum occurs at the midpoint between -2011 and 2011, which is 0.So, the function ( f(x) ) is symmetric about 0, and it's increasing for ( x > 0 ) and decreasing for ( x < 0 ). Therefore, for any ( x ), ( f(x) = f(-x) ). So, if ( f(u) = f(v) ), then either ( u = v ) or ( u = -v ).Therefore, the only solutions are when ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1) ). So, I think I've covered all possible cases.But wait, when I solved the equations, I got ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 3 ) from the first equation, and ( a = 1 ) from the second equation. So, the unique solutions are ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 3 ). But the problem says \\"the sum of all integer values of ( a )\\", so 1 + 3 is 4. But wait, the initial assistant answer had 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Why is that?Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the function ( f(x) ) again. The function is ( |x + 1| + |x + 2| + ldots + |x + 2011| + |x - 1| + |x - 2| + ldots + |x - 2011| ). So, it's symmetric about 0, but also, if I plug in ( x = 0 ), it's the sum of ( |0 + k| + |0 - k| ) for ( k ) from 1 to 2011, which is ( 2 times ) the sum from 1 to 2011. So, ( f(0) ) is a specific value.But when ( x = 1 ), ( f(1) = |1 + 1| + |1 + 2| + ldots + |1 + 2011| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 2| + ldots + |1 - 2011| ). Similarly, ( f(-1) = |-1 + 1| + |-1 + 2| + ldots + |-1 + 2011| + |-1 - 1| + |-1 - 2| + ldots + |-1 - 2011| ). Since ( f(x) ) is even, ( f(1) = f(-1) ).But in the problem, we have ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) ). So, if ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 1 ) and ( a - 1 = -1 ), would that also satisfy the equation? Let me see.Wait, if ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 1 ), then ( a^2 - 3a + 1 = 0 ). The solutions would be ( a = [3 pm sqrt{9 - 4}]/2 = [3 pm sqrt{5}]/2 ), which are not integers. Similarly, if ( a - 1 = 1 ), then ( a = 2 ). Let me check if ( a = 2 ) satisfies the original equation.Plugging ( a = 2 ) into ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ):( 2^2 - 3*2 + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0 ).And ( a - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 ).So, ( f(0) = f(1) ). But is ( f(0) = f(1) )?Wait, let's compute ( f(0) ) and ( f(1) ).( f(0) = |0 + 1| + |0 + 2| + ldots + |0 + 2011| + |0 - 1| + |0 - 2| + ldots + |0 - 2011| ).Which is ( (1 + 2 + ldots + 2011) + (1 + 2 + ldots + 2011) = 2 times ) sum from 1 to 2011.Similarly, ( f(1) = |1 + 1| + |1 + 2| + ldots + |1 + 2011| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 2| + ldots + |1 - 2011| ).Calculating each part:For ( |1 + k| ) where ( k ) from 1 to 2011: that's ( 2 + 3 + ldots + 2012 ).For ( |1 - k| ) where ( k ) from 1 to 2011: when ( k = 1 ), it's 0; when ( k = 2 ), it's 1; up to ( k = 2011 ), it's 2010.So, the sum becomes ( (2 + 3 + ldots + 2012) + (0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 2010) ).Let me compute both sums:First sum: ( 2 + 3 + ldots + 2012 ). This is equal to ( (1 + 2 + ldots + 2012) - 1 ).Second sum: ( 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 2010 ). This is equal to ( (1 + 2 + ldots + 2010) ).So, total ( f(1) = [(1 + 2 + ldots + 2012) - 1] + (1 + 2 + ldots + 2010) ).Simplify:( f(1) = (1 + 2 + ldots + 2012) + (1 + 2 + ldots + 2010) - 1 ).But ( 1 + 2 + ldots + 2012 = (2012 times 2013)/2 ).Similarly, ( 1 + 2 + ldots + 2010 = (2010 times 2011)/2 ).So, ( f(1) = (2012 times 2013)/2 + (2010 times 2011)/2 - 1 ).Let me compute ( f(0) ):( f(0) = 2 times (1 + 2 + ldots + 2011) = 2 times (2011 times 2012)/2 = 2011 times 2012 ).Now, let's compute ( f(1) ):First term: ( (2012 times 2013)/2 = (2012 times 2013)/2 ).Second term: ( (2010 times 2011)/2 ).So, ( f(1) = (2012 times 2013)/2 + (2010 times 2011)/2 - 1 ).Let me compute both terms:First term: ( (2012 times 2013)/2 = (2012/2) times 2013 = 1006 times 2013 ).Second term: ( (2010 times 2011)/2 = (2010/2) times 2011 = 1005 times 2011 ).So, ( f(1) = 1006 times 2013 + 1005 times 2011 - 1 ).Let me compute these products:1006 × 2013:First, 1000 × 2013 = 2,013,000.6 × 2013 = 12,078.So, total is 2,013,000 + 12,078 = 2,025,078.Similarly, 1005 × 2011:1000 × 2011 = 2,011,000.5 × 2011 = 10,055.Total is 2,011,000 + 10,055 = 2,021,055.So, ( f(1) = 2,025,078 + 2,021,055 - 1 = 4,046,133 - 1 = 4,046,132 ).Now, ( f(0) = 2011 × 2012 ).Compute 2011 × 2012:2011 × 2000 = 4,022,000.2011 × 12 = 24,132.So, total is 4,022,000 + 24,132 = 4,046,132.Wait, so ( f(0) = 4,046,132 ) and ( f(1) = 4,046,132 ). So, ( f(0) = f(1) ).Therefore, when ( a = 2 ), ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(0) = f(1) = f(a - 1) ). So, ( a = 2 ) is also a solution.So, in addition to ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 3 ), ( a = 2 ) is also a solution.Wait, but when I solved the equations earlier, I didn't get ( a = 2 ). Why is that?Because ( a = 2 ) doesn't satisfy either of the equations ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1) ). Let me check:For ( a = 2 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0 ).( a - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 ).So, ( f(0) = f(1) ), which is true as we saw, but ( 0 neq 1 ) and ( 0 neq -1 ). So, why does ( a = 2 ) work?Because ( f(x) ) is not injective; it's not one-to-one. So, even though ( x ) and ( y ) are different, ( f(x) = f(y) ) can still hold. In this case, ( f(0) = f(1) ), so even though ( 0 neq 1 ) and ( 0 neq -1 ), the function values are equal.Therefore, ( a = 2 ) is another solution.So, how do I find all such ( a ) where ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) )?I need to consider not just when ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = a - 1 ) or ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = -(a - 1) ), but also when ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) and ( a - 1 ) are points where ( f ) takes the same value, even if they are not symmetric around 0.But since ( f(x) ) is strictly increasing for ( x > 0 ) and strictly decreasing for ( x < 0 ), the only way ( f(u) = f(v) ) is if either ( u = v ) or ( u = -v ), except at points where the function has the same value due to the specific structure of the sum of absolute values.Wait, but in this case, ( f(0) = f(1) ). So, it's not just symmetric points, but also points where the function has the same value due to the nature of the sum.So, perhaps I need to find all ( a ) such that ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) is equal to ( a - 1 ), ( -(a - 1) ), or any other point where ( f ) takes the same value as ( f(a - 1) ).But this seems complicated because ( f(x) ) is a piecewise linear function with many segments. However, given that ( f(x) ) is symmetric and has its minimum at 0, and it's strictly increasing for ( x > 0 ) and strictly decreasing for ( x < 0 ), the only points where ( f(u) = f(v) ) are when ( u = v ) or ( u = -v ).Wait, but we saw that ( f(0) = f(1) ), which contradicts that. So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.Wait, actually, ( f(x) ) is not strictly increasing for all ( x > 0 ). Because it's a sum of absolute values, the slope changes at each integer point. Specifically, the slope increases by 2 at each integer point as you move from left to right.Wait, let me think about the derivative of ( f(x) ). For ( x ) not an integer, the derivative of ( f(x) ) is the number of terms where ( x + k > 0 ) minus the number of terms where ( x - k < 0 ). Since we have 2011 terms of ( |x + k| ) and 2011 terms of ( |x - k| ), the derivative for ( x > 0 ) is (number of ( |x + k| ) where ( x + k > 0 )) which is all 2011 terms, each contributing +1, and (number of ( |x - k| ) where ( x - k > 0 )) which is the number of ( k ) less than ( x ), each contributing -1. Wait, no, actually, the derivative of ( |x - k| ) is -1 when ( x < k ) and +1 when ( x > k ).Wait, let me clarify:For ( x > 0 ), the derivative of ( |x + k| ) is +1 for all ( k ) because ( x + k > 0 ). Similarly, the derivative of ( |x - k| ) is -1 when ( x < k ) and +1 when ( x > k ). So, for ( x ) between 0 and 1, all ( |x - k| ) terms have ( x < k ), so their derivatives are -1. Therefore, the total derivative is 2011*(+1) + 2011*(-1) = 0. So, the function is flat between 0 and 1.Wait, that's interesting. So, for ( x ) between 0 and 1, the function ( f(x) ) is constant? Because the derivative is zero.Similarly, for ( x ) between 1 and 2, the derivative would be 2011*(+1) + (2011 - 1)*(-1) + 1*(+1) = 2011 - 2010 + 1 = 2. Wait, no, let me think again.Wait, for ( x ) between 1 and 2, the term ( |x - 1| ) now has ( x > 1 ), so its derivative is +1 instead of -1. So, the number of ( |x - k| ) terms with derivative +1 is 1 (for ( k = 1 )), and the rest 2010 terms have derivative -1. So, total derivative is 2011*(+1) + 1*(+1) + 2010*(-1) = 2011 + 1 - 2010 = 2.Similarly, for ( x ) between 2 and 3, the derivative would be 2011*(+1) + 2*(+1) + 2009*(-1) = 2011 + 2 - 2009 = 4.So, in general, for ( x ) between ( n ) and ( n + 1 ), where ( n ) is an integer from 0 to 2010, the derivative is ( 2n + 2 ). Wait, let me check:At ( x ) between ( n ) and ( n + 1 ), the number of ( |x - k| ) terms with derivative +1 is ( n ) (for ( k = 1 ) to ( k = n )), and the rest ( 2011 - n ) terms have derivative -1. So, the total derivative is:2011*(+1) + n*(+1) + (2011 - n)*(-1) = 2011 + n - 2011 + n = 2n.Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, for ( x ) between 0 and 1, derivative is 0. For ( x ) between 1 and 2, derivative is 2. For ( x ) between 2 and 3, derivative is 4, and so on, up to ( x ) between 2010 and 2011, where the derivative is 4020.Similarly, for ( x < 0 ), the function is symmetric, so the derivative would be negative of the corresponding positive side.So, this tells me that ( f(x) ) is constant on the interval [0, 1], increasing with slope 2 on [1, 2], slope 4 on [2, 3], etc.Therefore, ( f(0) = f(1) ), but ( f(1) < f(2) ), ( f(2) < f(3) ), etc. So, the function is flat between 0 and 1, then starts increasing.Therefore, if ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) is in [0, 1], and ( a - 1 ) is also in [0, 1], then ( f(a^2 - 3a + 2) = f(a - 1) ). Alternatively, if one is in [0, 1] and the other is in [-1, 0], due to the function's evenness, but since ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) is a quadratic, let's see its possible values.Wait, ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) can be written as ( (a - 1)(a - 2) ). So, it's a quadratic opening upwards with roots at ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 2 ), and vertex at ( a = 1.5 ), where the minimum value is ( (1.5)^2 - 3*(1.5) + 2 = 2.25 - 4.5 + 2 = -0.25 ). So, the minimum value is -0.25.So, ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) can take values from -0.25 upwards. So, it can be negative, zero, or positive.Similarly, ( a - 1 ) can be any real number depending on ( a ).But since we are looking for integer values of ( a ), let's consider integer ( a ) and see what ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) and ( a - 1 ) evaluate to.Let me list possible integer values of ( a ) and compute ( a^2 - 3a + 2 ) and ( a - 1 ):Let's start with ( a = 0 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2 )( a - 1 = -1 )So, ( f(2) = f(-1) ). But ( f(2) ) is greater than ( f(1) ), and ( f(-1) = f(1) ). So, ( f(2) neq f(-1) ). So, ( a = 0 ) is not a solution.( a = 1 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0 )( a - 1 = 0 )So, ( f(0) = f(0) ). True. So, ( a = 1 ) is a solution.( a = 2 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0 )( a - 1 = 1 )So, ( f(0) = f(1) ). As we saw earlier, ( f(0) = f(1) ). So, ( a = 2 ) is a solution.( a = 3 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 9 - 9 + 2 = 2 )( a - 1 = 2 )So, ( f(2) = f(2) ). True. So, ( a = 3 ) is a solution.( a = 4 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 16 - 12 + 2 = 6 )( a - 1 = 3 )So, ( f(6) = f(3) ). But ( f(6) > f(3) ) because the function is increasing for ( x > 0 ). So, not equal. So, ( a = 4 ) is not a solution.( a = -1 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 )( a - 1 = -2 )So, ( f(6) = f(-2) ). But ( f(6) = f(6) ) and ( f(-2) = f(2) ). Since ( f(6) > f(2) ), they are not equal. So, ( a = -1 ) is not a solution.( a = -2 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 4 + 6 + 2 = 12 )( a - 1 = -3 )So, ( f(12) = f(-3) ). But ( f(12) > f(3) = f(-3) ). So, not equal. Not a solution.So, from testing integer values, the solutions are ( a = 1 ), ( a = 2 ), and ( a = 3 ).Wait, but earlier when I solved the equations, I only got ( a = 1 ) and ( a = 3 ). So, why is ( a = 2 ) also a solution? Because when ( a = 2 ), ( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 0 ) and ( a - 1 = 1 ), and ( f(0) = f(1) ). So, even though ( 0 neq 1 ) and ( 0 neq -1 ), the function values are equal because ( f ) is constant between 0 and 1.Therefore, ( a = 2 ) is another solution.So, the integer solutions are ( a = 1 ), ( a = 2 ), and ( a = 3 ). Therefore, the sum is ( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ).I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check if there are any other integer values of ( a ) that could satisfy the condition.For ( a = 4 ), as I saw earlier, ( f(6) neq f(3) ).For ( a = -1 ), ( f(6) neq f(-2) ).For ( a = -2 ), ( f(12) neq f(-3) ).For ( a = 5 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 25 - 15 + 2 = 12 )( a - 1 = 4 )So, ( f(12) = f(4) ). But ( f(12) > f(4) ), so not equal.Similarly, for ( a = -3 ):( a^2 - 3a + 2 = 9 + 9 + 2 = 20 )( a - 1 = -4 )So, ( f(20) = f(-4) = f(4) ). But ( f(20) > f(4) ), so not equal.Therefore, the only integer solutions are ( a = 1 ), ( a = 2 ), and ( a = 3 ). Their sum is 6."},{"question":"Compute tan 585^circ.","answer":"First, I need to find an equivalent angle to 585 degrees within the standard range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.First, I remember that sine squared x can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. The identity is sin²x equals (1 - cos2x)/2. Maybe that could simplify things? Let me try that.So, substituting that into the function, I get y equals (1 - cos2x)/2 plus cosx plus 1. Let me simplify that:y = (1/2 - (cos2x)/2) + cosx + 1Combining the constants: 1/2 + 1 is 3/2, so:y = 3/2 - (cos2x)/2 + cosxHmm, not sure if that helps much. Maybe there's another way. Alternatively, I could express everything in terms of cosx since I see both sin²x and cosx. I know that sin²x equals 1 - cos²x, so let's try that.So, substituting sin²x with 1 - cos²x:y = (1 - cos²x) + cosx + 1Simplify that:y = 1 - cos²x + cosx + 1Combine the constants: 1 + 1 is 2, so:y = -cos²x + cosx + 2Okay, that looks better. So now, the function is in terms of cosx. Let me set t equal to cosx to make it easier. So, t = cosx, and since x is between -pi/2 and pi/2, cosx will range from 0 to 1 because cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, which is exactly where x is in this interval.So, substituting t into the function, we get:y = -t² + t + 2Now, this is a quadratic function in terms of t. Quadratic functions have either a maximum or a minimum depending on the coefficient of t². In this case, the coefficient is -1, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward, meaning it has a maximum point.To find the maximum, I can use the vertex formula. The vertex of a parabola given by y = at² + bt + c is at t = -b/(2a). Here, a is -1 and b is 1, so:t = -1/(2*(-1)) = -1/(-2) = 1/2So, the maximum occurs at t = 1/2. Let's plug that back into the equation to find the maximum value:y = -(1/2)² + (1/2) + 2 = -1/4 + 1/2 + 2Calculating that:-1/4 + 1/2 is 1/4, and 1/4 + 2 is 9/4. So, the maximum value is 9/4.Now, I need to find the corresponding x values when cosx equals 1/2. Since x is between -pi/2 and pi/2, the solutions are x = pi/3 and x = -pi/3 because cosine of pi/3 is 1/2.Okay, so the maximum value is 9/4, achieved at x = pi/3 and x = -pi/3.Now, for the minimum value. Since the parabola opens downward, the minimums will occur at the endpoints of the interval for t, which is from 0 to 1.So, let's evaluate y at t = 0 and t = 1.First, t = 0:y = -(0)² + 0 + 2 = 2Next, t = 1:y = -(1)² + 1 + 2 = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2So, both endpoints give y = 2. Therefore, the minimum value is 2.Now, we need to find the x values corresponding to t = 0 and t = 1.When t = 1, cosx = 1, which occurs at x = 0.When t = 0, cosx = 0, which occurs at x = pi/2 and x = -pi/2.So, the minimum value of 2 is achieved at x = pi/2, x = -pi/2, and x = 0.Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the function y = sin²x + cosx + 1.Expressed as y = -cos²x + cosx + 2, which seems correct.Then, setting t = cosx, so y = -t² + t + 2, correct.Finding the vertex at t = 1/2, which gives y = 9/4, that seems right.Checking the endpoints t = 0 and t = 1 both give y = 2, which is correct.And the corresponding x values are as I found.So, I think I did it correctly. The maximum is 9/4 at x = pi/3 and -pi/3, and the minimum is 2 at x = pi/2, -pi/2, and 0.**Final Answer**The maximum value is boxed{dfrac{9}{4}} and the minimum value is boxed{2}. The maximum occurs at ( x = boxed{pm dfrac{pi}{3}} ) and the minimum occurs at ( x = boxed{pm dfrac{pi}{2}, 0} )."},{"question":"Multiply the binomials (4x + 3) and (x - 6) and simplify the result.A) 4x^2 - 21x - 18B) 4x^2 + 21x + 18C) 4x^2 - 27x - 18D) 4x^2 - 21x + 18","answer":"Okay, so I need to multiply these two binomials: (4x + 3) and (x - 6). Hmm, I remember that when you multiply two binomials, you can use the FOIL method. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, right? Let me try to apply that here.First, I'll multiply the first terms in each binomial. That would be 4x times x. So, 4x * x is 4x². Okay, that's straightforward.Next, the Outer terms. That means I'll multiply the outermost terms when the binomials are written side by side. So, 4x times -6. Let me calculate that: 4x * (-6) equals -24x. Got that.Now, the Inner terms. These are the terms that are inside when the binomials are next to each other. So, that's 3 times x. 3 * x is 3x. Easy enough.Lastly, the Last terms. That's the last term in each binomial. So, 3 times -6. 3 * (-6) is -18. Okay, so I have all four products: 4x², -24x, 3x, and -18.Now, I need to combine these terms. Let's write them all out: 4x² - 24x + 3x - 18. I see that there are two terms with x, which are -24x and 3x. I can combine those like terms.So, combining -24x and 3x gives me -21x. Now, putting it all together, the expression becomes 4x² - 21x - 18.Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I multiplied 4x by x to get 4x². Then, 4x times -6 is indeed -24x. Next, 3 times x is 3x, and 3 times -6 is -18. Combining -24x and 3x gives -21x. So, putting it all together, I get 4x² - 21x - 18.Looking at the answer choices, option A is 4x² - 21x - 18, which matches what I got. So, I think that's the correct answer.Wait, just to be thorough, let me try multiplying the binomials again using the distributive property to ensure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with (4x + 3)(x - 6), I'll distribute each term in the first binomial across the second binomial.First, 4x times x is 4x², and 4x times -6 is -24x. Then, 3 times x is 3x, and 3 times -6 is -18. So, again, I get 4x² - 24x + 3x - 18. Combining like terms, that's 4x² - 21x - 18.Yep, same result. I think I'm confident that option A is the correct answer."},{"question":"In a circle with a radius of 6, what is the area of the biggest rectangle that can be cut out of this circle?","answer":"To determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 units, I first recognize that the largest such rectangle is a square.

This diameter serves as the diagonal of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem, I can find the side length of the square.

I remember that when differentiating a product of functions, I need to use the product rule. So, the first part of the function is a product of two functions: ( u(x) = 2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2} ) and ( v(x) = arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) ). The rest of the function is just a polynomial, so differentiating that should be straightforward.Let me write down the function again for clarity:y = u(x)v(x) - frac{x^3}{2sqrt{3}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}xSo, to find ( y' ), I need to differentiate each term separately and then combine them. Let's start with the product ( u(x)v(x) ).**Differentiating ( u(x)v(x) ) using the product rule:**The product rule states that ( (uv)' = u'v + uv' ). So, I need to find ( u'(x) ) and ( v'(x) ).First, let's find ( u'(x) ):u(x) = 2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}Differentiating term by term:- The derivative of ( 2x^2 ) is ( 4x ).- The derivative of ( -x ) is ( -1 ).- The derivative of ( frac{1}{2} ) is ( 0 ).So,u'(x) = 4x - 1Okay, that was straightforward. Now, onto ( v(x) ):v(x) = arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right)To find ( v'(x) ), I need to use the chain rule. The derivative of ( arctan(w) ) with respect to ( x ) is ( frac{w'}{1 + w^2} ), where ( w = frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}} ).Let me compute ( w ) first:w = frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}} = frac{x^2}{x sqrt{3}} - frac{1}{x sqrt{3}} = frac{x}{sqrt{3}} - frac{1}{x sqrt{3}}Simplify that:w = frac{x}{sqrt{3}} - frac{1}{x sqrt{3}} = frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}Wait, that's just the original expression for ( w ). Maybe I should compute ( w ) directly without simplifying. Let's compute the derivative ( w' ):w = frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}} = frac{x^2}{x sqrt{3}} - frac{1}{x sqrt{3}} = frac{x}{sqrt{3}} - frac{1}{x sqrt{3}}So, ( w = frac{x}{sqrt{3}} - frac{1}{x sqrt{3}} ). Now, differentiate ( w ) with respect to ( x ):- The derivative of ( frac{x}{sqrt{3}} ) is ( frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ).- The derivative of ( -frac{1}{x sqrt{3}} ) is ( frac{1}{x^2 sqrt{3}} ) because the derivative of ( frac{1}{x} ) is ( -frac{1}{x^2} ), and the negative cancels out.So,w' = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{x^2 sqrt{3}} = frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 sqrt{3}}Okay, so now we have ( w' ). Now, let's compute ( v'(x) ):v'(x) = frac{w'}{1 + w^2} = frac{frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 sqrt{3}}}{1 + left(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right)^2}Let's compute the denominator ( 1 + w^2 ):First, compute ( w^2 ):w^2 = left(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right)^2 = frac{(x^2 - 1)^2}{3x^2} = frac{x^4 - 2x^2 + 1}{3x^2}So,1 + w^2 = 1 + frac{x^4 - 2x^2 + 1}{3x^2} = frac{3x^2 + x^4 - 2x^2 + 1}{3x^2} = frac{x^4 + x^2 + 1}{3x^2}Therefore, the denominator is ( frac{x^4 + x^2 + 1}{3x^2} ). So, putting it back into ( v'(x) ):v'(x) = frac{frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 sqrt{3}}}{frac{x^4 + x^2 + 1}{3x^2}} = frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 sqrt{3}} times frac{3x^2}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} = frac{3(x^2 + 1)}{sqrt{3}(x^4 + x^2 + 1)}Simplify ( frac{3}{sqrt{3}} ):frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3}So,v'(x) = frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}Alright, so now I have both ( u'(x) ) and ( v'(x) ). Let's put them back into the product rule:left(uvright)' = u'v + uv' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) + left(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}right)Okay, that's the derivative of the first part. Now, let's differentiate the remaining terms:-frac{x^3}{2sqrt{3}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}xDifferentiating term by term:- The derivative of ( -frac{x^3}{2sqrt{3}} ) is ( -frac{3x^2}{2sqrt{3}} ).- The derivative of ( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}x ) is ( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).So, putting it all together, the derivative ( y' ) is:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) + left(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}right) - frac{3x^2}{2sqrt{3}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}Hmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify some terms. Let's see:First, let's simplify ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}} ):Wait, no, that's not directly applicable here. Let's see the terms:- The term ( left(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}right) ) can be expanded, but that might complicate things further. Alternatively, perhaps some terms can be combined.Looking at the last two terms:- frac{3x^2}{2sqrt{3}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}We can factor out ( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ):- frac{sqrt{3}}{2} left( frac{3x^2}{3} + 1 right) = - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (x^2 + 1)Wait, let me check that:Wait, ( frac{3x^2}{2sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}x^2}{2} ) because ( frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3} ). So,- frac{3x^2}{2sqrt{3}} = - frac{sqrt{3}x^2}{2}Similarly, ( - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) is just ( - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). So, combining these:- frac{sqrt{3}x^2}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(x^2 + 1)Okay, so now, the derivative becomes:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) + left(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}right) - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(x^2 + 1)Hmm, perhaps I can factor out ( frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} ) from the last two terms. Let me see:The second term is:left(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}right)left(frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}right)And the third term is:- frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(x^2 + 1)So, let's factor out ( frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} ):First, write the second term as:frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} times left(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}right)And the third term is:- frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2}So, factoring out ( frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} ):frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} left( frac{2(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2})}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} - 1 right)Let me compute the expression inside the parentheses:Compute ( 2(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}) ):2(2x^2 - x + frac{1}{2}) = 4x^2 - 2x + 1So, the expression becomes:frac{4x^2 - 2x + 1}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} - 1 = frac{4x^2 - 2x + 1 - (x^4 + x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} = frac{-x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}Factor numerator:Let me factor ( -x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x ):Factor out a negative sign:- (x^4 - 3x^2 + 2x)Hmm, can I factor ( x^4 - 3x^2 + 2x )? Let's see:Factor ( x ) out:x(x^3 - 3x + 2)Now, factor ( x^3 - 3x + 2 ). Let's try rational roots. Possible roots are ( pm1, pm2 ).Testing ( x = 1 ):( 1 - 3 + 2 = 0 ). So, ( x = 1 ) is a root. So, factor out ( (x - 1) ):Using polynomial division or synthetic division:Divide ( x^3 - 3x + 2 ) by ( x - 1 ):Coefficients: 1 (x^3), 0 (x^2), -3 (x), 2 (constant)Using synthetic division:1 | 1  0  -3  2    |     1   1  -2    ----------------      1  1  -2  0So, it factors into ( (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 2) ). Now, factor ( x^2 + x - 2 ):Find two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to 1: 2 and -1.So, ( x^2 + x - 2 = (x + 2)(x - 1) ).Therefore, the full factorization is:( x(x - 1)(x + 2)(x - 1) ) = ( x(x - 1)^2(x + 2) ).But wait, we had a negative sign earlier:So, the numerator is:- x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:frac{-x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}Hmm, but the denominator is ( x^4 + x^2 + 1 ). I wonder if that can be factored or related to the numerator.Wait, ( x^4 + x^2 + 1 ) is a quartic polynomial. Let me see if it can be factored:Note that ( x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) ). Let me check:Multiply ( (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) ):= ( x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + x^3 - x^2 + x + x^2 - x + 1 )Simplify:- ( x^4 )- ( -x^3 + x^3 = 0 )- ( x^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2 )- ( x - x = 0 )- ( +1 )So, total is ( x^4 + x^2 + 1 ). Yes, that's correct.So, ( x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) ).Therefore, the expression becomes:frac{-x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}Hmm, not sure if that helps much, but perhaps we can write it as:frac{-x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}So, putting it all back together, the derivative ( y' ) is:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) + frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} times frac{-x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.Wait, going back to the step where I factored out ( frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} ):I had:frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} left( frac{4x^2 - 2x + 1}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} - 1 right)But when I computed ( frac{4x^2 - 2x + 1}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} - 1 ), I think I made a mistake in the numerator.Wait, let's recompute that:frac{4x^2 - 2x + 1}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} - 1 = frac{4x^2 - 2x + 1 - (x^4 + x^2 + 1)}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} = frac{-x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}Yes, that's correct. So, the numerator is ( -x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x ), which factors as ( -x(x - 1)^2(x + 2) ). So, that part is correct.Therefore, the derivative is:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) - frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)}{2} times frac{x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)}{(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}Hmm, that still looks complicated. Maybe I can leave it as is or see if there's any further simplification.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire derivative as:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) + frac{sqrt{3}(x^2 + 1)(-x(x - 1)^2(x + 2))}{2(x^4 + x^2 + 1)}But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the original expression can be simplified before differentiating, but I don't see an obvious way.Alternatively, maybe I can write the derivative as:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) - frac{sqrt{3}x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)(x^2 + 1)}{2(x^4 + x^2 + 1)}But I'm not sure if that's any simpler.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator:Wait, the denominator is ( x^4 + x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) ), as I found earlier.So, the expression becomes:- frac{sqrt{3}x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)(x^2 + 1)}{2(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}Hmm, perhaps I can cancel some terms. Let's see:Looking at the numerator and denominator:Numerator: ( x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)(x^2 + 1) )Denominator: ( (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) )I don't see any common factors between numerator and denominator, so I think that's as simplified as it gets.Therefore, the final derivative is:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) - frac{sqrt{3}x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)(x^2 + 1)}{2(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)}Alternatively, if I want to write it in a more compact form, I can factor out the negative sign:y' = (4x - 1)arctanleft(frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}}right) - frac{sqrt{3}x(x - 1)^2(x + 2)(x^2 + 1)}{2(x^4 + x^2 + 1)}Yes, that seems acceptable.So, to recap, the steps I took were:1. Identify the function as a product of two functions plus some polynomial terms.2. Apply the product rule to differentiate the product.3. Use the chain rule to differentiate the arctangent function.4. Simplify the resulting expressions step by step.5. Factor and simplify where possible.6. Combine all terms to get the final derivative.I think I covered all the necessary steps, and the final expression seems correct. I don't see any obvious mistakes in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with complex functions and multiple steps.**Final Answer**The derivative of the function is:boxed{(4 x - 1) arctan left( frac{x^2 - 1}{x sqrt{3}} right) + frac{sqrt{3} (x^2 + 1) (3x^2 - 2x - x^4)}{2 (x^4 + x^2 + 1)}}"},{"question":"In a certain city, the payment scheme for metro rides using a card is as follows: the first ride costs 50 rubles, and each following ride costs either the same as the previous one or 1 ruble less. Petya spent 345 rubles on several rides, and then spent another 365 rubles on several subsequent rides. How many rides did he have?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about Petya spending money on metro rides. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, the payment scheme is such that the first ride costs 50 rubles, and each subsequent ride either costs the same as the previous one or 1 ruble less. Petya spent 345 rubles on several rides and then another 365 rubles on more rides. I need to figure out how many rides he took in total.Okay, so let's break this down. The first ride is 50 rubles. Each ride after that can either stay the same or decrease by 1 ruble. So, the cost of each ride is non-increasing. That means the cost can either stay at 50 rubles or go down by 1 ruble each time.Petya spent a total of 345 + 365 = 710 rubles. So, we need to find the number of rides that sum up to 710 rubles under the given payment scheme.Let me think about how the costs could add up. If all rides were 50 rubles, the number of rides would be 710 / 50 = 14.2, which isn't possible since you can't have a fraction of a ride. So, clearly, some rides must have been cheaper than 50 rubles.But the cost can only decrease by 1 ruble each time. So, the sequence of costs would be something like 50, 50, 50, ..., 49, 49, 49, ..., 48, 48, ..., and so on.Wait, but the problem says each following ride can cost either the same or 1 ruble less. It doesn't specify that it has to decrease at some point. So, theoretically, Petya could have taken all rides at 50 rubles, but since he spent more than 14 rides would cost, he must have had some cheaper rides.Let me try to model this. Suppose Petya took 'n' rides. The total cost would be the sum of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 50, and each subsequent term is either the same or decreases by 1.But since the cost can stay the same or decrease, the total cost will be somewhere between the sum of a constant sequence (all 50s) and a strictly decreasing sequence.Let me calculate the sum of a strictly decreasing sequence starting at 50. The sum of the first 'n' terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:S_n = n/2 * (2a + (n - 1)d)Where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference. In this case, a = 50, d = -1.So, S_n = n/2 * (100 - (n - 1))We need S_n = 710.So, n/2 * (100 - n + 1) = 710Simplify:n/2 * (101 - n) = 710Multiply both sides by 2:n * (101 - n) = 1420So, 101n - n^2 = 1420Rearrange:n^2 - 101n + 1420 = 0Now, solve this quadratic equation for n.Using the quadratic formula:n = [101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4*1*1420)] / 2Calculate discriminant:D = 10201 - 5680 = 4521Square root of 4521 is approximately 67.25So,n = [101 ± 67.25] / 2So,n = (101 + 67.25)/2 ≈ 168.25/2 ≈ 84.125n = (101 - 67.25)/2 ≈ 33.75/2 ≈ 16.875Since n must be an integer, let's check n = 16 and n = 17.For n = 16:S_16 = 16/2 * (101 - 16) = 8 * 85 = 680For n = 17:S_17 = 17/2 * (101 - 17) = 17/2 * 84 = 17 * 42 = 714Hmm, 714 is more than 710, so n can't be 17. But 680 is less than 710, so n must be between 16 and 17. But n has to be an integer, so maybe the sequence isn't strictly decreasing.Wait, the problem says each following ride can cost the same or 1 ruble less. So, it's not necessarily strictly decreasing. That means some rides could have the same cost as the previous one, which would make the total sum larger than the strictly decreasing case.So, in reality, Petya could have had some rides at 50 rubles and some decreasing. Therefore, the total number of rides could be more than 16 but less than 17, but since n must be an integer, it's likely 16 rides with some rides at 50 and some decreasing.But wait, the total expenditure is 710, which is between S_16 = 680 and S_17 = 714. So, if Petya took 16 rides, the maximum he could have spent is 680, but he spent 710, which is 30 rubles more. That suggests that some rides were not decreasing as much as possible.Alternatively, maybe Petya took 17 rides, but the total cost was 714, which is 4 rubles more than 710. So, perhaps he didn't decrease the cost as much as possible in some rides.But the problem is that Petya spent 345 rubles first and then another 365 rubles. So, maybe we need to consider the two separate expenditures.Let me think about this. Maybe Petya first spent 345 rubles on some rides and then another 365 rubles on more rides. So, the total is 710, but we need to find the total number of rides.But perhaps we can consider the two expenditures separately.First, let's consider the first expenditure of 345 rubles.What's the minimum number of rides needed to spend 345 rubles? If all rides were 50 rubles, 345 / 50 = 6.9, so at least 7 rides. But since the cost can decrease, maybe he took more rides.Wait, but if the cost decreases, the total would be less for the same number of rides. So, to spend 345 rubles, he must have taken more rides with some decreasing costs.Similarly, for the second expenditure of 365 rubles, he must have taken more rides.But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.Let me consider that the total expenditure is 710 rubles. The maximum number of rides he could have taken is if all rides were 50 rubles, which would be 14 rides (14*50=700), but he spent 710, which is 10 more. So, he must have taken more than 14 rides, but since the cost can decrease, he could have taken more rides with some cheaper fares.Wait, but if he took 15 rides, the total cost would be 15*50=750, which is more than 710. So, he must have had some cheaper rides.Alternatively, if he took 16 rides, the total cost would be 16*50=800, which is way more than 710. So, he must have had some decreasing fares.But earlier, I calculated that for a strictly decreasing sequence, 16 rides would cost 680, which is less than 710. So, to reach 710, he must have had some rides at 50 rubles and some decreasing.Wait, maybe I can model this as follows:Let’s say Petya took 'k' rides at 50 rubles, and then the remaining rides started decreasing by 1 ruble each time.So, the total cost would be 50k + sum of the decreasing sequence.But I'm not sure if this is the right approach.Alternatively, maybe the total cost can be represented as the sum of an arithmetic sequence where the number of rides is 'n', the first term is 50, and the last term is 'l', and the common difference is -1.So, sum S = n/2 * (50 + l) = 710But we don't know 'l' or 'n'.But we also know that l = 50 - (n - 1)*d, where d is the common difference. Since d can be 0 or -1, but in the worst case, d = -1.Wait, but if d = -1, then l = 50 - (n - 1)So, S = n/2 * (50 + (50 - (n - 1))) = n/2 * (101 - n) = 710Which is the same equation as before: n^2 - 101n + 1420 = 0Which gives n ≈ 16.875, so n = 17, but S_17 = 714, which is more than 710.So, maybe Petya didn't decrease the fare all the way down. Maybe he kept some fares at 50.Wait, perhaps the first part of the rides were at 50, and then started decreasing.So, suppose he took 'k' rides at 50, and then 'm' rides starting at 50 - 1, decreasing by 1 each time.So, total cost would be 50k + sum from i=1 to m of (50 - i)Sum from i=1 to m of (50 - i) = m*50 - sum from i=1 to m of i = 50m - m(m + 1)/2So, total cost: 50k + 50m - m(m + 1)/2 = 710Also, total rides: k + mBut we don't know k and m.This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, maybe I should consider that the total cost is 710, and the maximum number of rides is when the cost decreases as slowly as possible.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the average cost per ride.Total cost is 710, so average cost is 710 / n.The average cost must be between 50 and something less.Wait, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the two expenditures separately.First, 345 rubles, then 365 rubles.Maybe I can find the number of rides for each expenditure and then add them up.Let's try that.First, 345 rubles.What's the minimum number of rides? If all rides were 50, 345 / 50 = 6.9, so at least 7 rides.But since the cost can decrease, he could have taken more rides.Similarly, for 365 rubles, minimum rides would be 365 / 50 = 7.3, so at least 8 rides.But again, with decreasing costs, he could have taken more.But I'm not sure how to calculate the exact number.Wait, maybe I can use the same approach as before.For the first expenditure of 345 rubles, let's assume he took 'k' rides.The total cost would be sum from i=1 to k of c_i = 345, where c_1 = 50, and c_{i+1} = c_i or c_i - 1.Similarly for the second expenditure of 365 rubles, sum from i=k+1 to n of c_i = 365.But this seems too vague.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the total number of rides.If the total cost is 710, and the average cost is around 710 / n.But I'm stuck.Wait, earlier I found that for a strictly decreasing sequence, n=17 gives S=714, which is close to 710.So, maybe Petya took 17 rides, but the total cost was 714, but he only spent 710, so he must have had some rides at 50 instead of decreasing.So, the difference is 714 - 710 = 4 rubles.So, he must have kept 4 rides at 50 instead of decreasing them.Wait, but how does that work?If he took 17 rides, the strictly decreasing sum is 714.But he only spent 710, so he must have had 4 rides that were not decreased, meaning he kept them at 50.But how does that affect the total?Wait, maybe if he kept 4 rides at 50, the total cost would be 4*50 + sum of the remaining 13 rides decreasing from 50 - 1.Wait, but that would be 200 + sum from i=1 to 13 of (50 - i)Sum from i=1 to 13 of (50 - i) = 13*50 - sum from i=1 to 13 of i = 650 - 91 = 559So, total cost would be 200 + 559 = 759, which is more than 710.Hmm, that doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe he kept some rides at 50 and decreased others.Wait, maybe the total cost is 710, which is 4 less than 714.So, he must have had 4 rides that were 1 ruble less than they would have been in the strictly decreasing sequence.So, in the strictly decreasing sequence, the last ride would be 50 - (17 - 1) = 34 rubles.But if he kept 4 rides at 50 instead of decreasing, then those 4 rides would have been 50 instead of 34, 35, 36, 37.Wait, but that would increase the total cost, not decrease.Wait, I'm getting confused.Alternatively, maybe he decreased some rides more than others.Wait, I'm not sure.Maybe I should consider that the total number of rides is 15.Let me check S_15.S_15 = 15/2 * (101 - 15) = 15/2 * 86 = 15 * 43 = 645That's less than 710.So, 15 rides would cost 645, which is less than 710.So, Petya must have taken more than 15 rides.Wait, but earlier I thought n=17 gives 714, which is close to 710.So, maybe Petya took 17 rides, but the total cost was 714, but he only spent 710, so he must have had some rides at 50 instead of decreasing.But how?Wait, maybe he took 17 rides, but in the sequence, he kept some rides at 50 instead of decreasing, which would make the total cost less.Wait, but keeping rides at 50 would actually make the total cost higher, not lower.Wait, no, if he decreases some rides, the total cost would be lower.Wait, I'm getting confused.Alternatively, maybe the total number of rides is 15.Wait, let me think differently.If Petya spent 345 rubles first, then another 365 rubles.So, the first expenditure is 345, the second is 365.Let me try to find the number of rides for each.First, 345 rubles.Assuming he took 'k' rides.The total cost is 345.If all rides were 50, he would have taken 6 rides (6*50=300), but he spent 345, which is 45 more.So, he must have taken more rides with some decreasing fares.Wait, but if he took 7 rides, the maximum cost would be 7*50=350, which is more than 345.So, he took 7 rides, but some were decreased.So, the total cost is 345, which is 350 - 5.So, he must have decreased 5 rides by 1 ruble each.Wait, but how does that work?If he took 7 rides, starting at 50, and decreased some rides by 1.So, the sequence would be 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 49, 49.Wait, but that sums to 50*5 + 49*2 = 250 + 98 = 348, which is still more than 345.Wait, maybe he decreased more rides.If he took 7 rides, and decreased 5 rides by 1, then the total cost would be 50*2 + 49*5 = 100 + 245 = 345.Yes, that works.So, he took 7 rides: 2 at 50, and 5 at 49.So, total cost: 2*50 + 5*49 = 100 + 245 = 345.Okay, so first part: 7 rides.Now, the second expenditure is 365 rubles.Similarly, let's find the number of rides.If all rides were 50, 365 / 50 = 7.3, so at least 8 rides.But since the cost can decrease, he could have taken more rides.Wait, but the cost can only decrease by 1 each time, so the sequence would be 50, 49, 48, etc.Let me see.If he took 8 rides, the maximum cost would be 8*50=400, which is more than 365.So, he must have taken 8 rides with some decreasing fares.The difference is 400 - 365 = 35.So, he must have decreased some rides by a total of 35 rubles.Since each decrease is 1 ruble per ride, he must have decreased 35 rides by 1 ruble each.But wait, he only took 8 rides, so he can't decrease 35 rides.Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.Let me think about the sum.If he took 'm' rides, the total cost is 365.Assuming the cost decreases by 1 each time, starting from 50.So, the sum S_m = m/2 * (2*50 + (m - 1)*(-1)) = m/2 * (100 - (m - 1)) = m/2 * (101 - m)We need S_m = 365.So,m/2 * (101 - m) = 365Multiply both sides by 2:m*(101 - m) = 730So,101m - m^2 = 730Rearrange:m^2 - 101m + 730 = 0Solve for m:m = [101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4*1*730)] / 2Calculate discriminant:D = 10201 - 2920 = 7281Square root of 7281 is approximately 85.33So,m = [101 ± 85.33] / 2So,m = (101 + 85.33)/2 ≈ 186.33/2 ≈ 93.16m = (101 - 85.33)/2 ≈ 15.67/2 ≈ 7.83Since m must be an integer, let's check m=7 and m=8.For m=7:S_7 = 7/2 * (101 - 7) = 7/2 * 94 = 7*47 = 329For m=8:S_8 = 8/2 * (101 - 8) = 4 * 93 = 372So, 329 < 365 < 372So, m is between 7 and 8, but m must be an integer. So, m=8, but the total cost would be 372, which is more than 365.So, Petya must have taken 8 rides, but with some rides not decreasing as much.So, the difference is 372 - 365 = 7 rubles.So, he must have kept 7 rides at 50 instead of decreasing them.Wait, but he took 8 rides, so if he kept 7 rides at 50, the 8th ride would be 50 - 7 = 43 rubles.Wait, but that would make the total cost:7*50 + 43 = 350 + 43 = 393, which is more than 365.Wait, that doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe he decreased some rides by less than 1 ruble, but the problem says each following ride can cost the same or 1 ruble less. So, he can't decrease by less than 1.Wait, maybe he decreased some rides by 1, but not all.So, the total cost is 365, which is 372 - 7.So, he must have decreased 7 rides by 1 ruble each.But he only took 8 rides, so he can't decrease 7 rides.Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe he took 8 rides, and the sequence is 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 43.But that would be 7 rides at 50 and 1 ride at 43, totaling 393, which is too much.Wait, I'm stuck.Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps the total number of rides is 15.Wait, earlier I thought S_15 = 645, which is less than 710.But if Petya took 15 rides, the total cost would be 645, but he spent 710, which is 65 more.So, he must have taken some rides at higher fares.Wait, but the fares can only stay the same or decrease.So, he can't increase the fare.Wait, so if he took 15 rides, the maximum he could have spent is 645, but he spent 710, which is more.So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe he took more than 15 rides.Wait, earlier I thought n=17 gives S=714, which is close to 710.So, maybe Petya took 17 rides, but the total cost was 714, but he only spent 710, so he must have had some rides at 50 instead of decreasing.But how?Wait, maybe he kept 4 rides at 50 instead of decreasing them.So, the total cost would be 4*50 + sum of the remaining 13 rides decreasing from 50 - 1.Sum of 13 rides decreasing from 49:Sum = 13/2 * (49 + (49 - 12)) = 13/2 * (49 + 37) = 13/2 * 86 = 13 * 43 = 559Total cost: 200 + 559 = 759, which is more than 710.Wait, that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe he kept some rides at 50 and decreased others.Wait, I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe the total number of rides is 15.Wait, let me think about the two expenditures separately.First, 345 rubles.If he took 7 rides, with 2 at 50 and 5 at 49, totaling 345.Then, for the second expenditure of 365 rubles, he took 8 rides, with 7 at 50 and 1 at 43, but that totals 393, which is too much.Wait, maybe he took 8 rides, with some decreasing.Wait, 365 rubles.If he took 8 rides, starting at 50, and decreasing some.So, the maximum cost is 8*50=400.He needs to spend 365, so he needs to decrease the total by 35 rubles.Since each decrease is 1 ruble per ride, he needs to decrease 35 rides by 1 ruble each.But he only took 8 rides, so he can't decrease 35 rides.Wait, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe he decreased some rides multiple times.But the problem says each following ride can cost the same or 1 ruble less.So, he can't decrease a ride by more than 1 ruble.Wait, maybe he decreased some rides by 1 ruble, but not all.So, the total decrease is 35 rubles over 8 rides.But 35 is more than 8, so he can't decrease each ride more than once.Wait, that's not possible.So, maybe he took more than 8 rides.Wait, let's try m=9.S_9 = 9/2 * (101 - 9) = 9/2 * 92 = 9*46 = 414Which is more than 365.So, difference is 414 - 365 = 49.So, he needs to decrease 49 rubles over 9 rides.But 49 > 9, so he can't decrease each ride more than once.Wait, this is getting too complicated.Maybe I need to think differently.Perhaps the total number of rides is 15.Wait, let me check.If Petya took 15 rides, the total cost would be 15/2 * (101 - 15) = 15/2 * 86 = 15*43 = 645.But he spent 710, which is 65 more.So, he must have taken some rides at higher fares.But the fares can't increase, only stay the same or decrease.So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe he took 16 rides.S_16 = 16/2 * (101 - 16) = 8*85 = 680Difference: 710 - 680 = 30So, he needs to increase the total by 30 rubles.But he can't increase fares, only keep them the same or decrease.Wait, so he must have kept some rides at 50 instead of decreasing.So, if he kept 'k' rides at 50, the total cost would be:k*50 + sum of the remaining (16 - k) rides decreasing from 50 - 1.Sum of decreasing rides: sum from i=1 to (16 - k) of (50 - i)Which is (16 - k)*50 - sum from i=1 to (16 - k) of i = (16 - k)*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2So, total cost:k*50 + (16 - k)*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 16*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2Set this equal to 710:16*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 710800 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 710So,(16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 800 - 710 = 90Multiply both sides by 2:(16 - k)(17 - k) = 180Let me expand the left side:(16 - k)(17 - k) = 272 - 33k + k^2 = 180So,k^2 - 33k + 272 - 180 = 0k^2 - 33k + 92 = 0Solve for k:k = [33 ± sqrt(33^2 - 4*1*92)] / 2Calculate discriminant:D = 1089 - 368 = 721Square root of 721 is approximately 26.85So,k = [33 ± 26.85] / 2k = (33 + 26.85)/2 ≈ 59.85/2 ≈ 29.925k = (33 - 26.85)/2 ≈ 6.15/2 ≈ 3.075Since k must be an integer between 0 and 16, let's check k=3 and k=4.For k=3:(16 - 3)(17 - 3) = 13*14 = 182 ≠ 180For k=4:(16 - 4)(17 - 4) = 12*13 = 156 ≠ 180Hmm, not matching.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation.Let me double-check.Total cost:k*50 + sum of decreasing rides = 710Sum of decreasing rides = (16 - k)*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2So,k*50 + (16 - k)*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 710Which simplifies to:16*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 710800 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 710So,(16 - k)(17 - k)/2 = 90Multiply by 2:(16 - k)(17 - k) = 180Which is correct.But when I solved for k, I got k ≈ 3.075 and 29.925, which are not integers.So, maybe there's no integer solution for k, meaning that Petya didn't take 16 rides.Wait, but earlier I thought n=17 gives S=714, which is close to 710.So, maybe Petya took 17 rides, but the total cost was 714, but he only spent 710, so he must have had some rides at 50 instead of decreasing.So, the difference is 714 - 710 = 4 rubles.So, he must have kept 4 rides at 50 instead of decreasing them.Wait, but how does that affect the total?If he kept 4 rides at 50, the total cost would be 4*50 + sum of the remaining 13 rides decreasing from 50 - 1.Sum of 13 rides decreasing from 49:Sum = 13/2 * (49 + (49 - 12)) = 13/2 * (49 + 37) = 13/2 * 86 = 13*43 = 559Total cost: 200 + 559 = 759, which is more than 710.Wait, that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe he kept 4 rides at 50 and decreased the rest.But that would increase the total cost, not decrease.Wait, I'm getting stuck.Maybe the answer is 15 rides.Wait, let me think about the two expenditures.First, 345 rubles.If he took 7 rides: 2 at 50, 5 at 49, totaling 345.Then, for the second expenditure of 365 rubles, he took 8 rides.But as we saw earlier, 8 rides would cost 372, which is more than 365.So, he must have decreased some rides.The difference is 372 - 365 = 7.So, he must have decreased 7 rides by 1 ruble each.But he only took 8 rides, so he can't decrease 7 rides.Wait, maybe he decreased 7 rides by 1 ruble each.But that would mean 7 rides at 49 and 1 ride at 50.Wait, but that would be 7*49 + 1*50 = 343 + 50 = 393, which is more than 365.Wait, that's not right.Wait, maybe he decreased some rides more than once.But the problem says each following ride can cost the same or 1 ruble less.So, he can't decrease a ride by more than 1 ruble.Wait, maybe he decreased some rides by 1 ruble, but not all.So, the total decrease is 7 rubles over 8 rides.But 7 < 8, so he can decrease 7 rides by 1 ruble each.So, 7 rides at 49 and 1 ride at 50.But that totals 7*49 + 1*50 = 343 + 50 = 393, which is still more than 365.Wait, I'm stuck.Maybe the answer is 15 rides.Wait, let me think differently.If Petya took 15 rides, the total cost would be 15/2 * (101 - 15) = 15*43 = 645.But he spent 710, which is 65 more.So, he must have taken some rides at higher fares.But he can't increase fares, only keep them the same or decrease.So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe he took 16 rides.S_16 = 680.He spent 710, so he needs 30 more.So, he must have kept some rides at 50 instead of decreasing.So, if he kept 'k' rides at 50, the total cost would be:k*50 + sum of the remaining (16 - k) rides decreasing from 50 - 1.Sum of decreasing rides: sum from i=1 to (16 - k) of (50 - i)Which is (16 - k)*50 - sum from i=1 to (16 - k) of i = (16 - k)*50 - (16 - k)(17 - k)/2So, total cost:k*50 + (16 -

Let me try that.Starting with ρ = -4 cos θ, I can multiply both sides by ρ to get:ρ * ρ = -4 * ρ cos θWhich simplifies to:ρ² = -4 ρ cos θNow, substituting the Cartesian equivalents:x² + y² = -4xWait, that's because ρ² is x² + y² and ρ cos θ is x. So, substituting those in, I get x² + y² = -4x.Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation. Maybe I can rearrange it to get it into a standard form. Let me move the -4x to the left side:x² + 4x + y² = 0Now, I think completing the square might help here to put it into the equation of a circle. Let's focus on the x terms:x² + 4xTo complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is 4, so half of that is 2, and then square it, getting 4. So, I add and subtract 4:(x² + 4x + 4) - 4 + y² = 0Which simplifies to:(x + 2)² + y² - 4 = 0Adding 4 to both sides:(x + 2)² + y² = 4Okay, so that looks like the equation of a circle with center at (-2, 0) and radius 2. Let me check the options given:A: x - 4 = 0B: x + 4 = 0C: (x + 2)² + y² = 4D: x² + (y + 2)² = 4So, option C matches my result. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.Starting with ρ = -4 cos θ. Multiplying both sides by ρ gives ρ² = -4 ρ cos θ. Substituting ρ² with x² + y² and ρ cos θ with x, I get x² + y² = -4x. Moving the -4x to the left side: x² + 4x + y² = 0. Completing the square for x: x² + 4x + 4 + y² = 4, which is (x + 2)² + y² = 4. Yep, that's correct.I think I did everything right. So, yeah, option C is the correct Cartesian equation."},{"question":"Bailey bought 8 dog treats and an additional some chew toys. She also got 10 more rawhide bones.

She bought 8 dog treats and 10 rawhide bones, which adds up to 18 items.Next, since Bailey split her charges equally across 4 credit cards and each charge included 5 items, the total number of items she purchased is 4 multiplied by 5, which equals 20 items.Finally, to find out how many chew toys Bailey bought, I subtract the number of known items (18) from the total number of items (20).

Prove that at most 10 lottery numbers can appear on more than 49 tickets.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: \\"Someone fills out 100 lottery tickets (differently). Prove that at most 10 lottery numbers can appear on more than 49 tickets.\\" Hmm, okay. Let me try to wrap my head around this.First, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 100 lottery tickets, each filled out differently. Each lottery ticket has a certain number of numbers on it, right? I think in most lotteries, each ticket has 5 numbers, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's different here. Well, the problem doesn't specify, so I might need to assume or figure that out.Wait, actually, the problem mentions \\"lottery numbers,\\" and in many lotteries, each ticket has 5 numbers. So, maybe each ticket has 5 numbers. That seems reasonable. So, if there are 100 tickets, each with 5 numbers, that's a total of 500 numbers filled out across all tickets. Okay, that makes sense.Now, the question is about how many of these lottery numbers can appear on more than 49 tickets. So, we need to find the maximum number of distinct lottery numbers that can each appear on more than 49 tickets. The claim is that this maximum is 10.Alright, so let's denote the number of times a particular lottery number appears across all tickets as its \\"count.\\" So, if a number appears on more than 49 tickets, its count is greater than 49.Given that there are 100 tickets, and each ticket has 5 numbers, the total number of number appearances is 500. So, the sum of all counts for all lottery numbers is 500.Now, we need to figure out the maximum number of lottery numbers that can have a count greater than 49. Let's denote this number as 'n.' So, we need to find the maximum possible 'n' such that each of these 'n' numbers appears more than 49 times.If each of these 'n' numbers appears at least 50 times (since more than 49 is 50 or more), then the total number of appearances for these 'n' numbers is at least 50n.But we know that the total number of appearances across all numbers is 500. So, 50n must be less than or equal to 500.So, 50n ≤ 500Dividing both sides by 50, we get:n ≤ 10Therefore, the maximum number of lottery numbers that can each appear on more than 49 tickets is 10.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.Is there a possibility that some numbers could appear more than 50 times, which might allow for more than 10 numbers to exceed 49 appearances? Let's see.Suppose one number appears 51 times. Then, the remaining total appearances would be 500 - 51 = 449.If we try to have as many numbers as possible exceed 49, we'd want to minimize the number of appearances for each of these numbers. So, ideally, each would appear exactly 50 times.So, with 449 remaining appearances, how many numbers can we have each appearing 50 times?449 divided by 50 is approximately 8.98. So, we can have 8 more numbers each appearing 50 times, which would account for 400 appearances, leaving us with 49 appearances.But 49 is not enough to have another number appear 50 times. So, in this case, we can have 1 number appearing 51 times and 8 numbers appearing 50 times, totaling 9 numbers exceeding 49 appearances.Wait, that's only 9, but earlier I concluded 10. Hmm, maybe my initial reasoning was a bit off.Alternatively, if we have 10 numbers each appearing exactly 50 times, that would account for 500 appearances, which is exactly the total number of appearances we have. So, in that case, all 10 numbers would each appear exactly 50 times, which is more than 49.But if we try to have 11 numbers each appearing more than 49 times, say 50 times each, that would require 11 * 50 = 550 appearances, which exceeds our total of 500. So, that's not possible.Therefore, the maximum number of lottery numbers that can each appear on more than 49 tickets is 10.Okay, that makes sense now. So, even if some numbers appear more than 50 times, the total number of numbers that can exceed 49 appearances is capped at 10 because 10 * 50 = 500, which is exactly the total number of appearances.So, in conclusion, at most 10 lottery numbers can appear on more than 49 tickets."},{"question":"Construct the function f(x) according to the following rule: For any real number x, the value of f(x) is the greater of 3-x and x^2-4x+3. Find the minimum value of the function f(x).","answer":"Okay, so I need to construct the function ( f(x) ) where for any real number ( x ), ( f(x) ) is the greater of ( 3 - x ) and ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ). Then, I have to find the minimum value of this function ( f(x) ). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I know that ( f(x) ) is defined as the maximum of two functions: ( 3 - x ) and ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ). So, for every ( x ), I need to compare these two functions and take the larger one as ( f(x) ). To visualize this, I might want to graph both functions to see where each one is larger.Let me start by analyzing each function separately.1. **Linear Function: ( 3 - x )**   - This is a straight line with a slope of -1 and a y-intercept at (0, 3).   - As ( x ) increases, the value of ( 3 - x ) decreases.   - So, it's a decreasing line starting from (0, 3) and going downward as ( x ) increases.2. **Quadratic Function: ( x^2 - 4x + 3 )**   - This is a parabola. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (1), it opens upwards.   - The vertex of this parabola will give me the minimum point because it opens upwards.   - To find the vertex, I can use the formula ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ) for a quadratic ( ax^2 + bx + c ).   - Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), so ( x = -frac{-4}{2*1} = frac{4}{2} = 2 ).   - Plugging ( x = 2 ) back into the quadratic: ( (2)^2 - 4*(2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1 ).   - So, the vertex is at (2, -1), which is the minimum point of this parabola.Now, I need to find where these two functions intersect because that will help me determine the intervals where each function is greater.**Finding Points of Intersection:**Set ( 3 - x = x^2 - 4x + 3 ) and solve for ( x ).[3 - x = x^2 - 4x + 3]Subtract ( 3 - x ) from both sides:[0 = x^2 - 4x + 3 - (3 - x)]Simplify:[0 = x^2 - 4x + 3 - 3 + x][0 = x^2 - 3x]Factor:[0 = x(x - 3)]So, ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 3 ).Therefore, the two functions intersect at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 3 ).**Determining Which Function is Greater in Different Intervals:**- **For ( x < 0 ):**  Let's pick a test point, say ( x = -1 ).  - ( 3 - (-1) = 4 )  - ( (-1)^2 - 4*(-1) + 3 = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 )  - So, ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ) is greater.- **For ( 0 < x < 3 ):**  Let's pick ( x = 1 ).  - ( 3 - 1 = 2 )  - ( (1)^2 - 4*(1) + 3 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0 )  - So, ( 3 - x ) is greater.- **For ( x > 3 ):**  Let's pick ( x = 4 ).  - ( 3 - 4 = -1 )  - ( (4)^2 - 4*(4) + 3 = 16 - 16 + 3 = 3 )  - So, ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ) is greater.So, summarizing:- ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ) when ( x leq 0 ) or ( x geq 3 )- ( f(x) = 3 - x ) when ( 0 leq x leq 3 )**Finding the Minimum Value of ( f(x) ):**Now, I need to find the minimum value of ( f(x) ). Since ( f(x) ) is the maximum of the two functions, its minimum will occur either at the minimum of the linear function within its interval or at the minimum of the quadratic function within its interval.1. **For ( f(x) = 3 - x ) in ( [0, 3] ):**   - This is a decreasing function, so its minimum occurs at ( x = 3 ).   - ( f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0 )2. **For ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ) in ( (-infty, 0] ) and ( [3, infty) ):**   - The minimum of the quadratic is at its vertex, which is at ( x = 2 ).   - But ( x = 2 ) is within the interval ( [0, 3] ), where ( f(x) = 3 - x ).   - Therefore, the minimum of the quadratic within its intervals ( (-infty, 0] ) and ( [3, infty) ) needs to be evaluated.   - **For ( x leq 0 ):**     - The quadratic is decreasing as ( x ) approaches 0 from the left.     - So, the minimum value in this interval is at ( x = 0 ).     - ( f(0) = 0^2 - 4*0 + 3 = 3 )   - **For ( x geq 3 ):**     - The quadratic is increasing as ( x ) moves away from 3 to the right.     - So, the minimum value in this interval is at ( x = 3 ).     - ( f(3) = 3^2 - 4*3 + 3 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0 )Wait, so both intervals for the quadratic have their minimum at the endpoints ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 3 ), both giving ( f(x) = 3 ) and ( f(x) = 0 ) respectively.But earlier, I thought the vertex at ( x = 2 ) gives ( f(x) = -1 ), but since ( x = 2 ) is in the interval where ( f(x) = 3 - x ), which is 1 at ( x = 2 ), the actual value of ( f(x) ) at ( x = 2 ) is 1, not -1.Therefore, the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 0, occurring at ( x = 3 ).But wait, let me double-check. At ( x = 3 ), both functions equal 0, so ( f(3) = 0 ). For ( x > 3 ), ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ), which increases beyond 0. For ( x < 0 ), ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ), which is greater than 3. In between, ( f(x) = 3 - x ), which decreases from 3 to 0 as ( x ) goes from 0 to 3.So, the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is indeed 0 at ( x = 3 ).Wait, but earlier I thought the quadratic's minimum is -1 at ( x = 2 ), but since ( f(x) ) at ( x = 2 ) is actually 1 (from ( 3 - x )), the quadratic's minimum doesn't affect ( f(x) ) because ( f(x) ) takes the maximum of the two. So, the overall minimum of ( f(x) ) is 0.But hold on, let me think again. If the quadratic's minimum is -1 at ( x = 2 ), but ( f(x) ) at ( x = 2 ) is 1, which is higher than -1. So, the quadratic's minimum is not achieved by ( f(x) ) because ( f(x) ) is taking the maximum. Therefore, the minimum of ( f(x) ) is not influenced by the quadratic's minimum but rather by the linear function's minimum.So, yes, the minimum of ( f(x) ) is 0 at ( x = 3 ).But wait, when ( x = 3 ), both functions equal 0, so that's correct.However, I'm a bit confused because the quadratic's minimum is lower, but since ( f(x) ) is the maximum, it can't go below the linear function's value in that interval. So, the overall minimum is indeed 0.But let me check another point. For example, at ( x = 2 ), ( f(x) = 1 ), which is higher than 0. At ( x = 1 ), ( f(x) = 2 ). So, yes, the minimum is at ( x = 3 ).Wait, but what about as ( x ) approaches infinity? The quadratic ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ) goes to infinity, so ( f(x) ) also goes to infinity. Similarly, as ( x ) approaches negative infinity, ( x^2 - 4x + 3 ) also goes to infinity. So, the function ( f(x) ) has a minimum somewhere.But according to my earlier analysis, the minimum is at ( x = 3 ), which is 0. But I'm still a bit unsure because the quadratic's minimum is -1, but it's not achieved by ( f(x) ).Let me try to plot these functions mentally. The linear function starts at (0, 3) and decreases to (3, 0). The quadratic starts at (0, 3), goes down to (2, -1), and then back up. So, between ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 3 ), the linear function is above the quadratic, so ( f(x) ) follows the linear function. Outside of that, it follows the quadratic.Therefore, the minimum of ( f(x) ) is at ( x = 3 ), where both functions meet at 0.But wait, if I consider the quadratic's minimum at ( x = 2 ), which is -1, but since ( f(x) ) is the maximum, at ( x = 2 ), ( f(x) ) is 1, which is higher than -1. So, the quadratic's minimum doesn't influence ( f(x) )'s minimum.Therefore, the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 0 at ( x = 3 ).But hold on, let me check the value of ( f(x) ) just after ( x = 3 ). For ( x > 3 ), ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ). Let's take ( x = 4 ): ( f(4) = 16 - 16 + 3 = 3 ). So, it's increasing after ( x = 3 ). Similarly, for ( x = 3.5 ): ( f(3.5) = 12.25 - 14 + 3 = 1.25 ). So, it's increasing from 0 upwards as ( x ) increases beyond 3.Similarly, for ( x < 0 ), ( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 ). Let's take ( x = -1 ): ( f(-1) = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 ). So, it's increasing as ( x ) becomes more negative.Therefore, the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is indeed 0 at ( x = 3 ).But wait, I'm still a bit confused because the quadratic's minimum is -1, but since ( f(x) ) is the maximum, it can't go below the linear function's value in that interval. So, the overall minimum is 0.Yes, I think that's correct. The minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 0 at ( x = 3 ).But just to be thorough, let me check the behavior around ( x = 3 ). For ( x ) slightly less than 3, say ( x = 2.9 ), ( f(x) = 3 - 2.9 = 0.1 ). For ( x = 3 ), ( f(x) = 0 ). For ( x = 3.1 ), ( f(x) = (3.1)^2 - 4*(3.1) + 3 = 9.61 - 12.4 + 3 = 0.21 ). So, it's increasing on both sides of ( x = 3 ), confirming that ( x = 3 ) is indeed the minimum.Therefore, the minimum value of ( f(x) ) is 0."},{"question":"After Olivia visited a supermarket there were 29 dollars left.

The belt touches each pulley at exactly one point and the straight-line distance between these two points of contact is 26 inches. What is the distance between the centers of the two pulleys?A) 28B) 2sqrt{196}C) 2sqrt{194}D) 30","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two circular pulleys with different radii, and there's a belt connecting them without crossing. The belt touches each pulley at exactly one point, and the straight-line distance between these two points is 26 inches. I need to find the distance between the centers of the two pulleys.First, let me visualize the setup. There are two circles, one with a radius of 15 inches and the other with a radius of 5 inches. The belt is taut and straight, meaning it's just touching each pulley at one point each. The distance between these two contact points is 26 inches.I remember that when dealing with pulleys and belts, the belt is tangent to both circles. So, the line connecting the two points where the belt touches the pulleys is a common external tangent to both circles. The distance between the centers of the pulleys can be found using the properties of tangents and right triangles.Let me denote the centers of the two pulleys as points A and B. The radii are 15 inches and 5 inches, so the distance between the centers, AB, is what I need to find. The points where the belt touches the pulleys are points C and D, and the distance CD is 26 inches.Since the belt is a common external tangent, the line CD is tangent to both circles. I know that the radius to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. So, AC is perpendicular to CD, and BD is also perpendicular to CD. This means that AC and BD are both perpendicular to the same line, so AC and BD must be parallel to each other.Now, if I draw lines AC and BD, both perpendicular to CD, and since AC is 15 inches and BD is 5 inches, the difference in radii is 15 - 5 = 10 inches. This difference in radii will form one leg of a right triangle, where the other leg is the distance CD, which is 26 inches. The hypotenuse of this right triangle will be the distance between the centers AB.Wait, let me make sure I'm setting this up correctly. If I imagine shifting one pulley up or down relative to the other, the line connecting their centers would form a right triangle with the difference in radii and the length of the tangent. So, yes, the distance between the centers AB can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.So, let's denote the difference in radii as h = 15 - 5 = 10 inches. The length of the tangent CD is 26 inches. Then, the distance AB is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs h and CD.But wait, actually, I think I might have mixed up the legs. The length of the external tangent between two circles can be calculated using the formula:Length of external tangent = sqrt(d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2)where d is the distance between the centers, and r1 and r2 are the radii of the two circles.In this case, we know the length of the external tangent is 26 inches, and the radii are 15 and 5 inches. So, plugging into the formula:26 = sqrt(d^2 - (15 - 5)^2)26 = sqrt(d^2 - 10^2)26 = sqrt(d^2 - 100)Now, squaring both sides:26^2 = d^2 - 100676 = d^2 - 100d^2 = 676 + 100d^2 = 776d = sqrt(776)Simplify sqrt(776). Let's see, 776 divided by 4 is 194, so sqrt(776) = sqrt(4*194) = 2*sqrt(194).So, the distance between the centers is 2*sqrt(194) inches.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I used the formula for the length of the external tangent, plugged in the known values, solved for d, and simplified the square root. Everything seems to add up. I think this is the correct answer."},{"question":"If a cube has a volume of 125 cubic decimeters, what is the surface area of one side in square centimeters?","answer":"First, I need to determine the length of one side of the cube.

The answer choices are A: ( frac{1}{6} ), B: ( frac{sqrt{3}}{6} ), C: ( frac{1}{3} ), and D: ( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I notice that there are two equations and three variables, so maybe I can eliminate one variable to make it easier. Let me see, if I can express ( c ) from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation, that might help.From the first equation, ( a + b + c = 4 ), I can solve for ( c ):[ c = 4 - a - b ]Now, substitute this expression for ( c ) into the second equation:[ 3a + 2b - c = 0 ][ 3a + 2b - (4 - a - b) = 0 ]Let me simplify this:[ 3a + 2b - 4 + a + b = 0 ]Combine like terms:[ (3a + a) + (2b + b) - 4 = 0 ][ 4a + 3b - 4 = 0 ]So, ( 4a + 3b = 4 ). Okay, that's a simpler equation with just two variables. Now, I need to find the maximum value of ( ab ). Hmm, how can I approach this? Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and then find the maximum of the product. Let's try expressing ( a ) in terms of ( b ) from the equation ( 4a + 3b = 4 ).Solving for ( a ):[ 4a = 4 - 3b ][ a = frac{4 - 3b}{4} ][ a = 1 - frac{3}{4}b ]Now, substitute this expression for ( a ) into ( ab ):[ ab = left(1 - frac{3}{4}bright) times b ][ ab = b - frac{3}{4}b^2 ]So, ( ab = -frac{3}{4}b^2 + b ). This is a quadratic equation in terms of ( b ). Since the coefficient of ( b^2 ) is negative, the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex will give the maximum value.The general form of a quadratic equation is ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ), and the vertex occurs at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). In this case, ( a = -frac{3}{4} ) and ( b = 1 ). So, the value of ( b ) at the vertex is:[ b = -frac{1}{2 times -frac{3}{4}} ][ b = -frac{1}{-frac{3}{2}} ][ b = frac{2}{3} ]Okay, so when ( b = frac{2}{3} ), the product ( ab ) is maximized. Now, let's find the corresponding ( a ) value using the expression we found earlier:[ a = 1 - frac{3}{4}b ][ a = 1 - frac{3}{4} times frac{2}{3} ]Simplify:[ a = 1 - frac{6}{12} ][ a = 1 - frac{1}{2} ][ a = frac{1}{2} ]So, when ( a = frac{1}{2} ) and ( b = frac{2}{3} ), the product ( ab ) should be at its maximum. Let's calculate ( ab ):[ ab = frac{1}{2} times frac{2}{3} ][ ab = frac{1}{3} ]Hmm, that's one of the answer choices. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I eliminated ( c ) correctly by substituting ( c = 4 - a - b ) into the second equation.2. Simplified the equation to ( 4a + 3b = 4 ).3. Expressed ( a ) in terms of ( b ): ( a = 1 - frac{3}{4}b ).4. Substituted into ( ab ) to get ( ab = -frac{3}{4}b^2 + b ).5. Found the vertex of the quadratic, which is at ( b = frac{2}{3} ).6. Calculated ( a = frac{1}{2} ) and then ( ab = frac{1}{3} ).Everything seems to check out. So, the maximum value of ( ab ) is ( frac{1}{3} ), which is option C.Wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can try another method to confirm. Let's use the method of Lagrange multipliers or maybe AM-GM inequality.Wait, AM-GM might be simpler here. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. But in this case, we have ( 4a + 3b = 4 ). Maybe I can apply AM-GM to ( 4a ) and ( 3b ).Let me consider ( 4a ) and ( 3b ) as two terms. Then, the arithmetic mean is:[ frac{4a + 3b}{2} geq sqrt{4a times 3b} ]We know that ( 4a + 3b = 4 ), so:[ frac{4}{2} geq sqrt{12ab} ][ 2 geq sqrt{12ab} ]Square both sides:[ 4 geq 12ab ][ ab leq frac{4}{12} ][ ab leq frac{1}{3} ]So, that confirms it again. The maximum value of ( ab ) is ( frac{1}{3} ). Therefore, the answer should be C.I think I've approached this from two different angles now, both leading to the same conclusion. I feel confident that ( frac{1}{3} ) is indeed the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"A high school grade 10 wants to reward students with outstanding results in their first monthly exam.

So, every 40th prize will be selected.One of the selected prizes is number 6. Using systematic sampling, the next prizes will be 6 plus multiples of 40. Calculating the next four prizes:- 6 + 40 = 46- 46 + 40 = 86- 86 + 40 = 126- 126 + 40 = 166Therefore, the numbers of the other four prizes are 46, 86, 126, and 166."},{"question":"Keiko walks once around a track at exactly the same constant speed every day. The sides of the track are straight, and the ends are semicircles.

Let me try to understand it step by step. The track has straight sides and semicircular ends, and it's 8 meters wide. Keiko walks around the track at a constant speed every day. The key information is that it takes her 48 seconds longer to walk around the outside edge compared to the inside edge. I need to find her speed in meters per second.First, I should visualize the track. It's like a rectangle with semicircular ends, right? So, the straight parts are the sides, and the curved parts are the semicircles. The width of the track is 8 meters, which means the distance between the inner edge and the outer edge is 8 meters.Since the ends are semicircles, the inner edge has a smaller radius, and the outer edge has a larger radius. Let me denote the radius of the inner semicircle as ( r ). Then, the radius of the outer semicircle would be ( r + 8 ) meters because the track is 8 meters wide.Now, I need to find the perimeters of both the inner and outer edges because the time difference is related to the difference in their lengths. Keiko walks around each edge at the same constant speed, so the time difference is due to the difference in the distances she covers.Let's denote Keiko's speed as ( s ) meters per second. The time it takes to walk a certain distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed. So, the time to walk around the inner edge is ( frac{L_{text{inner}}}{s} ) and the time to walk around the outer edge is ( frac{L_{text{outer}}}{s} ). The problem states that the outer edge takes 48 seconds longer, so:[frac{L_{text{outer}}}{s} = frac{L_{text{inner}}}{s} + 48]I need to find ( L_{text{inner}} ) and ( L_{text{outer}} ).Starting with the inner edge: it has two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The straight sides are each of length ( a ), but I don't know what ( a ) is. However, since the track is 8 meters wide, the difference in the perimeters will only depend on the difference in the circumferences of the semicircles. The straight parts will cancel out when I subtract the inner perimeter from the outer perimeter.Wait, is that right? Let me think. The inner perimeter is ( 2a + 2 times text{circumference of inner semicircle} ). Similarly, the outer perimeter is ( 2a + 2 times text{circumference of outer semicircle} ). So, when I subtract the inner perimeter from the outer perimeter, the ( 2a ) terms will cancel out, leaving only the difference in the circumferences.Yes, that makes sense. So, the difference in the lengths is just the difference in the circumferences of the two semicircles multiplied by 2 because there are two ends.The circumference of a full circle is ( 2pi r ), so the circumference of a semicircle is ( pi r ). Therefore, the total circumference for both semicircles on the inner edge is ( 2 times pi r = 2pi r ). Similarly, for the outer edge, it's ( 2 times pi (r + 8) = 2pi (r + 8) ).So, the difference in the perimeters is:[L_{text{outer}} - L_{text{inner}} = 2pi (r + 8) - 2pi r = 2pi r + 16pi - 2pi r = 16pi]So, the outer perimeter is longer by ( 16pi ) meters than the inner perimeter.Now, going back to the time difference equation:[frac{L_{text{outer}}}{s} = frac{L_{text{inner}}}{s} + 48]Subtracting ( frac{L_{text{inner}}}{s} ) from both sides:[frac{L_{text{outer}} - L_{text{inner}}}{s} = 48]We already found that ( L_{text{outer}} - L_{text{inner}} = 16pi ), so:[frac{16pi}{s} = 48]Now, solving for ( s ):[s = frac{16pi}{48} = frac{pi}{3}]So, Keiko's speed is ( frac{pi}{3} ) meters per second.Wait, let me double-check my steps. I assumed that the difference in perimeters is only due to the semicircular ends, which seems correct because the straight parts are the same for both inner and outer edges. The calculation for the difference in circumference also seems right: ( 2pi (r + 8) - 2pi r = 16pi ). Then, using the time difference, I set up the equation correctly and solved for ( s ). It all seems consistent.I think I'm confident with this answer. It's one of the options provided, specifically option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"If Teena is driving at a certain speed and is currently 7.5 miles behind Coe, who is driving at 40 miles per hour in the same direction, then Teena will be 15 miles ahead of Coe in 90 minutes. What is Teena's speed?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Teena is driving at a certain speed and is currently 7.5 miles behind Coe, who is driving at 40 miles per hour in the same direction. Then, Teena will be 15 miles ahead of Coe in 90 minutes. I need to find Teena's speed. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let's visualize the situation. Coe is ahead, driving at 40 mph, and Teena is behind, 7.5 miles back. Teena wants to not only catch up but also get 15 miles ahead of Coe in 90 minutes. So, in 90 minutes, Teena needs to cover the 7.5 miles to catch up and then an additional 15 miles to get ahead. That means, relative to Coe, Teena needs to make up a total of 7.5 + 15 = 22.5 miles in 90 minutes.Wait, but Coe is also moving during this time. So, Coe isn't just staying in one place; he's moving forward at 40 mph. That means Teena isn't just trying to cover 22.5 miles relative to a stationary point, but relative to Coe, who is also moving. So, I need to factor in how far Coe travels in those 90 minutes as well.Okay, let's convert 90 minutes into hours because speed is in miles per hour. 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. So, in 1.5 hours, Coe will have traveled:Distance = Speed × TimeDistance = 40 mph × 1.5 hours = 60 milesSo, Coe will be 60 miles ahead of his current position in 1.5 hours. But Teena needs to not only cover the initial 7.5 miles to catch up but also get 15 miles ahead of Coe. So, relative to Coe's new position, Teena needs to cover:7.5 miles (to catch up) + 15 miles (to get ahead) = 22.5 milesBut wait, Coe is moving forward 60 miles in that time, so Teena's total distance to cover is not just 22.5 miles, but also the distance Coe covers. So, Teena needs to cover:Coe's distance + the distance to get ahead60 miles + 15 miles = 75 milesBut Teena starts 7.5 miles behind Coe, so she needs to cover the 7.5 miles to catch up plus the 75 miles to get ahead. So, total distance Teena needs to cover is:7.5 miles + 75 miles = 82.5 milesNow, Teena covers 82.5 miles in 1.5 hours. To find her speed, we use the formula:Speed = Distance / TimeSpeed = 82.5 miles / 1.5 hoursLet me calculate that. 82.5 divided by 1.5. Well, 1.5 times 55 is 82.5, so Teena's speed is 55 mph.Wait, let me double-check that. If Teena is driving at 55 mph for 1.5 hours, she would cover:55 mph × 1.5 hours = 82.5 milesAnd Coe, driving at 40 mph for 1.5 hours, covers:40 mph × 1.5 hours = 60 milesSo, Teena starts 7.5 miles behind, so her starting point is 7.5 miles back from Coe. In 1.5 hours, she covers 82.5 miles, while Coe covers 60 miles. So, the distance between them after 1.5 hours is:Teena's distance - Coe's distance = 82.5 - 60 = 22.5 milesBut Teena needs to be 15 miles ahead, not 22.5 miles. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake somewhere?Let me go back. Maybe I overcomplicated it. Let's think differently. The relative speed between Teena and Coe is what matters here. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is Teena's speed minus Coe's speed.Let’s denote Teena's speed as T mph. So, the relative speed is (T - 40) mph.In 1.5 hours, the distance Teena needs to cover relative to Coe is 7.5 miles to catch up plus 15 miles to get ahead, which is 22.5 miles.So, using the formula:Relative Distance = Relative Speed × Time22.5 miles = (T - 40) mph × 1.5 hoursNow, solve for T:(T - 40) = 22.5 / 1.5(T - 40) = 15T = 15 + 40T = 55 mphOkay, that matches my initial calculation. So, Teena's speed is 55 mph. Maybe my earlier confusion was because I was thinking about the absolute distances instead of the relative distance needed to overtake and get ahead.Let me confirm again. If Teena drives at 55 mph for 1.5 hours, she covers 82.5 miles. Coe drives at 40 mph for 1.5 hours, covering 60 miles. The difference is 22.5 miles, which means Teena is 22.5 miles ahead of Coe. But the problem says she needs to be only 15 miles ahead. Wait, that's still a discrepancy.Hold on, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. It says Teena is currently 7.5 miles behind Coe, and in 90 minutes, she will be 15 miles ahead. So, the total distance she needs to cover relative to Coe is 7.5 + 15 = 22.5 miles. That makes sense. So, the relative speed calculation is correct, leading to Teena's speed being 55 mph.But why does the absolute distance calculation give a different impression? Because in absolute terms, Teena covers 82.5 miles, and Coe covers 60 miles, so the difference is indeed 22.5 miles, which is the required 15 miles ahead plus the initial 7.5 miles deficit. So, it all checks out.I think I was just tripped up by looking at the absolute distances instead of focusing on the relative distance needed. So, yes, Teena's speed is 55 mph."},{"question":"Given that a < -3, determine whether the statement \\"Function f(x) = ax + 3 has a zero point x_0 in the interval [-1, 2]\\" is a (blank).A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Necessary and sufficient conditionD: Neither necessary nor sufficient condition","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that ( a < -3 ), I need to determine whether the statement \\"Function ( f(x) = ax + 3 ) has a zero point ( x_0 ) in the interval ([-1, 2])\\" is a sufficient condition, necessary condition, both, or neither. The options are A, B, C, D, corresponding to sufficient but not necessary, necessary but not sufficient, necessary and sufficient, and neither necessary nor sufficient.Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what it means for a function to have a zero point in a given interval. A zero point ( x_0 ) is where the function crosses the x-axis, meaning ( f(x_0) = 0 ).Given ( f(x) = ax + 3 ), I can set this equal to zero and solve for ( x ) to find the zero point. So, ( ax + 3 = 0 ) implies ( x = -frac{3}{a} ). That gives me the x-coordinate where the function crosses zero.Now, the question is whether this zero point ( x_0 = -frac{3}{a} ) lies within the interval ([-1, 2]). So, I need to check if ( -1 leq -frac{3}{a} leq 2 ).But wait, I also know that ( a < -3 ). So, ( a ) is a negative number less than -3. Let's think about what that means for ( -frac{3}{a} ). Since ( a ) is negative, ( -frac{3}{a} ) will be positive because a negative divided by a negative is positive. So, ( x_0 ) is positive.But is this positive number within the interval ([-1, 2])? Well, since it's positive, it's automatically greater than -1, so the lower bound is satisfied. But we need to check if it's less than or equal to 2.So, ( -frac{3}{a} leq 2 ). Let's solve this inequality for ( a ). Multiply both sides by ( a ), but since ( a ) is negative, the inequality sign will flip. So, ( -3 geq 2a ). Dividing both sides by 2, we get ( -frac{3}{2} geq a ). But we know that ( a < -3 ), which is more restrictive than ( a leq -frac{3}{2} ). So, actually, ( a < -3 ) implies that ( -frac{3}{a} < 1 ) because ( a ) is less than -3, making ( -frac{3}{a} ) less than 1.Wait, let me double-check that. If ( a = -4 ), then ( x_0 = -frac{3}{-4} = frac{3}{4} ), which is 0.75, definitely less than 2. If ( a = -6 ), ( x_0 = 0.5 ). So, as ( a ) becomes more negative, ( x_0 ) approaches 0. So, ( x_0 ) is always between 0 and 1 when ( a < -3 ).Therefore, ( x_0 ) is always in the interval ([0, 1]), which is within ([-1, 2]). So, does that mean that ( a < -3 ) is a sufficient condition for ( f(x) ) to have a zero in ([-1, 2])?But hold on, is it also necessary? Could there be values of ( a ) where ( a geq -3 ) but still ( f(x) ) has a zero in ([-1, 2])? Let's see.Suppose ( a = -2 ), which is greater than -3. Then ( x_0 = -frac{3}{-2} = 1.5 ), which is still within ([-1, 2]). So, even though ( a ) is not less than -3, the function still has a zero in the interval. Therefore, ( a < -3 ) is not a necessary condition because there are cases where ( a ) is greater than -3 and the function still has a zero in the interval.So, putting it all together, ( a < -3 ) is a sufficient condition because if ( a < -3 ), then ( f(x) ) will definitely have a zero in ([-1, 2]). However, it's not a necessary condition because there are values of ( a ) greater than -3 where the function still has a zero in that interval.Therefore, the correct answer should be A: Sufficient but not necessary condition."},{"question":"Given a=frac{1}{1+e^{2}}, b=frac{1}{e}, c=lnfrac{1+e^{2}}{e^{2}}, then ()A: a gt b gt cB: b gt c gt aC: c gt b gt aD: b gt a gt c","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here with three expressions: a, b, and c. I need to figure out their order from greatest to least and choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.Given:- ( a = frac{1}{1 + e^2} )- ( b = frac{1}{e} )- ( c = lnleft(frac{1 + e^2}{e^2}right) )And the options are:A: ( a > b > c )B: ( b > c > a )C: ( c > b > a )D: ( b > a > c )Okay, so I need to compare these three values: a, b, and c. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that ( e ) is approximately 2.718, so ( e^2 ) is about 7.389. That might help me approximate the values.Starting with ( a = frac{1}{1 + e^2} ). Plugging in the approximate value of ( e^2 ), that would be ( frac{1}{1 + 7.389} = frac{1}{8.389} ). Calculating that, it's roughly 0.119.Next, ( b = frac{1}{e} ). Since ( e ) is approximately 2.718, ( frac{1}{e} ) is about 0.368.Now, ( c = lnleft(frac{1 + e^2}{e^2}right) ). Let's simplify that expression inside the logarithm first. ( frac{1 + e^2}{e^2} = frac{1}{e^2} + 1 ). So, ( c = lnleft(1 + frac{1}{e^2}right) ).Calculating ( frac{1}{e^2} ) gives approximately ( frac{1}{7.389} approx 0.135 ). So, ( 1 + 0.135 = 1.135 ). Now, taking the natural logarithm of 1.135. I remember that ( ln(1) = 0 ) and ( ln(e) = 1 ), so ( ln(1.135) ) should be a small positive number. Maybe around 0.127?So, summarizing my approximate calculations:- ( a approx 0.119 )- ( b approx 0.368 )- ( c approx 0.127 )Comparing these, ( b ) is the largest, followed by ( c ), and then ( a ). So, the order is ( b > c > a ), which corresponds to option B.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For ( a ):( 1 + e^2 approx 1 + 7.389 = 8.389 )( frac{1}{8.389} approx 0.119 ) – that seems right.For ( b ):( frac{1}{e} approx 0.368 ) – yes, that's correct.For ( c ):( frac{1 + e^2}{e^2} = 1 + frac{1}{e^2} approx 1 + 0.135 = 1.135 )( ln(1.135) approx 0.127 ) – I think that's accurate.So, ( b approx 0.368 ), ( c approx 0.127 ), and ( a approx 0.119 ). Therefore, ( b > c > a ), which is option B.I think that makes sense because ( b ) is ( frac{1}{e} ), which is a fairly large number, while ( a ) and ( c ) are both less than 0.15. Between ( a ) and ( c ), ( c ) is slightly larger because the natural logarithm of a number slightly greater than 1 is a small positive number, but ( a ) is just a fraction of 1 over something larger.So, yeah, I feel confident that option B is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Find the probability that the groups will be able to contact each other.

Therefore, the probability that no tourist has the phone number of anyone from the other group is (1-p)^{42}.Hence, the desired probability is 1 - (1-p)^{42}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem here about two groups of tourists trying to contact each other. Let me try to understand it step by step.First, there are two groups: one with 6 tourists and another with 7 tourists. The problem is about finding the probability that these two groups can contact each other. It mentions considering pairs where the first tourist is from the first group and the second is from the second group. It says there are 6 times 7, which is 42 such pairs. Then, it states that the probability that no tourist has the phone number of anyone from the other group is (1-p)^42. Therefore, the desired probability is 1 minus that, which is 1 - (1-p)^42.Hmm, okay. So, let me break this down. We have two groups, Group A with 6 people and Group B with 7 people. Each person in Group A could potentially have the phone number of someone in Group B, and vice versa. But the problem seems to focus on the probability that at least one person from Group A has the phone number of someone in Group B, or vice versa.The problem mentions pairs of tourists where the first is from Group A and the second is from Group B. There are 6 times 7, which is 42 such pairs. So, each of these pairs represents a potential connection between the two groups.Now, the probability that no tourist has the phone number of anyone from the other group is given as (1-p)^42. I think this is because for each of these 42 pairs, the probability that they cannot contact each other is (1-p). If we assume that these events are independent, then the probability that none of the pairs can contact each other is (1-p) raised to the power of 42.Therefore, the probability that at least one pair can contact each other is the complement of the probability that no pairs can contact each other. That would be 1 minus the probability that no pairs can contact each other, which is 1 - (1-p)^42.Wait, but does this make sense? Let me think about it again. If p is the probability that a specific pair can contact each other, then (1-p) is the probability that they cannot. Since there are 42 independent pairs, the probability that none of them can contact each other is (1-p)^42. So, the probability that at least one can contact is indeed 1 - (1-p)^42.But I'm a bit confused about the independence assumption. Are these events truly independent? In reality, if one pair can contact each other, does that affect the probability of another pair being able to contact? Maybe not, if we assume that the phone numbers are independent. So, perhaps the independence assumption holds here.Also, the problem seems to consider only one direction: from Group A to Group B. But what about from Group B to Group A? Does that matter? I think in this case, since we're considering pairs where the first is from Group A and the second is from Group B, it's only one direction. But if we wanted to consider both directions, we might have to adjust the calculation.But according to the problem statement, it's only considering pairs where the first is from Group A and the second is from Group B, so maybe we don't need to worry about the reverse direction. Or perhaps the problem is symmetric, so it doesn't matter.Another thing I'm thinking about is whether this is a binomial probability scenario. Each pair has a success probability p of being able to contact, and we're looking for the probability of at least one success out of 42 trials. That would indeed be 1 - (1-p)^42, which matches what the problem states.So, to summarize, the problem is asking for the probability that at least one tourist from Group A can contact at least one tourist from Group B. By considering all possible pairs between the two groups, which are 42 in total, and assuming that each pair has an independent probability p of being able to contact, the probability that none can contact is (1-p)^42. Therefore, the desired probability is 1 minus that, which is 1 - (1-p)^42.I think I understand it now. It's essentially using the complement rule in probability to find the probability of at least one success in multiple independent trials."},{"question":"An uneducated retailer marks all his goods at 65% above the cost price and thinking that he will still make a certain profit, offers a discount of 25% on the marked price.

Let's assume the cost price (CP) is 100 for simplicity.Next, the retailer marks up the goods by 65%.

Let's take them one at a time.**Problem 1:** Calculate (3sqrt{3} - sqrt{8} + sqrt{2} - sqrt{27}).Okay, so this is a combination of square roots with different coefficients. I remember that when dealing with square roots, it's helpful to simplify them as much as possible, especially if they have common factors or can be expressed in terms of simpler square roots. Let me see if I can simplify each term individually.Starting with (3sqrt{3}), that seems straightforward. I don't think it can be simplified further because 3 is a prime number and doesn't have any square factors other than 1.Next up is (-sqrt{8}). Hmm, 8 can be broken down into 4 and 2, right? And since 4 is a perfect square, I can take its square root out of the radical. So, (sqrt{8} = sqrt{4 times 2} = sqrt{4} times sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{2}). Therefore, (-sqrt{8} = -2sqrt{2}).Then we have (+sqrt{2}). That's already simplified, so I'll leave it as is.Lastly, (-sqrt{27}). Similar to (sqrt{8}), 27 can be broken down into 9 and 3. Since 9 is a perfect square, (sqrt{27} = sqrt{9 times 3} = sqrt{9} times sqrt{3} = 3sqrt{3}). So, (-sqrt{27} = -3sqrt{3}).Now, substituting these simplified forms back into the original expression:(3sqrt{3} - 2sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} - 3sqrt{3}).Looking at this, I can see that some terms might cancel out or combine. Let's group like terms together:- The (3sqrt{3}) and (-3sqrt{3}) terms.- The (-2sqrt{2}) and (+sqrt{2}) terms.Calculating the first group: (3sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3} = 0).Calculating the second group: (-2sqrt{2} + sqrt{2} = (-2 + 1)sqrt{2} = -sqrt{2}).So, combining these results, the entire expression simplifies to (-sqrt{2}).Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Simplified (sqrt{8}) to (2sqrt{2}) correctly.2. Simplified (sqrt{27}) to (3sqrt{3}) correctly.3.

I need to divide each term in the numerator by the denominator. Let's break it down step by step.First, rewrite the expression for clarity:[frac{4sqrt{6} - 6sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}}]I can separate this into two separate fractions:[frac{4sqrt{6}}{2sqrt{3}} - frac{6sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}}]Simplify each fraction individually.Starting with the first term: (frac{4sqrt{6}}{2sqrt{3}}).Simplify the coefficients first: (4 div 2 = 2).Now, deal with the radicals: (sqrt{6} div sqrt{3}). I recall that (sqrt{a} div sqrt{b} = sqrt{frac{a}{b}}), so:[sqrt{6} div sqrt{3} = sqrt{frac{6}{3}} = sqrt{2}]Putting it all together: (2 times sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{2}).Now, moving on to the second term: (frac{6sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}}).Again, simplify the coefficients first: (6 div 2 = 3).Now, deal with the radicals: (sqrt{3} div sqrt{3} = 1), since any non-zero number divided by itself is 1.Putting it all together: (3 times 1 = 3).So, now, substituting back into the expression:[2sqrt{2} - 3]Let me verify my steps to ensure accuracy.1. Separated the original expression into two fractions correctly.2. Simplified the coefficients and radicals separately.3. Applied the property (sqrt{a} div sqrt{b} = sqrt{frac{a}{b}}) correctly.4. Simplified each term and combined them.Everything seems correct. Therefore, the answer to Problem 2 is (2sqrt{2} - 3).In summary:1. (3sqrt{3} - sqrt{8} + sqrt{2} - sqrt{27} = -sqrt{2})2. ((4sqrt{6} - 6sqrt{3}) div 2sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{2} - 3)I think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work to ensure there are no errors.

They are evenly divided into 10 groups in ascending order of their numbers, with group numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 10. A systematic sampling method is used to draw a sample of size 10. It is stipulated that if the number drawn in the first group is m, then the number drawn in the k^{th} group must have a units digit same as that of m + k. If m = 8, then the number drawn from the eighth group is __________.","answer":"Alright, let's try to figure out this systematic sampling problem. So, we have a population of 100 individuals numbered from 0 to 99. They're divided into 10 groups, each containing 10 individuals. The groups are numbered from 1 to 10, and within each group, the individuals are in ascending order based on their numbers.The problem says that we're using a systematic sampling method to draw a sample of size 10. Systematic sampling usually involves selecting every k-th individual from a list, but here it seems a bit different because it's divided into groups. The rule given is that if the number drawn in the first group is m, then the number drawn in the k-th group must have a units digit same as that of m + k.Okay, so m is given as 8. That means in the first group, we're selecting the number 8. Now, for each subsequent group, the number we pick should have the same units digit as m + k, where k is the group number.Let me break this down. For the first group (k=1), the number is m=8. For the second group (k=2), the number should have the same units digit as 8 + 2, which is 10. The units digit of 10 is 0, so in the second group, we pick the number ending with 0. Since each group has 10 individuals, the second group would be numbers 10 to 19, so the number ending with 0 is 10.Moving on to the third group (k=3), the units digit should be the same as 8 + 3 = 11. The units digit is 1, so in the third group (numbers 20 to 29), we pick 21.Continuing this pattern, for the fourth group (k=4), 8 + 4 = 12, units digit 2. So, in the fourth group (30 to 39), we pick 32.Fifth group (k=5), 8 + 5 = 13, units digit 3. So, in the fifth group (40 to 49), we pick 43.Sixth group (k=6), 8 + 6 = 14, units digit 4. So, in the sixth group (50 to 59), we pick 54.Seventh group (k=7), 8 + 7 = 15, units digit 5. So, in the seventh group (60 to 69), we pick 65.Now, we need to find the number drawn from the eighth group (k=8). Let's calculate 8 + 8 = 16. The units digit is 6. So, in the eighth group, which should be numbers 70 to 79, we need to pick the number ending with 6. That would be 76.Wait, let me double-check that. The eighth group is numbers 70 to 79. Adding 6 to 70 gives 76, which is within the range. So, yes, 76 is the correct number.Just to make sure, let's see the pattern:1st group: 82nd group: 103rd group: 214th group: 325th group: 436th group: 547th group: 658th group: 769th group: 8710th group: 98Yes, that seems consistent. Each time, we're adding 10 to the previous number and then adjusting the units digit according to m + k.So, the number drawn from the eighth group is 76."},{"question":"Among the categorical variables of smoking and lung disease, the correct statement is (   )A: If the observed value of K^2 is k=6.635, we are 99% confident that smoking is related to lung disease, then among 100 smokers, there must be 99 people with lung disease;B: From the independence test, we know that we are 99% confident that smoking is related to lung disease, we say that if someone smokes, then there is a 99% chance they have lung disease;C: If it is concluded from the statistic that there is a 95% confidence that smoking is related to lung disease, it means there is a 5% chance of making a wrong judgment;D: All of the above statements are incorrect.","answer":"Okay, so I have this question about categorical variables, specifically smoking and lung disease. It's asking which statement is correct among A, B, C, or D. Let me try to understand each option one by one.Starting with option A: It says that if the observed value of K² is k=6.635, we are 99% confident that smoking is related to lung disease, and then among 100 smokers, there must be 99 people with lung disease. Hmm, wait a minute. I know that K² is likely referring to the chi-squared statistic, which is used in hypothesis testing to determine if there's a significant association between two categorical variables. So, if the chi-squared value is 6.635, and we're 99% confident, that means there's a 1% chance that the association is due to random chance. But does that mean that 99 out of 100 smokers have lung disease? That doesn't sound right. Confidence in statistics refers to the probability that the association exists, not the probability of an individual having the disease. So, I think A is incorrect.Moving on to option B: It states that from the independence test, we're 99% confident that smoking is related to lung disease, so if someone smokes, there's a 99% chance they have lung disease. Again, this seems to confuse confidence with probability. The 99% confidence means we're pretty sure that smoking and lung disease are associated, but it doesn't translate to a 99% chance for an individual smoker. So, B is also incorrect.Option C: It says that if we conclude from the statistic that there's a 95% confidence that smoking is related to lung disease, it means there's a 5% chance of making a wrong judgment. This sounds more accurate. In hypothesis testing, a 95% confidence level means there's a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true, which is a Type I error. So, this statement correctly interprets the confidence level as the probability of making a wrong judgment, specifically a Type I error. Therefore, C seems correct.Finally, option D: It claims that all of the above statements are incorrect. But since I think C is correct, D must be incorrect.So, after analyzing each option, I believe the correct answer is C."},{"question":" There are 38 books on the shelf.

Let me try to remember what I know about ellipses and chords.First, the equation of the ellipse is given as (frac{x^2}{36} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1). I recall that the standard form of an ellipse is (frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1), where ((h,k)) is the center, (a) is the semi-major axis, and (b) is the semi-minor axis. In this case, the center is at (0,0), (a^2 = 36) so (a = 6), and (b^2 = 9) so (b = 3). The problem states that one of the chords is bisected by the point (4, 2). So, this point is the midpoint of the chord. I remember there's a concept called the \\"equation of the chord with a given midpoint\\" in ellipses. I think it involves using the point form of the ellipse and some kind of slope.Let me try to recall the formula. I think the equation of the chord bisected at point ((x_1, y_1)) is given by (frac{xx_1}{a^2} + frac{yy_1}{b^2} = frac{x_1^2}{a^2} + frac{y_1^2}{b^2}). Is that right? Wait, no, that might be the equation of the tangent at that point. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.Alternatively, I remember that if a chord is bisected at a point, then the line joining the center of the ellipse to that midpoint is perpendicular to the chord. So, if I can find the slope of the line from the center (0,0) to the midpoint (4,2), then the slope of the chord would be the negative reciprocal of that.Let me calculate the slope from (0,0) to (4,2). The slope (m) is (frac{2 - 0}{4 - 0} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}). So, the slope of the chord should be the negative reciprocal, which is (-2). Wait, but looking at the answer choices, none of them have a slope of (-2). Let me check the options again:A: (x - 2y = 0) which simplifies to (y = frac{1}{2}x), slope (frac{1}{2}).B: (2x - 3y - 2 = 0) which simplifies to (y = frac{2}{3}x - frac{2}{3}), slope (frac{2}{3}).C: (x + 2y - 8 = 0) which simplifies to (y = -frac{1}{2}x + 4), slope (-frac{1}{2}).D: (x - 2y - 8 = 0) which simplifies to (y = frac{1}{2}x - 4), slope (frac{1}{2}).Hmm, so none of the options have a slope of (-2). Did I make a mistake in calculating the slope?Wait, maybe I confused the concept. Let me think again. The line from the center to the midpoint is perpendicular to the chord only if the ellipse is a circle, right? Because in a circle, the radius is perpendicular to the tangent, but in an ellipse, it's not necessarily the case. So, maybe that approach isn't correct here.Perhaps I should use the point form of the chord. Let me recall that the equation of the chord bisected at ((x_1, y_1)) is given by:[frac{xx_1}{a^2} + frac{yy_1}{b^2} = frac{x_1^2}{a^2} + frac{y_1^2}{b^2}]So, plugging in (x_1 = 4), (y_1 = 2), (a^2 = 36), and (b^2 = 9):[frac{x cdot 4}{36} + frac{y cdot 2}{9} = frac{4^2}{36} + frac{2^2}{9}]Simplify each term:Left side:[frac{4x}{36} + frac{2y}{9} = frac{x}{9} + frac{2y}{9}]Right side:[frac{16}{36} + frac{4}{9} = frac{4}{9} + frac{4}{9} = frac{8}{9}]So, the equation becomes:[frac{x}{9} + frac{2y}{9} = frac{8}{9}]Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominators:[x + 2y = 8]Which can be rewritten as:[x + 2y - 8 = 0]Looking back at the options, that's option C. So, I think that's the correct answer.Wait, but earlier I thought the slope should be (-2), but according to this, the slope is (-frac{1}{2}). Maybe my initial approach was wrong because I assumed it was a circle, but it's an ellipse, so the property doesn't hold the same way. This formula seems more reliable because it's specifically for the chord bisected at a point on an ellipse.Let me double-check my steps:1. I used the formula for the chord bisected at ((x_1, y_1)).2. Plugged in the values correctly.3. Simplified the equation step by step.4. Arrived at (x + 2y - 8 = 0), which is option C.Yes, that seems correct. So, I think option C is the right answer."},{"question":"The maximum number of students among whom 100 pens and 50 pencils can be distributed in such a way that each student gets the same number of pens and same number of pencils is what?","answer":"First, I need to determine the maximum number of students among whom 100 pens and 50 pencils can be distributed equally.To do this, I'll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 100 and 50.The GCD of 100 and 50 is 50 because 50 is the largest number that divides both 100 and 50 without leaving a remainder.Therefore, the maximum number of students is 50. Each student would receive 2 pens (100 pens divided by 50 students) and 1 pencil (50 pencils divided by 50 students)."},{"question":"Factor x^2 + 6x + 9 - 64x^4 into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients. Submit your answer in the form (ax^2 + bx + c)(dx^2 + ex + f), with a < d.","answer":"Okay, so I have this polynomial to factor: ( x^2 + 6x + 9 - 64x^4 ). Hmm, I need to factor it into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients. The final answer should be in the form ( (ax^2 + bx + c)(dx^2 + ex + f) ) with ( a < d ). Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I notice that the polynomial has terms with ( x^4 ), ( x^2 ), and ( x ). Maybe I can rearrange it to make it easier to factor. Let me write it in standard form, starting from the highest degree:( -64x^4 + x^2 + 6x + 9 )Hmm, that negative coefficient on ( x^4 ) is a bit tricky. Maybe I can factor out a negative sign to make it positive. Let's try that:( - (64x^4 - x^2 - 6x - 9) )Now, I have ( 64x^4 - x^2 - 6x - 9 ) inside the parentheses. I wonder if this can be factored into two quadratics. Let me assume it can be written as ( (ax^2 + bx + c)(dx^2 + ex + f) ). Since the leading term is ( 64x^4 ), which is ( (8x^2)^2 ), I can guess that ( a ) and ( d ) are 8 and 8 or maybe 16 and 4, but 8 and 8 seems more likely because 8 times 8 is 64.So, let's assume:( (8x^2 + bx + c)(8x^2 + ex + f) )Now, when we multiply these out, the constant term will be ( c times f ). In our polynomial, the constant term is -9. So, ( c times f = -9 ). The possible integer pairs for ( c ) and ( f ) are (1, -9), (-1, 9), (3, -3), (9, -1), (-9, 1). I'll keep that in mind.Next, the linear term in the original polynomial is -6x. When we multiply the two quadratics, the linear term comes from the sum of the products of the outer and inner terms. Specifically, it's ( b times f + e times c ). So, ( b times f + e times c = -6 ).Also, the coefficient of ( x^2 ) in the original polynomial is -1. This comes from the sum of the products of the middle terms and the constants. So, ( c times e + f times b + (8x^2 times 8x^2) ) wait, no, actually, when multiplying two quadratics, the ( x^2 ) term is formed by:- ( 8x^2 times f ) which gives ( 8f x^2 )- ( bx times 8x^2 ) which gives ( 8b x^3 ) (but we don't have an ( x^3 ) term)- ( c times 8x^2 ) which gives ( 8c x^2 )- Similarly, from the other quadratic, ( 8x^2 times c ) gives ( 8c x^2 )- ( ex times 8x^2 ) gives ( 8e x^3 )- ( f times 8x^2 ) gives ( 8f x^2 )Wait, I think I'm complicating it. Maybe I should use the standard multiplication:( (8x^2 + bx + c)(8x^2 + ex + f) = 64x^4 + (8e + 8b)x^3 + (be + 8f + 8c)x^2 + (bf + ec)x + cf )Comparing this with our polynomial ( 64x^4 - x^2 - 6x - 9 ), we can set up equations:1. Coefficient of ( x^4 ): 64 = 64 (which is fine)2. Coefficient of ( x^3 ): ( 8e + 8b = 0 ) (since there's no ( x^3 ) term)3. Coefficient of ( x^2 ): ( be + 8f + 8c = -1 )4. Coefficient of ( x ): ( bf + ec = -6 )5. Constant term: ( cf = -9 )From equation 2: ( 8e + 8b = 0 ) implies ( e + b = 0 ) or ( e = -b ).Let me substitute ( e = -b ) into the other equations.From equation 5: ( c times f = -9 ). Let's list possible pairs for ( c ) and ( f ):- (1, -9)- (-1, 9)- (3, -3)- (9, -1)- (-9, 1)I'll try each pair and see if they satisfy the other equations.Let's start with ( c = 3 ) and ( f = -3 ):From equation 4: ( b times (-3) + (-b) times 3 = -6 )Simplify: ( -3b - 3b = -6 ) → ( -6b = -6 ) → ( b = 1 )Then ( e = -b = -1 )Now, check equation 3: ( b times e + 8f + 8c = (1)(-1) + 8(-3) + 8(3) = -1 -24 +24 = -1 )Which matches the coefficient of ( x^2 ) in our polynomial. So this works!So, ( b = 1 ), ( e = -1 ), ( c = 3 ), ( f = -3 )Therefore, the factors are:( (8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 - x - 3) )But wait, the original polynomial was ( - (64x^4 - x^2 - 6x - 9) ), so we have:( - (8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 - x - 3) )But the question asks for two quadratic polynomials, so we can write it as:( (-8x^2 - x - 3)(8x^2 - x - 3) ) but that might not be the standard form. Alternatively, factor out the negative sign from one of the factors:( (8x^2 + x + 3)(-8x^2 + x + 3) )To satisfy ( a < d ), since 8 > -8, but we need ( a < d ). So, if we write it as ( (-8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 + x + 3) ), then ( a = -8 ) and ( d = 8 ), so ( -8 < 8 ), which satisfies the condition.Wait, but usually, we prefer leading coefficients to be positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.Original polynomial: ( x^2 + 6x + 9 - 64x^4 ) which is ( -64x^4 + x^2 + 6x + 9 ). When I factored out a negative, it became ( - (64x^4 - x^2 - 6x - 9) ). Then I factored ( 64x^4 - x^2 - 6x - 9 ) into ( (8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 - x - 3) ). So, the original polynomial is ( - (8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 - x - 3) ).But the question asks for two quadratic polynomials, so I can write it as ( (-8x^2 - x - 3)(8x^2 - x - 3) ) or rearrange the terms to have positive leading coefficients but with the negative sign distributed.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the original polynomial without factoring out the negative first. Let me try that approach.Original polynomial: ( x^2 + 6x + 9 - 64x^4 ). Let me write it as ( -64x^4 + x^2 + 6x + 9 ). Maybe I can factor it as ( (ax^2 + bx + c)(dx^2 + ex + f) ) without factoring out the negative.Assuming ( a ) and ( d ) are such that ( a times d = -64 ). Since we need integer coefficients, possible pairs for ( a ) and ( d ) could be (1, -64), (-1, 64), (2, -32), (-2, 32), (4, -16), (-4, 16), (8, -8), (-8, 8), etc.But since ( a < d ), let's consider positive and negative combinations.Let me try ( a = -8 ) and ( d = 8 ). So, ( (-8x^2 + bx + c)(8x^2 + ex + f) ).Multiplying these out:( (-8x^2)(8x^2) = -64x^4 ) (good, matches the leading term)Now, the constant term is ( c times f ). In the original polynomial, the constant term is 9. So, ( c times f = 9 ). Possible pairs: (1,9), (3,3), (9,1), (-1,-9), (-3,-3), (-9,-1). But since the middle terms have positive coefficients, maybe c and f are positive.Next, the linear term in the original polynomial is +6x. When multiplying, the linear term comes from ( b times f + e times c ). So, ( b times f + e times c = 6 ).The coefficient of ( x^2 ) is +1. This comes from:- ( (-8x^2) times f = -8f x^2 )- ( bx times 8x^2 = 8b x^3 ) (but we don't have an ( x^3 ) term)- ( c times 8x^2 = 8c x^2 )- Similarly, from the other quadratic:- ( 8x^2 times c = 8c x^2 )- ( ex times (-8x^2) = -8e x^3 )- ( f times (-8x^2) = -8f x^2 )Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the standard multiplication again.( (-8x^2 + bx + c)(8x^2 + ex + f) )Multiplying term by term:- ( -8x^2 times 8x^2 = -64x^4 )- ( -8x^2 times ex = -8e x^3 )- ( -8x^2 times f = -8f x^2 )- ( bx times 8x^2 = 8b x^3 )- ( bx times ex = be x^2 )- ( bx times f = bf x )- ( c times 8x^2 = 8c x^2 )- ( c times ex = ce x )- ( c times f = cf )Now, combine like terms:- ( x^4 ): -64x^4- ( x^3 ): (-8e + 8b)x^3- ( x^2 ): (-8f + be + 8c)x^2- ( x ): (bf + ce)x- Constant: cfComparing with original polynomial ( -64x^4 + x^2 + 6x + 9 ):1. Coefficient of ( x^4 ): -64 (matches)2. Coefficient of ( x^3 ): (-8e + 8b) = 0 (since there's no ( x^3 ) term)3. Coefficient of ( x^2 ): (-8f + be + 8c) = 14. Coefficient of ( x ): (bf + ce) = 65. Constant term: cf = 9From equation 2: ( -8e + 8b = 0 ) → ( -e + b = 0 ) → ( b = e )From equation 5: ( c times f = 9 ). Possible pairs: (1,9), (3,3), (9,1), (-1,-9), (-3,-3), (-9,-1). Let's try positive pairs first.Let's try ( c = 3 ) and ( f = 3 ):From equation 4: ( b times 3 + e times 3 = 6 ). Since ( b = e ), this becomes ( 3b + 3b = 6 ) → ( 6b = 6 ) → ( b = 1 ), so ( e = 1 )Now, check equation 3: ( -8f + be + 8c = -8(3) + (1)(1) + 8(3) = -24 + 1 + 24 = 1 ). Perfect!So, we have ( b = 1 ), ( e = 1 ), ( c = 3 ), ( f = 3 )Therefore, the factors are:( (-8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 + x + 3) )This satisfies ( a = -8 ) and ( d = 8 ), so ( a < d ) as required.Let me double-check by expanding:( (-8x^2 + x + 3)(8x^2 + x + 3) )Multiply term by term:- ( -8x^2 times 8x^2 = -64x^4 )- ( -8x^2 times x = -8x^3 )- ( -8x^2 times 3 = -24x^2 )- ( x times 8x^2 = 8x^3 )- ( x times x = x^2 )- ( x times 3 = 3x )- ( 3 times 8x^2 = 24x^2 )- ( 3 times x = 3x )- ( 3 times 3 = 9 )Combine like terms:- ( x^4 ): -64x^4- ( x^3 ): (-8x^3 + 8x^3) = 0- ( x^2 ): (-24x^2 + x^2 + 24x^2) = x^2- ( x ): (3x + 3x) = 6x- Constant: 9So, the expanded form is ( -64x^4 + x^2 + 6x + 9 ), which matches the original polynomial. Great!Therefore, the factorization is correct."},{"question":"Given that the element ((1,2) in A cap B), where (A = left{ (x, y) mid a x - y^2 + b = 0 right}) and (B = left{ (x, y) mid x^2 - a y - b = 0 right}), find the values of (a) and (b).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of ( a ) and ( b ) given that the point ( (1, 2) ) is in the intersection of sets ( A ) and ( B ). First, let me understand what sets ( A ) and ( B ) are. Set ( A ) is defined as all points ( (x, y) ) such that ( ax - y^2 + b = 0 ). Similarly, set ( B ) is all points ( (x, y) ) such that ( x^2 - ay - b = 0 ). Since ( (1, 2) ) is in both ( A ) and ( B ), it must satisfy both equations. That means I can plug ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 2 ) into both equations and solve for ( a ) and ( b ).Let me start with set ( A ).

Plugging in ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 2 ) into the equation ( x^2 - ay - b = 0 ):[ (1)^2 - a(2) - b = 0 ][ 1 - 2a - b = 0 ][ -2a - b = -1 ][ 2a + b = 1 ]So that's my second equation: ( 2a + b = 1 ).Now I have a system of two equations:1. ( a + b = 4 )2. ( 2a + b = 1 )I need to solve this system to find ( a ) and ( b ). Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate ( b ):[ (2a + b) - (a + b) = 1 - 4 ][ 2a + b - a - b = -3 ][ a = -3 ]So, ( a = -3 ).

So, ( a = -3 ) and ( b = 7 ).I think that's the solution. Let me just make sure by plugging these values back into the original equations to see if they hold true.For set ( A ):[ a(1) - (2)^2 + b = (-3)(1) - 4 + 7 = -3 - 4 + 7 = 0 ]Yes, that works.For set ( B ):[ (1)^2 - a(2) - b = 1 - (-3)(2) - 7 = 1 + 6 - 7 = 0 ]That also works.

Let me think about how to handle the expression inside the logarithm: ( -x + sqrt{4 + x^2} ).I remember that sometimes, expressions like ( a + b ) can be rationalized by multiplying by their conjugate. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me try multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of ( -x + sqrt{4 + x^2} ), which is ( x + sqrt{4 + x^2} ). But wait, I don't have a denominator here. Maybe I can write it as a fraction over 1 and then multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate.So, let's set:[-x + sqrt{4 + x^2} = frac{(-x + sqrt{4 + x^2})(x + sqrt{4 + x^2})}{x + sqrt{4 + x^2}}]Multiplying out the numerator:[(-x)(x) + (-x)(sqrt{4 + x^2}) + sqrt{4 + x^2}(x) + (sqrt{4 + x^2})(sqrt{4 + x^2})]Simplify each term:1. ( (-x)(x) = -x^2 )2. ( (-x)(sqrt{4 + x^2}) = -xsqrt{4 + x^2} )3. ( sqrt{4 + x^2}(x) = xsqrt{4 + x^2} )4. ( (sqrt{4 + x^2})(sqrt{4 + x^2}) = 4 + x^2 )Now, combine these terms:[-x^2 - xsqrt{4 + x^2} + xsqrt{4 + x^2} + 4 + x^2]Notice that the middle terms cancel each other out:[-xsqrt{4 + x^2} + xsqrt{4 + x^2} = 0]So, we're left with:[-x^2 + 4 + x^2 = 4]Therefore, the numerator simplifies to 4, and the denominator is ( x + sqrt{4 + x^2} ). So, putting it all together:[-x + sqrt{4 + x^2} = frac{4}{x + sqrt{4 + x^2}}]Now, substitute this back into ( g(-x) ):[g(-x) = log left( frac{4}{x + sqrt{4 + x^2}} right )]Using logarithm properties, specifically ( log left( frac{a}{b} right ) = log a - log b ), we can rewrite this as:[g(-x) = log 4 - log (x + sqrt{4 + x^2})]But ( log (x + sqrt{4 + x^2}) ) is just ( g(x) ). So,[g(-x) = log 4 - g(x)]Hmm, so ( g(-x) ) is equal to ( log 4 - g(x) ). Let me compare this to the definitions of even and odd functions.For an even function, ( g(-x) ) should equal ( g(x) ). But here, ( g(-x) = log 4 - g(x) ), which is not the same as ( g(x) ) unless ( log 4 = 0 ), which is not true because ( log 4 ) is approximately 1.386.For an odd function, ( g(-x) ) should equal ( -g(x) ). Let's see:[-g(x) = -log (x + sqrt{4 + x^2})]But ( g(-x) = log 4 - g(x) ), which is ( log 4 + (-g(x)) ). So, unless ( log 4 = 0 ), ( g(-x) ) is not equal to ( -g(x) ). Since ( log 4 ) isn't zero, ( g(-x) ) isn't equal to ( -g(x) ) either.Therefore, the function ( g(x) ) doesn't satisfy the condition for being even or odd. It must be neither.Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from ( g(-x) ), I substituted ( -x ) correctly, simplified the square root, then multiplied by the conjugate to rationalize. The multiplication steps seem correct, and the terms did cancel out as expected. Then, applying logarithm properties, I split the fraction into two logs, which is valid. So, yes, ( g(-x) = log 4 - g(x) ).Since ( log 4 ) is a constant, it affects the function in a way that neither makes it even nor odd. So, yeah, I think my conclusion is right. The function is neither even nor odd."},{"question":"Given triangle ABC with circumcircle k and center O and radius R, and incircle with center I and radius r. Another circle k_{0} is tangent to sides CA and CB at points D and E respectively, and also internally tangent to circle k. Prove that the incenter I is the midpoint of segment DE.","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC with its circumcircle and incircle. There's another circle, k₀, that's tangent to sides CA and CB at points D and E, respectively, and it's also internally tangent to the circumcircle k. I need to prove that the incenter I is the midpoint of segment DE. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, let me recall some properties. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides of the triangle. The circumcircle k has center O and radius R, while the incircle has center I and radius r. Now, circle k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, so it must be located near vertex C, right? It's also tangent to the circumcircle internally, which means it's inside the circumcircle.I think I should draw a diagram to get a better sense. So, triangle ABC with circumcircle k, incircle with center I, and another circle k₀ tangent to CA and CB at D and E, and also tangent to k. Since k₀ is tangent to two sides of the triangle, it might be similar to the A-mixtilinear incircle or something like that. Wait, actually, mixtilinear incircles are tangent to two sides and the circumcircle, so maybe k₀ is a mixtilinear incircle?But in this case, it's tangent to CA and CB, so it's the C-mixtilinear incircle? Hmm, but the mixtilinear incircle touches the circumcircle externally, doesn't it? Or is it internally? Wait, no, the mixtilinear incircle is tangent to the circumcircle internally. So maybe k₀ is the C-mixtilinear incircle. If that's the case, then its center lies along the angle bisector of angle C, which passes through the incenter I.But the problem says that k₀ is tangent to CA and CB at D and E. So, if it's the mixtilinear incircle, then D and E would be the points where the mixtilinear incircle touches the sides CA and CB. I remember that the mixtilinear incircle touches the sides at points that are equidistant from the vertex along the angle bisector. Hmm, but does that mean that the incenter is the midpoint of DE?Wait, maybe I can use some properties of homothety here. Since k₀ is tangent to the circumcircle k, there might be a homothety that maps k to k₀. The center of homothety would lie at the point of tangency. Also, since k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, the center of k₀ must lie along the angle bisector of angle C, just like the incenter I.So, if both centers lie on the angle bisector, maybe the incenter I is somehow related to the center of k₀. Let me denote the center of k₀ as O₁. Since k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, O₁ must be equidistant from CA and CB, which again confirms it's on the angle bisector.Now, since k₀ is tangent to k, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii. Since it's internally tangent, the distance between O and O₁ should be equal to R - ρ, where ρ is the radius of k₀.So, OO₁ = R - ρ.Also, since O₁ is on the angle bisector of angle C, and I is also on that bisector, maybe I can relate the distances CI and CO₁. Let me denote the distance from C to I as CI, and from C to O₁ as CO₁.I know that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the incenter can be expressed as CI = (r) / sin(∠C/2). Similarly, the distance from C to O₁ would be CO₁ = (ρ) / sin(∠C/2). So, CI = r / sin(∠C/2) and CO₁ = ρ / sin(∠C/2).Therefore, the distance between I and O₁ is IO₁ = CO₁ - CI = (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2).Hmm, interesting. So, IO₁ = (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2).Now, I also know that the distance between O and O₁ is OO₁ = R - ρ.But O is the circumradius center, so maybe I can relate O, O₁, and I somehow. Perhaps using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, which is OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that. Yes, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI² = R² - 2Rr.So, OI² = R² - 2Rr.Now, considering triangle COO₁, maybe I can apply Stewart's theorem here. Stewart's theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the length of a cevian. In this case, the cevian would be IO₁, and the sides would be CO, CO₁, and OO₁.Wait, let me recall Stewart's theorem: for a triangle with sides a, b, c, and a cevian of length d to the side a, which is divided into two segments of length m and n, the theorem states that b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn).So, in triangle COO₁, the sides are CO = R, CO₁ = ρ / sin(∠C/2), and OO₁ = R - ρ. The cevian is IO₁, which we found to be (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2). The segments created by the cevian on side CO would be CI = r / sin(∠C/2) and IO₁ = (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2).Wait, actually, in triangle COO₁, the cevian is IO₁, which connects I to O₁. But I is not necessarily on CO, unless I is on CO, which it is because both I and O₁ lie on the angle bisector of angle C. So, actually, in triangle COO₁, the cevian IO₁ is along the angle bisector, so it's a straight line.Therefore, maybe I can apply Stewart's theorem here. Let me denote the sides:- CO = R- CO₁ = ρ / sin(∠C/2)- OO₁ = R - ρAnd the cevian IO₁ = (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2). The segments on CO are CI = r / sin(∠C/2) and IO₁ = (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2). So, the lengths of the segments are m = CI = r / sin(∠C/2) and n = IO₁ = (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2). The total length of CO is m + n = (r + ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2) = ρ / sin(∠C/2), which matches CO₁. Wait, no, CO is R, so maybe I messed up.Wait, no, in triangle COO₁, the side opposite to the cevian is OO₁, which is R - ρ. The cevian is IO₁, which is (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2). The segments on CO are CI and IO, but I is not necessarily on CO. Wait, no, I is on the angle bisector, which is CO. So, in triangle COO₁, the cevian is IO₁, which splits CO into CI and IO₁.Wait, but CO is R, and CI is r / sin(∠C/2). So, IO = CO - CI = R - r / sin(∠C/2). But I don't know if that's helpful.Maybe I should write Stewart's theorem for triangle COO₁ with cevian IO₁.So, according to Stewart's theorem:CO₁² * IO + CO² * IO₁ = OO₁² * CI + CI * IO₁ * CO₁Wait, no, let me get the formula right. Stewart's theorem is:b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn)Where a is the side divided into m and n by the cevian of length d.In this case, the side being divided is CO, which has length R. It's divided into m = CI = r / sin(∠C/2) and n = IO = R - r / sin(∠C/2). The cevian is IO₁, which is (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2). The other sides are CO₁ = ρ / sin(∠C/2) and OO₁ = R - ρ.So, plugging into Stewart's theorem:CO₁² * m + OO₁² * n = CO * (IO₁² + m * n)So, ( (ρ / sin(∠C/2))² ) * (r / sin(∠C/2)) + ( (R - ρ)² ) * (R - r / sin(∠C/2)) = R * ( ( (ρ - r) / sin(∠C/2) )² + (r / sin(∠C/2)) * (R - r / sin(∠C/2)) )This seems complicated, but let me try to simplify.First, let me denote s = sin(∠C/2) for simplicity.Then, the equation becomes:( (ρ / s)² ) * (r / s) + ( (R - ρ)² ) * (R - r / s) = R * ( ( (ρ - r) / s )² + (r / s) * (R - r / s) )Simplify each term:First term: (ρ² / s²) * (r / s) = ρ² r / s³Second term: (R - ρ)² * (R - r / s) = (R² - 2Rρ + ρ²) * (R - r / s)Third term: R * ( ( (ρ - r)² / s² ) + (r / s)(R - r / s) ) = R * ( (ρ² - 2ρr + r²) / s² + (rR / s - r² / s²) )Simplify the third term:= R * ( (ρ² - 2ρr + r² + rR s - r²) / s² )Wait, no, let's compute it step by step.Inside the brackets:( (ρ - r)² / s² ) + (r / s)(R - r / s ) = (ρ² - 2ρr + r²) / s² + (rR / s - r² / s² )Combine terms:= (ρ² - 2ρr + r² + rR s - r² ) / s²Wait, no, the second term is (rR / s - r² / s² ), so when combined with the first term:= (ρ² - 2ρr + r²) / s² + rR / s - r² / s²= (ρ² - 2ρr + r² - r²) / s² + rR / s= (ρ² - 2ρr) / s² + rR / sSo, the third term becomes:R * ( (ρ² - 2ρr) / s² + rR / s )= R * ( (ρ² - 2ρr) / s² ) + R * ( rR / s )= (R ρ² - 2R ρ r ) / s² + R² r / sNow, putting it all together:Left side: ρ² r / s³ + (R² - 2Rρ + ρ²)(R - r / s )Right side: (R ρ² - 2R ρ r ) / s² + R² r / sThis is getting really messy. Maybe there's a better approach.Wait, maybe instead of Stewart's theorem, I can use coordinate geometry. Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system with point C at the origin, and sides CA and CB along the axes. So, let me set point C at (0,0), side CA along the x-axis, and side CB along the y-axis. Then, the incenter I would be at (r, r), since it's equidistant from both axes.Now, circle k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, so its center O₁ must be at (ρ, ρ), where ρ is its radius. Since it's tangent to CA and CB, which are the x and y axes, respectively.Now, the circumcircle k passes through points A, B, and C. Since CA and CB are along the axes, let me assume point A is at (a, 0) and point B is at (0, b). Then, the circumcircle k can be found using the circumradius formula.The circumradius R of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula:R = (a b c) / (4 Δ )Where c is the length of AB, and Δ is the area of the triangle.But since CA is along the x-axis and CB along the y-axis, the coordinates are simpler. The circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of CA and CB.The midpoint of CA is (a/2, 0), and the perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to CA (which is the y-axis) passing through (a/2, 0). So, the perpendicular bisector is the line x = a/2.Similarly, the midpoint of CB is (0, b/2), and the perpendicular bisector is the line y = b/2.The intersection of x = a/2 and y = b/2 is the circumcenter O at (a/2, b/2). The radius R is the distance from O to C, which is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 ) = (1/2) sqrt(a² + b²).So, R = (1/2) sqrt(a² + b²).Now, the circle k₀ is centered at (ρ, ρ) with radius ρ, and it's internally tangent to the circumcircle k centered at (a/2, b/2) with radius R.The distance between the centers O and O₁ must be equal to R - ρ.So, distance OO₁ = sqrt( (a/2 - ρ)^2 + (b/2 - ρ)^2 ) = R - ρ.Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:( a/2 - ρ )² + ( b/2 - ρ )² = ( R - ρ )²Expand the left side:= (a²/4 - a ρ + ρ²) + (b²/4 - b ρ + ρ²)= a²/4 + b²/4 - (a + b) ρ + 2 ρ²Right side:= R² - 2 R ρ + ρ²So, equate both sides:a²/4 + b²/4 - (a + b) ρ + 2 ρ² = R² - 2 R ρ + ρ²Bring all terms to the left:a²/4 + b²/4 - (a + b) ρ + 2 ρ² - R² + 2 R ρ - ρ² = 0Simplify:a²/4 + b²/4 - R² - (a + b - 2 R) ρ + ρ² = 0But R² = (a² + b²)/4, so a²/4 + b²/4 - R² = 0.Therefore, the equation simplifies to:- (a + b - 2 R) ρ + ρ² = 0Factor:ρ ( - (a + b - 2 R ) + ρ ) = 0So, either ρ = 0, which is trivial, or:- (a + b - 2 R ) + ρ = 0Thus,ρ = a + b - 2 RBut wait, R = (1/2) sqrt(a² + b²), so:ρ = a + b - 2*(1/2) sqrt(a² + b²) = a + b - sqrt(a² + b²)Hmm, interesting. So, ρ = a + b - sqrt(a² + b²)Now, let's recall that in this coordinate system, the inradius r is given by r = (a + b - c)/2, where c is the length of AB.But AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC, so c = sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore, r = (a + b - sqrt(a² + b²))/2.Wait, but ρ = a + b - sqrt(a² + b²) = 2 r.So, ρ = 2 r.That's an important relation: the radius of circle k₀ is twice the inradius.Now, the center O₁ of k₀ is at (ρ, ρ) = (2 r, 2 r). The incenter I is at (r, r). So, the segment DE is the chord where k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, which are the x and y axes.Wait, no, in this coordinate system, k₀ is tangent to CA (x-axis) at D and CB (y-axis) at E. So, the points D and E are (ρ, 0) and (0, ρ), respectively. Since k₀ is centered at (ρ, ρ) with radius ρ, it touches the x-axis at (ρ, 0) and y-axis at (0, ρ).So, points D and E are (ρ, 0) and (0, ρ). The midpoint of DE would be at (ρ/2, ρ/2). But the incenter I is at (r, r). Since ρ = 2 r, then (ρ/2, ρ/2) = (r, r), which is exactly the incenter I.Therefore, I is the midpoint of DE.Wait, that seems straightforward in this coordinate system. So, in this specific case where triangle ABC is right-angled at C, the incenter is indeed the midpoint of DE.But the original problem didn't specify that triangle ABC is right-angled. Hmm, so maybe I made an assumption here by placing C at the origin and sides CA and CB along the axes, which effectively made triangle ABC a right-angled triangle. But the problem is for any triangle ABC.So, perhaps I need to generalize this result. Let me think.In the general case, triangle ABC is not necessarily right-angled. However, the key steps I took in the coordinate system might still hold if I can generalize the relations.I found that ρ = 2 r, and in the coordinate system, the midpoint of DE was (ρ/2, ρ/2), which coincided with the incenter I at (r, r). So, if in the general case, the midpoint of DE is at a point that is the incenter, then the result holds.Alternatively, perhaps there's a homothety that maps k₀ to the incircle, with center at I, scaling by a factor of 1/2. Since ρ = 2 r, such a homothety would map k₀ to the incircle, and the points D and E would map to the points where the incircle is tangent to CA and CB, which are the midpoints of DE.Wait, but in the coordinate system, the incircle is tangent to CA and CB at (r, 0) and (0, r), which are indeed the midpoints between (0,0) and (2 r, 0), and similarly for the y-axis. So, in that case, the incenter is the midpoint.But in the general triangle, the incircle is tangent to CA and CB at points which are not necessarily the midpoints of DE, unless DE is such that its midpoint is the incenter.Wait, maybe I can think about the homothety that sends k₀ to the incircle. Since k₀ has radius 2 r and is tangent to CA and CB, and the incircle has radius r and is also tangent to CA and CB, there must be a homothety centered at C that sends k₀ to the incircle, scaling by a factor of 1/2.Under this homothety, the points D and E on k₀ would map to the points of tangency of the incircle with CA and CB. Therefore, the midpoint of DE would map to the midpoint of the images of D and E, which are the points of tangency of the incircle. But since the homothety is centered at C, the midpoint of DE would map to the midpoint of the tangency points, which is the incenter I.Therefore, the midpoint of DE must be I.Alternatively, since the homothety sends k₀ to the incircle with center at C and ratio 1/2, the midpoint of DE, which is a point on k₀, would be sent to the midpoint of the tangency points on the incircle, which is I. Therefore, I is the midpoint of DE.Hmm, that seems to make sense. So, regardless of the triangle, the homothety centered at C with ratio 1/2 sends k₀ to the incircle, and thus the midpoint of DE is mapped to I, implying that I is the midpoint of DE.Alternatively, considering the power of point I with respect to circle k₀. Since I lies on the angle bisector of angle C, and k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, the power of I with respect to k₀ should be equal to the square of the tangent from I to k₀.But since I is the incenter, and k₀ is tangent to CA and CB, the distances from I to CA and CB are both equal to r. The center O₁ of k₀ is at a distance of ρ from CA and CB, which is 2 r. So, the distance from I to O₁ is sqrt( (2 r - r)^2 + (2 r - r)^2 ) = sqrt(r² + r²) = r sqrt(2). But wait, that's in the coordinate system where C is at the origin.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since I is the midpoint of DE, and DE is the chord of contact of k₀ with respect to point C, then the midpoint of DE lies on the polar of C with respect to k₀. But since C is the external homothety center, the polar of C is the common tangent, which is DE itself. Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, since I is the midpoint of DE, and DE is the chord of contact, then the line CI is the polar of the midpoint of DE. But since I is the midpoint, CI is the polar of I, which would mean that I lies on the polar of I, which is only possible if I is the center of k₀, but that's not the case. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.Alternatively, perhaps using inversion. If I invert the figure with respect to a circle centered at C, then the circumcircle k and the circle k₀ would invert to lines or circles, and the incircle would invert to another circle. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.Wait, going back to the coordinate system approach, even though it was for a right-angled triangle, the key relation was that ρ = 2 r, and the midpoint of DE was (ρ/2, ρ/2) = (r, r), which was the incenter. So, in that specific case, it worked out.In the general case, perhaps the same relation holds: ρ = 2 r, and the midpoint of DE is I. To confirm this, maybe I can look for properties of circles tangent to two sides and the circumcircle.Wait, I recall that in a triangle, the mixtilinear incircle touches the circumcircle and the two sides. The radius of the mixtilinear incircle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and other triangle parameters. Maybe the radius ρ of k₀ is related to r in a specific way, such as ρ = 2 r.If that's the case, then the midpoint of DE would be at a distance of ρ/2 from C along the angle bisector, which would be r, matching the inradius. Therefore, I would be the midpoint.Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me denote angle C as γ. Then, the distance from C to I is CI = r / sin(γ/2), and the distance from C to O₁ is CO₁ = ρ / sin(γ/2).We also have that OO₁ = R - ρ, and OI² = R² - 2 R r.Using the Law of Cosines in triangle COO₁:OO₁² = CO² + CO₁² - 2 CO CO₁ cos(angle between CO and CO₁)But since both CO and CO₁ lie on the angle bisector of angle C, the angle between them is zero. Therefore, cos(angle) = 1.So,(R - ρ)² = R² + (ρ / sin(γ/2))² - 2 R (ρ / sin(γ/2)) * 1Expanding:R² - 2 R ρ + ρ² = R² + ρ² / sin²(γ/2) - 2 R ρ / sin(γ/2)Simplify:-2 R ρ + ρ² = ρ² / sin²(γ/2) - 2 R ρ / sin(γ/2)Bring all terms to one side:-2 R ρ + ρ² - ρ² / sin²(γ/2) + 2 R ρ / sin(γ/2) = 0Factor terms:ρ² (1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2)) + 2 R ρ ( -1 + 1 / sin(γ/2) ) = 0Factor out common terms:ρ (1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2)) ρ + 2 R ( -1 + 1 / sin(γ/2) ) ρ = 0Wait, maybe factor differently:Let me factor out ρ:ρ [ -2 R + ρ (1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2)) + 2 R / sin(γ/2) ] = 0Since ρ ≠ 0, we have:-2 R + ρ (1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2)) + 2 R / sin(γ/2) = 0Let me rearrange:ρ (1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2)) = 2 R - 2 R / sin(γ/2)Factor out 2 R on the right:= 2 R (1 - 1 / sin(γ/2))So,ρ = [ 2 R (1 - 1 / sin(γ/2)) ] / (1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2))Simplify the denominator:1 - 1 / sin²(γ/2) = (sin²(γ/2) - 1) / sin²(γ/2) = -cos²(γ/2) / sin²(γ/2)So,ρ = [ 2 R (1 - 1 / sin(γ/2)) ] / ( -cos²(γ/2) / sin²(γ/2) )= -2 R (1 - 1 / sin(γ/2)) * sin²(γ/2) / cos²(γ/2)Simplify numerator:1 - 1 / sin(γ/2) = (sin(γ/2) - 1) / sin(γ/2)So,ρ = -2 R * (sin(γ/2) - 1) / sin(γ/2) * sin²(γ/2) / cos²(γ/2)= -2 R (sin(γ/2) - 1) * sin(γ/2) / cos²(γ/2)= 2 R (1 - sin(γ/2)) * sin(γ/2) / cos²(γ/2)Now, using the identity 1 - sin(γ/2) = 2 sin²(π/4 - γ/4), but maybe it's better to express in terms of cos.Alternatively, note that 1 - sin(γ/2) = (sin(γ/4) - cos(γ/4))², but perhaps not helpful.Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + sin(γ/2)):= 2 R (1 - sin²(γ/2)) * sin(γ/2) / [ cos²(γ/2) (1 + sin(γ/2)) ]= 2 R cos²(γ/2) * sin(γ/2) / [ cos²(γ/2) (1 + sin(γ/2)) ]= 2 R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2))So, ρ = 2 R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2))Hmm, interesting. Now, let's recall that the inradius r = 4 R sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2), where α, β, γ are the angles of the triangle.But maybe there's a relation between ρ and r.Alternatively, in the coordinate system where C is at the origin, we found that ρ = 2 r. So, perhaps in general, ρ = 2 r.Wait, let's see. If ρ = 2 r, then:2 r = 2 R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2))So,r = R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2))But in general, r = 4 R sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2). So, unless sin(α/2) sin(β/2) = 1 / (1 + sin(γ/2)), which might not hold in general.Wait, maybe in the right-angled case, where γ = 90°, sin(γ/2) = sin(45°) = √2/2.Then, r = R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2)) = R (√2/2) / (1 + √2/2) = R (√2/2) / ( (2 + √2)/2 ) = R √2 / (2 + √2 ) = R (√2 (2 - √2)) / ( (2 + √2)(2 - √2) ) = R (2√2 - 2 ) / (4 - 2 ) = R (2√2 - 2 ) / 2 = R (√2 - 1 )But in the right-angled case, r = (a + b - c)/2, where c = sqrt(a² + b²). Also, R = c/2.So, r = (a + b - c)/2 = (a + b - 2 R)/2.But in our earlier coordinate system, we had ρ = a + b - c = 2 r, which matches.So, in the right-angled case, ρ = 2 r, and the incenter is the midpoint of DE.But in the general case, from the earlier relation, ρ = 2 R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2)). And r = 4 R sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2).So, unless 2 R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2)) = 2 * 4 R sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2), which would imply:2 R sin(γ/2) / (1 + sin(γ/2)) = 8 R sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2)Divide both sides by 2 R sin(γ/2):1 / (1 + sin(γ/2)) = 4 sin(α/2) sin(β/2)But in a triangle, α + β + γ = π, so α/2 + β/2 = (π - γ)/2.Using the identity sin(α/2) sin(β/2) = [ cos( (α - β)/2 ) - cos( (α + β)/2 ) ] / 2But (α + β)/2 = (π - γ)/2, so cos( (α + β)/2 ) = cos( (π - γ)/2 ) = sin(γ/2)So,sin(α/2) sin(β/2) = [ cos( (α - β)/2 ) - sin(γ/2) ] / 2Therefore,4 sin(α/2) sin(β/2) = 2 [ cos( (α - β)/2 ) - sin(γ/2) ]So, from earlier:1 / (1 + sin(γ/2)) = 2 [ cos( (α - β)/2 ) - sin(γ/2) ]This seems complicated, and I don't see an immediate simplification. Maybe my approach is wrong.Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the midpoint of DE. Since DE is the chord of contact of k₀ with respect to point C, the midpoint M of DE lies on the polar of C with respect to k₀. But the polar of C is the tangent from C to k₀, which is the line DE itself. Wait, no, the polar of C is the line DE, since DE is the chord of contact.Wait, actually, the polar of C with respect to k₀ is the line DE. Therefore, the midpoint M of DE lies on the polar of C, which is DE itself. But that doesn't directly help.Alternatively, since I is the incenter, and lies on the angle bisector of angle C, and DE is symmetric with respect to the angle bisector, perhaps I is the midpoint.Wait, in the coordinate system, it worked out because of the specific positions. Maybe in general, the midpoint of DE lies on the angle bisector, and since I is on the angle bisector, and the distances from I to D and E are equal, I must be the midpoint.Wait, let me think. Since k₀ is tangent to CA and CB at D and E, then ID = IE, because I is equidistant from CA and CB. Therefore, I lies on the perpendicular bisector of DE. But since DE is symmetric with respect to the angle bisector, the perpendicular bisector of DE is the angle bisector itself. Therefore, the midpoint of DE lies on the angle bisector, and since I is also on the angle bisector, and ID = IE, I must be the midpoint.Wait, that seems like a good argument. Let me formalize it.Since k₀ is tangent to CA and CB at D and E, the center O₁ of k₀ lies on the angle bisector of angle C. The incenter I also lies on this angle bisector. The segment DE is the chord of contact of k₀ with respect to point C, and its midpoint M lies on the polar of C, which is DE itself. However, since DE is symmetric with respect to the angle bisector, the midpoint M must lie on the angle bisector.Now, since I is on the angle bisector and equidistant from D and E (because ID = IE, as I is the incenter and equidistant from CA and CB), I must coincide with M, the midpoint of DE.Therefore, I is the midpoint of DE.Yes, that makes sense. So, the key points are:1. Both I and O₁ lie on the angle bisector of angle C.2. DE is symmetric with respect to the angle bisector, so its midpoint M lies on the angle bisector.3. I is equidistant from D and E, so it must be the midpoint M.Hence, I is the midpoint of DE.**Final Answer**boxed{I}"},{"question":"On the sides (BC), (CA), and (AB) of an acute-angled triangle (ABC) there are points (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1). Prove that2left(B_1 C_1 cos alpha + C_1 A_1 cos beta + A_1 B_1 cos gammaright) geqslant a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma","answer":"Alright, so I've been given this geometry problem involving an acute-angled triangle ABC with points A1, B1, and C1 on sides BC, CA, and AB respectively. The goal is to prove that:[ 2left(B_1 C_1 cos alpha + C_1 A_1 cos beta + A_1 B_1 cos gammaright) geqslant a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ]Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me recall some basic concepts. In any triangle, the cosine of an angle can be related to the lengths of the sides. Also, since the triangle is acute-angled, all the cosines of the angles will be positive, which might be helpful.I think I should start by understanding what each term in the inequality represents. The left side has terms like ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ), which is the product of the length of segment ( B_1 C_1 ) and the cosine of angle ( alpha ). Similarly for the other terms. The right side is a sum of the sides of the triangle each multiplied by the cosine of their opposite angles.Maybe I can relate these terms using some geometric principles. One idea that comes to mind is projecting segments onto the sides of the triangle. Projections often involve cosines, so that might be useful here.Let me consider the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto side BC. If I denote the projection as ( B_2 C_2 ), then the length of ( B_2 C_2 ) would be ( B_1 C_1 cos theta ), where ( theta ) is the angle between ( B_1 C_1 ) and BC. But wait, in this case, ( alpha ) is the angle at vertex A, not necessarily the angle between ( B_1 C_1 ) and BC. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines on some smaller triangles formed by points A1, B1, and C1. For example, in triangle ( B_1 C_1 A_1 ), I can write expressions involving the sides and angles. But I'm not sure if that directly helps with the inequality.Wait, another thought: maybe I can express ( B_1 C_1 ) in terms of the sides of the triangle ABC. Since ( B_1 ) is on AC and ( C_1 ) is on AB, perhaps I can write ( B_1 C_1 ) as a combination of segments on those sides. But that might get complicated.Let me think about the right side of the inequality: ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ). I remember that in a triangle, ( a cos alpha ) is related to the projection of side BC onto the adjacent sides. Specifically, in triangle ABC, the length of the projection of BC onto AB is ( a cos gamma ), and similarly for the others.So, maybe the right side is the sum of these projections. If that's the case, perhaps the left side is somehow related to projections of segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ).Wait, if I consider each term on the left side, ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ), ( C_1 A_1 cos beta ), and ( A_1 B_1 cos gamma ), these might be projections of ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) onto certain sides or directions.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to use some inequality principles here. The problem is asking to prove that twice the sum of these projected lengths is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides themselves.Perhaps I can use the triangle inequality or some form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. But I'm not sure how to apply those directly here.Another approach: maybe consider vectors. If I assign coordinates to the triangle ABC, I can express points A1, B1, and C1 in terms of coordinates and then compute the necessary lengths and cosines. But that might be too involved.Wait, let me think about the areas. The cosine terms can relate to the areas of certain triangles. For example, ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ) could be related to the area of triangle ( B_1 C_1 A ) or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or properties of similar triangles. If I can find similar triangles involving ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ), that might help relate the terms.Wait, another idea: since the triangle is acute, all the altitudes lie inside the triangle. Maybe the points A1, B1, and C1 are related to the feet of the altitudes, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I can't assume that.Hmm, maybe I need to use barycentric coordinates or some other coordinate system to express the points A1, B1, and C1. But that might be overcomplicating things.Wait, let me go back to the projection idea. If I project ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC, the length of the projection would be ( B_1 C_1 cos theta ), where ( theta ) is the angle between ( B_1 C_1 ) and BC. But I don't know what ( theta ) is. However, maybe I can relate this projection to the sides of the triangle.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum of projections of all three segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) onto the sides of the triangle. If I can show that twice this sum is at least the sum of the projections of the sides themselves, that would prove the inequality.Wait, let me think about the projections in more detail. For each side, the projection of the opposite segment onto that side would involve the cosine of the angle at the opposite vertex. So, for example, projecting ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC would involve ( cos alpha ), since ( alpha ) is the angle at A, which is opposite BC.But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Maybe I need to consider the projections of ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) onto the respective sides BC, CA, and AB.Wait, if I do that, then each projection would be multiplied by the cosine of the angle at the opposite vertex. So, for example, projecting ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC would give ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ), projecting ( C_1 A_1 ) onto CA would give ( C_1 A_1 cos beta ), and projecting ( A_1 B_1 ) onto AB would give ( A_1 B_1 cos gamma ).So, the left side of the inequality is essentially the sum of these projections. Now, the right side is the sum of the projections of the sides themselves. So, ( a cos alpha ) is the projection of BC onto BC, which is just BC itself, but wait, no, ( a cos alpha ) is actually the projection of BC onto the adjacent sides, not onto itself.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in triangle ABC, the length ( a cos alpha ) is the projection of side BC onto the altitude from A. Similarly, ( b cos beta ) is the projection of AC onto the altitude from B, and ( c cos gamma ) is the projection of AB onto the altitude from C.But in the inequality, the right side is ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ), which is the sum of these projections. So, perhaps the left side is the sum of projections of segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) onto the respective altitudes or something similar.Wait, maybe I need to consider that each ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ) is the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto the altitude from A, and similarly for the others. Then, the sum of these projections would relate to the sum of the projections of the sides themselves.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to use some inequality that relates the sum of projections of certain segments to the projections of the sides.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of the projections of any segment onto the sides is less than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides themselves. But I'm not sure if that's a standard result.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) is related to the sum of the projections of the sides, and then use some form of the triangle inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz.Wait, let me try to write down what I know:- ( a = BC ), ( b = AC ), ( c = AB )- ( alpha ), ( beta ), ( gamma ) are the angles at vertices A, B, C respectively- Points ( A_1 ) on BC, ( B_1 ) on AC, ( C_1 ) on ABI need to relate ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ), ( C_1 A_1 cos beta ), and ( A_1 B_1 cos gamma ) to ( a cos alpha ), ( b cos beta ), and ( c cos gamma ).Wait, perhaps I can consider the areas of certain triangles. For example, the area of triangle ( B_1 C_1 A ) can be expressed as ( frac{1}{2} B_1 C_1 cdot h ), where ( h ) is the height from A to ( B_1 C_1 ). But I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (c, 0), and point C somewhere in the plane. Then, points A1, B1, and C1 can be expressed in terms of parameters along the sides.But this might get too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, another thought: perhaps use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of the projections of the sides onto each other is related to the sum of the cosines of the angles.Wait, let me think about the right side: ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ). I recall that in a triangle, this sum is equal to the sum of the lengths of the altitudes. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The length of the altitude from A is ( b sin gamma ) or ( c sin beta ), depending on the side.Wait, actually, the sum ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ) is equal to the sum of the projections of the sides onto the opposite sides. For example, ( a cos alpha ) is the projection of BC onto AB, ( b cos beta ) is the projection of AC onto BC, and ( c cos gamma ) is the projection of AB onto AC.But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can relate the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) to these projections.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the projection of a segment onto a side is less than or equal to the length of that segment. So, ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha leq B_1 C_1 ), but that might not directly help.Wait, but the inequality is in the opposite direction. It says that twice the sum of these projections is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides. So, maybe I need to show that each projection ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ) is at least half of ( a cos alpha ), but that might not be true.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) is at least half the sum of the projections of the sides. But I'm not sure how to formalize that.Wait, maybe I can consider that each segment ( B_1 C_1 ) is part of the triangle, and its projection onto BC is related to the projections of the sides. Maybe by some form of the triangle inequality applied to the projections.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is related to the sum of the projections of the sides, and then use some inequality to relate them.Wait, another idea: maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in some way. For example, consider the vectors representing the segments and their projections. But I'm not sure how to set that up.Wait, let me think about specific cases. Suppose points A1, B1, and C1 are the midpoints of the sides. Then, segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) are the midlines of the triangle, each parallel to a side and half its length. Then, ( B_1 C_1 = frac{a}{2} ), ( C_1 A_1 = frac{b}{2} ), ( A_1 B_1 = frac{c}{2} ). Then, the left side becomes ( 2(frac{a}{2} cos alpha + frac{b}{2} cos beta + frac{c}{2} cos gamma) = a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ), which equals the right side. So, in this case, the inequality becomes an equality.Interesting. So, the inequality holds with equality when A1, B1, and C1 are midpoints. Maybe this suggests that the inequality is tight in that case, and generally, the left side is larger.So, perhaps the inequality is a generalization where moving the points A1, B1, C1 away from the midpoints increases the left side, making the inequality hold.But how can I formalize this? Maybe by considering that the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) are each at least half the projections of the sides.Wait, let me think about the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC. If ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) are points on AC and AB respectively, then the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC would be related to the positions of ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ).Wait, perhaps I can express ( B_1 C_1 ) in terms of the sides of the triangle and then project it. Let me denote ( B_1 ) as a point dividing AC in the ratio ( k:1 ), and ( C_1 ) as a point dividing AB in the ratio ( m:1 ). Then, I can express ( B_1 C_1 ) using coordinates or vectors.But this might get too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, another idea: use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of the projections of the sides onto each other is equal to the sum of the cosines of the angles times the lengths of the sides. So, ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ) is a known quantity.But how does that relate to the projections of ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 )?Wait, maybe I can consider that each segment ( B_1 C_1 ) is part of the triangle, and its projection onto BC is related to the projections of the sides. Perhaps by some form of the triangle inequality applied to the projections.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is greater than or equal to the projection of the sum, but I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: perhaps use the fact that the projection of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of projections, but that might not help here.Wait, let me try to write down the projections more formally. Let me denote:- ( P ) as the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC, so ( P = B_1 C_1 cos alpha )- ( Q ) as the projection of ( C_1 A_1 ) onto AC, so ( Q = C_1 A_1 cos beta )- ( R ) as the projection of ( A_1 B_1 ) onto AB, so ( R = A_1 B_1 cos gamma )Then, the left side of the inequality is ( 2(P + Q + R) ), and the right side is ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ).So, I need to show that ( 2(P + Q + R) geq a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ).Hmm, perhaps I can relate ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) to the projections of the sides themselves.Wait, let me think about the projection of BC onto BC, which is just BC itself, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, the projection of BC onto BC is BC, but the projection of BC onto AB is ( a cos gamma ), and the projection onto AC is ( a cos beta ).Wait, maybe I can consider that the sum of the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) onto the sides BC, AC, and AB respectively is related to the sum of the projections of the sides themselves.But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to use some form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM-GM inequality.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of the projections of any three concurrent cevians is less than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides. But I'm not sure if that's a standard result.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is related to the sum of the projections of the sides, and then use some inequality to relate them.Wait, perhaps I can consider that each projection ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) is at least half of the corresponding projection of the side. For example, ( P geq frac{a cos alpha}{2} ), and similarly for ( Q ) and ( R ). Then, summing these up would give ( P + Q + R geq frac{a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma}{2} ), and multiplying by 2 would give the desired inequality.But is this true? Is each projection ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ) at least half of the corresponding projection of the side?Wait, let's consider the projection ( P = B_1 C_1 cos alpha ). If ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) are points on AC and AB respectively, then ( B_1 C_1 ) is a segment inside the triangle. The projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is ( P ).Now, if I consider the projection of the entire side BC onto BC, that's just BC, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, the projection of BC onto BC is BC, but the projection of BC onto AB is ( a cos gamma ), and onto AC is ( a cos beta ).Wait, maybe I need to consider that the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is related to the projections of ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) onto BC.Wait, if I denote ( B_1' ) as the projection of ( B_1 ) onto BC, and ( C_1' ) as the projection of ( C_1 ) onto BC, then the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is ( B_1' C_1' ), which is less than or equal to ( B_1 C_1 ).But I'm not sure how that helps.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is equal to the difference between the projections of ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) onto BC.So, if ( B_1 ) is on AC, its projection onto BC is some length, say ( x ), and ( C_1 ) is on AB, its projection onto BC is some length, say ( y ). Then, the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is ( |x - y| ).But I'm not sure if that's helpful.Wait, maybe I can express ( x ) and ( y ) in terms of the positions of ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ). Let me denote ( B_1 ) as dividing AC in the ratio ( t:1-t ), so ( B_1 ) is at a distance ( t cdot AC ) from A. Similarly, ( C_1 ) is at a distance ( s cdot AB ) from A.Then, the projection of ( B_1 ) onto BC would be ( t cdot AC cos gamma ), and the projection of ( C_1 ) onto BC would be ( s cdot AB cos beta ). Therefore, the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC would be ( |t cdot AC cos gamma - s cdot AB cos beta| ).But this seems too involved, and I'm not sure if it leads anywhere.Wait, maybe I need to use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is related to the sum of the projections of the sides, and then use some inequality to relate them.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides divided by 2.But I'm not sure how to formalize that.Wait, let me think about the problem again. The inequality is:[ 2left(B_1 C_1 cos alpha + C_1 A_1 cos beta + A_1 B_1 cos gammaright) geqslant a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ]I need to show that twice the sum of these projections is at least the sum of the projections of the sides.Wait, maybe I can consider that each term ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ) is at least ( frac{a cos alpha}{2} ), and similarly for the others. Then, summing them up would give the desired inequality.But is this true? Let's see.If I can show that ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha geq frac{a cos alpha}{2} ), then multiplying by 2 would give ( 2 B_1 C_1 cos alpha geq a cos alpha ), and similarly for the others. Then, summing up would give the desired inequality.But is ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha geq frac{a cos alpha}{2} ) true?Well, ( B_1 C_1 ) is a segment inside the triangle, so its length is less than or equal to the length of BC, which is ( a ). Therefore, ( B_1 C_1 leq a ). But then, ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha leq a cos alpha ), which is the opposite of what I need.Hmm, that's not helpful. So, that approach doesn't work.Wait, maybe I need to consider that the sum of the projections is greater than or equal to half the sum of the projections of the sides.But how?Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is greater than or equal to the projection of the sum of the segments. But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think about the projections in terms of vectors. If I consider the vectors representing ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ), then their projections onto the respective sides can be related to the projections of the sides themselves.But I'm not sure how to proceed.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is greater than or equal to the projection of the perimeter or something like that. But I don't think that's directly applicable.Wait, another thought: perhaps use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is related to the sum of the projections of the sides through some geometric transformation or inequality.Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for some inspiration or recall similar inequalities.Wait, I recall that in a triangle, the sum of the cosines of the angles is less than or equal to ( frac{3}{2} ), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that the sum ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma ) is equal to the sum of the projections of the sides onto each other, and then relate that to the projections of the segments.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can consider that each segment ( B_1 C_1 ) is part of a smaller triangle inside ABC, and its projection onto BC is related to the projection of BC itself.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is at least half the projection of BC onto BC, but that doesn't make sense because the projection of BC onto BC is just BC, and ( B_1 C_1 ) is less than BC.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps consider that the sum of the projections of the segments is related to the sum of the projections of the sides through some inequality involving the angles.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of the projections of any three cevians is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides divided by 2.But I'm not sure if that's a standard result.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides minus some term, and then show that the remaining term is non-negative.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: perhaps use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides minus twice the sum of the projections of the segments from the vertices to the points A1, B1, C1.But I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I can express ( B_1 C_1 cos alpha ) in terms of the projections of ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) onto BC.Wait, if I denote ( B_1' ) as the projection of ( B_1 ) onto BC, and ( C_1' ) as the projection of ( C_1 ) onto BC, then the projection of ( B_1 C_1 ) onto BC is ( B_1' C_1' ).Now, the length ( B_1' C_1' ) is equal to ( |B_1' - C_1'| ), which is less than or equal to ( B_1 C_1 ).But I need to relate this to ( a cos alpha ).Wait, perhaps I can consider that ( B_1' ) is the projection of ( B_1 ) onto BC, so ( B_1' ) divides BC into two segments: from B to ( B_1' ) and from ( B_1' ) to C.

Maybe I need to try a different approach.Wait, let me consider the vectors again. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (c, 0), and point C at coordinates (d, e), where d and e are positive since the triangle is acute.Then, points A1, B1, and C1 can be expressed as follows:- A1 is on BC, so its coordinates can be expressed as a weighted average of B and C.- B1 is on AC, so its coordinates can be expressed as a weighted average of A and C.- C1 is on AB, so its coordinates can be expressed as a weighted average of A and B.But this might get too involved, but let's try.Let me denote:- Let ( A = (0, 0) )- Let ( B = (c, 0) )- Let ( C = (d, e) )Then, the sides are:- BC: from (c, 0) to (d, e)- AC: from (0, 0) to (d, e)- AB: from (0, 0) to (c, 0)Now, let me denote:- ( A_1 ) as a point on BC, so its coordinates can be written as ( A_1 = (c + t(d - c), 0 + t(e - 0)) = (c + t(d - c), te) ) for some ( t ) between 0 and 1.- ( B_1 ) as a point on AC, so its coordinates can be written as ( B_1 = (sd, se) ) for some ( s ) between 0 and 1.- ( C_1 ) as a point on AB, so its coordinates can be written as ( C_1 = (rc, 0) ) for some ( r ) between 0 and 1.Now, I can compute the lengths ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) using the distance formula.First, compute ( B_1 C_1 ):( B_1 = (sd, se) ), ( C_1 = (rc, 0) )Distance ( B_1 C_1 = sqrt{(rc - sd)^2 + (0 - se)^2} = sqrt{(rc - sd)^2 + (se)^2} )Similarly, compute ( C_1 A_1 ):( C_1 = (rc, 0) ), ( A_1 = (c + t(d - c), te) )Distance ( C_1 A_1 = sqrt{(c + t(d - c) - rc)^2 + (te - 0)^2} )And compute ( A_1 B_1 ):( A_1 = (c + t(d - c), te) ), ( B_1 = (sd, se) )Distance ( A_1 B_1 = sqrt{(sd - (c + t(d - c)))^2 + (se - te)^2} )Now, the cosines of the angles ( alpha ), ( beta ), and ( gamma ) can be computed using the dot product formula.For example, ( cos alpha ) is the cosine of the angle at A, which is between vectors AB and AC.Vectors AB = (c, 0) and AC = (d, e)Dot product: ( AB cdot AC = c cdot d + 0 cdot e = cd )Magnitudes: ( |AB| = c ), ( |AC| = sqrt{d^2 + e^2} )So, ( cos alpha = frac{cd}{c sqrt{d^2 + e^2}} = frac{d}{sqrt{d^2 + e^2}} )Similarly, ( cos beta ) and ( cos gamma ) can be computed.But this seems too involved, and I'm not sure if it will lead to the desired inequality.Wait, maybe I can instead consider that the projections of the segments ( B_1 C_1 ), ( C_1 A_1 ), and ( A_1 B_1 ) onto the respective sides are related to the projections of the sides themselves.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that the sum of the projections of the segments is greater than or equal to the sum of the projections of the sides minus twice the sum of the projections of the segments from the vertices to the points A1, B1, C1.But I'm not sure.Wait, I'm stuck.

They satisfy two conditions: a + b + c equals zero, and the sum of their squares, a² + b² + c², is 0.1. I need to find the value of a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with sums of variables and their squares, sometimes expanding expressions can help. Since a + b + c = 0, maybe I can square both sides of this equation to see if that gives me something useful. Let me try that.So, (a + b + c)² equals a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Since a + b + c is zero, squaring it gives zero. Therefore, 0 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). But wait, I already know that a² + b² + c² is 0.1. So substituting that in, I get 0 = 0.1 + 2(ab + ac + bc). That means 2(ab + ac + bc) must be -0.1. So, ab + ac + bc equals -0.05. Okay, that's a useful piece of information.Now, I need to find a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴. I recall that there's a formula for the square of a sum of squares, which might help here. Specifically, (a² + b² + c²)² equals a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ + 2(a²b² + a²c² + b²c²). Since I know a² + b² + c² is 0.1, squaring that gives me 0.01. So, 0.01 equals a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ + 2(a²b² + a²c² + b²c²). Hmm, so if I can find the value of a²b² + a²c² + b²c², I can plug that into the equation and solve for a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴. How can I find a²b² + a²c² + b²c²?I remember that (ab + ac + bc)² equals a²b² + a²c² + b²c² + 2abc(a + b + c). Since a + b + c is zero, the last term drops out. So, (ab + ac + bc)² equals a²b² + a²c² + b²c². We already found that ab + ac + bc is -0.05, so squaring that gives (-0.05)² = 0.0025. Therefore, a²b² + a²c² + b²c² equals 0.0025.Now, going back to the earlier equation: 0.01 equals a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ + 2(0.0025). Calculating 2 times 0.0025 gives 0.005. So, 0.01 equals a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ + 0.005.Subtracting 0.005 from both sides, I get a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ equals 0.005. Wait, let me double-check that. If (a² + b² + c²)² is 0.01, and that's equal to a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ plus twice the sum of the squares of the products, which we found to be 0.005, then yes, subtracting 0.005 from 0.01 gives 0.005 for a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴. That seems right.So, after working through the problem step by step, expanding the given equations, and using the relationships between the sums and products of the variables, I arrive at the conclusion that a⁴ + b⁴ + c⁴ is 0.005.**Final Answer**The value of (a^4 + b^4 + c^4) is boxed{0.005}."},{"question":"Find the positive real number x such that lfloor x rfloor cdot x = 72. Express x as a decimal.","answer":"First, let's understand the equation (lfloor x rfloor cdot x = 72). Here, (lfloor x rfloor) represents the greatest integer less than or equal to (x), which means (lfloor x rfloor leq x < lfloor x rfloor + 1).We can denote (lfloor x rfloor) as (n), where (n) is an integer. This transforms the equation into (n cdot x = 72), or (x = frac{72}{n}).Since (n leq x < n + 1), substituting (x) gives:[n leq frac{72}{n} < n + 1]Multiplying all parts by (n) (assuming (n > 0)):[n^2 leq 72 < n^2 + n]We need to find an integer (n) that satisfies this inequality. Let's test possible integer values for (n):- For (n = 8):  [  8^2 = 64 quad text{and} quad 8^2 + 8 = 72  ]  This satisfies (64 leq 72 < 72), but since (72) is not less than (72), (n = 8) does not work.- For (n = 9):  [  9^2 = 81 quad text{and} quad 9^2 + 9 = 90  ]  This satisfies (81 leq 72 < 90), but (72) is less than (81), so (n = 9) does not work.It appears there is no integer (n) that satisfies the inequality (n^2 leq 72 < n^2 + n). Therefore, there is no positive real number (x) that satisfies the equation (lfloor x rfloor cdot x = 72)."},{"question":"Is the following statement true: \\"If a negative number is added to the square of the same number, will the result always be a positive number\\"?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the statement \\"If a negative number is added to the square of the same number, will the result always be a positive number\\" is true. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, let's understand what the statement is saying. It's talking about taking a negative number, squaring it, and then adding the original negative number to that square. The question is whether this sum will always be positive.Let me try to represent this mathematically. Let's say our negative number is ( x ), where ( x < 0 ). The square of this number would be ( x^2 ), and then adding the original number to this square gives us ( x + x^2 ). The statement claims that ( x + x^2 ) is always positive.To check if this is true, I think I should test it with some examples. Let's pick a negative number and see what happens.Let's start with ( x = -1 ). Then, ( x^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 ). Adding ( x ) to ( x^2 ) gives ( -1 + 1 = 0 ). Okay, so in this case, the result is zero, which is neither positive nor negative. Interesting.Wait, the statement says \\"will the result always be a positive number.\\" If it's zero sometimes, then it's not always positive. But maybe I should try another number to see if it can be negative.Let's try ( x = -2 ). Then, ( x^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 ). Adding ( x ) to ( x^2 ) gives ( -2 + 4 = 2 ). That's positive. Hmm, so in this case, it's positive.But earlier, with ( x = -1 ), it was zero. So, it's not always positive. Maybe the statement is not entirely accurate.Let me try another number, say ( x = -0.5 ). Then, ( x^2 = (-0.5)^2 = 0.25 ). Adding ( x ) to ( x^2 ) gives ( -0.5 + 0.25 = -0.25 ). Oh, now the result is negative. So, in this case, it's negative.Wait a minute, so depending on the negative number I choose, the result can be positive, zero, or negative. That means the original statement that the result is always positive is not true.But I want to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a specific range of negative numbers where the result is always positive. Let's explore that.Let's consider the expression ( x + x^2 ) where ( x < 0 ). I can rewrite this as ( x^2 + x ). Maybe I can analyze this quadratic expression to see when it's positive.A quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c ) has its graph as a parabola. In this case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), and ( c = 0 ). Since ( a > 0 ), the parabola opens upwards.The roots of the equation ( x^2 + x = 0 ) can be found by factoring: ( x(x + 1) = 0 ), so ( x = 0 ) or ( x = -1 ).This means the parabola crosses the x-axis at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = -1 ). Since it opens upwards, the expression ( x^2 + x ) will be positive outside the interval ( (-1, 0) ) and negative inside the interval ( (-1, 0) ).So, for ( x < -1 ), ( x^2 + x ) is positive, and for ( -1 < x < 0 ), it's negative.Therefore, the result is not always positive when adding a negative number to its square. It depends on the value of the negative number.To summarize:- If ( x < -1 ), ( x + x^2 ) is positive.- If ( x = -1 ), ( x + x^2 = 0 ).- If ( -1 < x < 0 ), ( x + x^2 ) is negative.This shows that the original statement is false because the result is not always positive; it can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the value of the negative number.I think I've covered different scenarios and even analyzed the quadratic expression to understand the behavior better. This helps in confirming that the statement is not universally true."},{"question":"It takes 6.64 kg (kg) of glutinous rice flour to make one glutinous rice cake.

The universal set ( U ) is all real numbers, ( mathbb{R} ). Set ( A ) is defined as ( {x | -2 leq x leq 3} ), which means all real numbers from -2 to 3, including both endpoints. Set ( B ) is ( {x | x < -1 text{ or } x > 4} ), so it's all real numbers less than -1 and all real numbers greater than 4.First, I need to find the complement of set ( B ) with respect to the universal set ( U ). The complement of ( B ), denoted as ( complement_U B ), includes all elements in ( U ) that are not in ( B ). Since ( B ) is ( x < -1 ) or ( x > 4 ), the complement would be the numbers that are not less than -1 and not greater than 4. So, ( complement_U B ) should be ( {x | -1 leq x leq 4} ).Now, I need to find the intersection of set ( A ) and ( complement_U B ). The intersection of two sets includes all elements that are common to both sets. So, ( A cap (complement_U B) ) would be the set of all real numbers that are in both ( A ) and ( complement_U B ).Set ( A ) is from -2 to 3, and ( complement_U B ) is from -1 to 4. To find their intersection, I need to see where these two intervals overlap. The overlap starts at the higher of the two lower bounds, which is -1, and ends at the lower of the two upper bounds, which is 3. So, the intersection should be from -1 to 3.Let me double-check that. If I take any number between -1 and 3, it should be in both ( A ) and ( complement_U B ). For example, 0 is in both sets. Now, what about numbers less than -1? They are in ( A ) but not in ( complement_U B ), so they shouldn't be included. Numbers greater than 3 up to 4 are in ( complement_U B ) but not in ( A ), so they shouldn't be included either. Therefore, the intersection is indeed from -1 to 3.Looking at the answer choices:- A: ( {x | -2 leq x < 4} ) – This seems too broad because it includes numbers less than -1 and up to 4, which aren't all in both sets.- B: ( {x | x leq 3 text{ or } x geq 4} ) – This doesn't make sense because it's combining two separate intervals with \\"or,\\" which isn't the intersection.- C: ( {x | -2 leq x < -1} ) – This is only part of set ( A ) that's not in ( complement_U B ), so it's not the intersection.- D: ( {x | -1 leq x leq 3} ) – This matches what I found earlier, the overlapping interval between -1 and 3.So, the correct answer should be D."},{"question":"A train 200 m long is running at a speed of 68 kmph.

Hmm, let me see. I remember from the examples given that there's a pattern where n² - 1 equals (n-1) × (n+1). Let me check that with the examples provided.First example: 1² - 1 = 0 × 2. Yeah, that works because 1 - 1 is 0, and 0 times 2 is also 0. Second example: 2² - 1 = 1 × 3. That's 4 - 1 = 3, and 1 × 3 is 3. Okay, that matches. Third example: 3² - 1 = 2 × 4. So 9 - 1 is 8, and 2 × 4 is 8. That works too. Fourth example: 4² - 1 = 3 × 5. 16 - 1 is 15, and 3 × 5 is 15. Perfect, so the pattern holds.So, if I follow this pattern, for any number n, n² - 1 equals (n-1) × (n+1). That makes sense because (n-1)(n+1) is a difference of squares, which equals n² - 1. So, in this problem, A² - 1 is equal to 3577 × 3579. Wait, 3577 and 3579 are two numbers that are two apart. Let me see, 3577 is 3578 minus 1, and 3579 is 3578 plus 1. So, 3577 × 3579 is equal to (3578 - 1)(3578 + 1), which is again a difference of squares. So, that would be 3578² - 1², which is 3578² - 1.So, putting it all together, the equation A² - 1 = 3577 × 3579 becomes A² - 1 = 3578² - 1. If I add 1 to both sides, I get A² = 3578². Taking the square root of both sides, since we're looking for the positive value of A, A must be 3578.Let me double-check that. If A is 3578, then A² is 3578 squared, which is a big number, but when I subtract 1, it should equal 3577 × 3579. Let me compute 3577 × 3579. Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but since I know it's (3578 - 1)(3578 + 1), which is 3578² - 1, and A² - 1 is also 3578² - 1, so they are equal. That checks out.So, yeah, I think A is 3578.

Therefore, Ana's current age is ( 15 - x ).Next, Billy is half of Ana's age, so Billy's age is ( frac{15 - x}{2} ).Mark is four years older than Billy, so Mark's age is ( frac{15 - x}{2} + 4 ).Sarah's age is three times Mark's age minus 4, which translates to ( 3 times left( frac{15 - x}{2} + 4 right) - 4 ).Simplifying the equation:[3 times left( frac{15 - x}{2} + 4 right) - 4 = frac{45 - 3x}{2} + 12 - 4 = frac{45 - 3x}{2} + 8]Since the number of years ( x ) until Ana is 15 is not specified, the final expression for Sarah's age in terms of ( x ) is:[frac{45 - 3x}{2} + 8]"},{"question":"if all of the telephone extensions in a certain company must be even numbers , and if each of the extensions uses all 4 of the digits 1 , 2 , 3 , and 8 , what is the greatest number of 4 - digit extensions that the company can have ?","answer":"First, identify the even digits available for the last position of the telephone extension.

Let me try to understand the definition first.The problem says that for a function f(x) with domain D, if there's a closed interval [a, b] inside D where f(x) is monotonic (either always increasing or always decreasing) and the range of f(x) on [a, b] is [ka, kb], then [a, b] is called a k-level ideal interval. So, basically, the function needs to be monotonic on that interval, and when you apply f to [a, b], you get exactly the interval [ka, kb].Alright, so I need to check each option to see if they have such an interval or not. Let's go through them one by one.**Option A: f(x) = x² (x ∈ ℝ) has a 1-level ideal interval.**Hmm, f(x) = x² is a parabola. It's not monotonic over all real numbers because it decreases on (-∞, 0) and increases on (0, ∞). But maybe on a specific interval, it can be monotonic. Let's think about [0, 1]. On this interval, f(x) is increasing because the derivative f’(x) = 2x is positive for x > 0. The range of f(x) on [0, 1] is [0, 1], which is exactly 1 times [0, 1]. So, [0, 1] is a 1-level ideal interval. So, option A is correct.**Option B: f(x) = eˣ (x ∈ ℝ) does not have a 2-level ideal interval.**f(x) = eˣ is always increasing because its derivative is eˣ, which is always positive. So, for any interval [a, b], the range will be [eᵃ, eᵇ]. For it to be a 2-level ideal interval, we need eᵃ = 2a and eᵇ = 2b. So, we need to solve eˣ = 2x. Let me see if this equation has any solutions.Graphically, eˣ grows exponentially, and 2x is a straight line. They might intersect somewhere. Let me test x=1: e¹ ≈ 2.718, 2*1=2, so eˣ > 2x. At x=0: e⁰=1, 2*0=0, so eˣ > 2x. At x=2: e² ≈ 7.389, 2*2=4, still eˣ > 2x. Wait, maybe they don't intersect? Or do they?Wait, when x is negative, eˣ approaches 0, and 2x becomes negative. So, for x negative, eˣ is positive, and 2x is negative. So, no solution there. For x positive, eˣ is always above 2x? Let me check x=0.5: e⁰.⁵ ≈ 1.648, 2*0.5=1. So, eˣ > 2x. At x=0.2: e⁰.² ≈ 1.221, 2*0.2=0.4. Still, eˣ > 2x. Hmm, maybe they don't intersect? So, does that mean there are no solutions to eˣ = 2x? If that's the case, then there can't be an interval [a, b] where eᵃ = 2a and eᵇ = 2b. So, f(x) = eˣ doesn't have a 2-level ideal interval. So, option B is correct.**Option C: f(x) = (4x)/(x² + 1) (x ≥ 0) has a 3-level ideal interval.**Alright, f(x) = (4x)/(x² + 1). Let's analyze this function. First, it's defined for x ≥ 0. Let's find its derivative to check monotonicity.f’(x) = [4(x² + 1) - 4x*(2x)] / (x² + 1)² = [4x² + 4 - 8x²] / (x² + 1)² = (-4x² + 4) / (x² + 1)² = 4(1 - x²) / (x² + 1)².So, f’(x) is positive when 1 - x² > 0, i.e., x < 1, and negative when x > 1. So, the function increases on [0, 1] and decreases on [1, ∞). So, it's monotonic on [0, 1], which is increasing, and on [1, ∞), which is decreasing.We need to check if there's an interval [a, b] where f is monotonic and the range is [3a, 3b]. Let's first consider [0, 1], since it's increasing. The range on [0, 1] is [0, 2], because f(0)=0 and f(1)=4*1/(1+1)=2.So, if we set [3a, 3b] equal to [0, 2], then 3a=0 and 3b=2. So, a=0, b=2/3. But wait, 2/3 is less than 1, so [0, 2/3] is within [0,1]. Let's check if f([0, 2/3]) = [0, 3*(2/3)] = [0, 2]. But f(2/3) = (4*(2/3))/((4/9) + 1) = (8/3)/(13/9) = (8/3)*(9/13) = 24/13 ≈ 1.846, which is less than 2. So, the range is [0, 24/13], which is not [0, 2]. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the interval is [a, b] where a and b are both greater than 1? But on [1, ∞), the function is decreasing. So, the range would be [f(b), f(1)] = [4b/(b² +1), 2]. For this to be [3a, 3b], we need 4b/(b² +1) = 3a and 2 = 3b. So, from 2 = 3b, we get b = 2/3. But 2/3 is less than 1, which contradicts our assumption that b is in [1, ∞). So, that doesn't work either.Wait, maybe the interval is somewhere else? Let's think differently. Maybe the interval is not starting at 0. Suppose [a, b] is within [0,1], but not starting at 0. So, f(a) = 3a and f(b) = 3b. So, we have:(4a)/(a² +1) = 3a and (4b)/(b² +1) = 3b.Simplify: For a ≠ 0, divide both sides by a: 4/(a² +1) = 3 ⇒ 4 = 3a² + 3 ⇒ 3a² = 1 ⇒ a² = 1/3 ⇒ a = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577.Similarly, for b: 4/(b² +1) = 3 ⇒ same result: b = 1/√3. Wait, so a and b would be the same? That can't be. So, maybe that's not the way.Alternatively, maybe the interval is in the decreasing part, so [a, b] where a > 1. Then, since it's decreasing, f(a) = 3b and f(b) = 3a. So, (4a)/(a² +1) = 3b and (4b)/(b² +1) = 3a.So, we have two equations:4a/(a² +1) = 3b ...(1)4b/(b² +1) = 3a ...(2)Let me try to solve these equations. From equation (1): b = (4a)/(3(a² +1))Plug into equation (2):4*(4a/(3(a² +1)))/( (16a²)/(9(a² +1)²) +1 ) = 3aSimplify numerator: 16a/(3(a² +1))Denominator: (16a²)/(9(a² +1)²) +1 = (16a² + 9(a² +1)²)/(9(a² +1)²)So, overall:[16a/(3(a² +1))] / [ (16a² + 9(a² +1)² ) / (9(a² +1)² ) ] = 3aSimplify division:[16a/(3(a² +1))] * [9(a² +1)² / (16a² + 9(a² +1)² ) ] = 3aMultiply numerator: 16a * 9(a² +1)² / [3(a² +1) * (16a² + 9(a² +1)² ) ]Simplify:(144a(a² +1)) / [3(16a² + 9(a² +1)² ) ] = 3aSimplify numerator and denominator:48a(a² +1) / [16a² + 9(a² +1)² ] = 3aDivide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0):48(a² +1) / [16a² + 9(a² +1)² ] = 3Multiply both sides by denominator:48(a² +1) = 3[16a² + 9(a² +1)² ]Divide both sides by 3:16(a² +1) = 16a² + 9(a² +1)²Expand right side:16a² + 9(a⁴ + 2a² +1) = 16a² + 9a⁴ + 18a² +9 = 9a⁴ + 34a² +9Left side: 16a² +16So, equation becomes:16a² +16 = 9a⁴ +34a² +9Bring all terms to one side:0 = 9a⁴ +34a² +9 -16a² -16Simplify:0 = 9a⁴ +18a² -7Let me set y = a²:0 = 9y² +18y -7Quadratic equation: y = [-18 ± sqrt(324 + 252)] / 18 = [-18 ± sqrt(576)] /18 = [-18 ±24]/18So, y = (6)/18 = 1/3 or y = (-42)/18 = -7/3. Since y = a² must be positive, y =1/3. So, a²=1/3 ⇒ a=1/√3 ≈0.577.But wait, we assumed a >1 in this case, but a=1/√3 <1. Contradiction. So, no solution in this case.Hmm, so maybe there's no interval [a, b] where a >1. What about if the interval crosses 1? Like [a, b] where a <1 and b >1. But then the function is increasing up to 1 and decreasing after 1, so it's not monotonic on [a, b]. So, that can't be.Wait, but maybe the function is monotonic on [a, b] if a and b are both less than 1 or both greater than 1. Since we saw that for a <1, the function is increasing, and for a >1, it's decreasing. So, maybe the interval [a, b] is entirely within [0,1] or entirely within [1, ∞).But earlier, when I tried [a, b] within [0,1], I couldn't find a solution where f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b because it led to a single point. Similarly, in [1, ∞), it didn't work either.Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again. Suppose [a, b] is within [0,1], and f is increasing. So, f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b.So, 4a/(a² +1) =3a ⇒ 4/(a² +1)=3 ⇒ a² +1=4/3 ⇒ a²=1/3 ⇒ a=1/√3 ≈0.577.Similarly, for b: 4b/(b² +1)=3b ⇒ same as above, so b=1/√3. So, a and b are the same, which is not an interval. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the interval is such that f([a, b]) = [3a, 3b], but not necessarily f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b. Wait, no, the definition says the range is [ka, kb], so for increasing functions, f(a)=ka and f(b)=kb. For decreasing functions, f(a)=kb and f(b)=ka.So, in the case where [a, b] is within [1, ∞), and f is decreasing, we have f(a)=3b and f(b)=3a.So, 4a/(a² +1)=3b and 4b/(b² +1)=3a.Let me write these as:4a = 3b(a² +1) ...(1)4b = 3a(b² +1) ...(2)Let me try to solve these equations.From equation (1): 4a = 3b(a² +1)From equation (2): 4b = 3a(b² +1)Let me divide equation (1) by equation (2):(4a)/(4b) = [3b(a² +1)]/[3a(b² +1)]Simplify: (a/b) = [b(a² +1)]/[a(b² +1)]Cross-multiply: a²(b² +1) = b²(a² +1)Expand both sides: a²b² +a² = a²b² +b²Subtract a²b² from both sides: a² = b²So, a = b or a = -b. But since a and b are positive (x ≥0), a = b.But then, if a = b, plugging back into equation (1): 4a =3a(a² +1) ⇒4=3(a² +1) ⇒3a²=1 ⇒a²=1/3 ⇒a=1/√3 ≈0.577.But we assumed a >1, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, no solution in this case.Hmm, so does that mean there's no 3-level ideal interval? But the option says it does have one. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, maybe the interval isn't entirely within [0,1] or [1, ∞), but crosses 1. But then the function isn't monotonic on that interval. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the function is considered on a different interval where it's monotonic. Wait, f(x) =4x/(x² +1) is increasing on [0,1] and decreasing on [1, ∞). So, maybe the interval is [a, b] where a <1 and b >1, but then the function isn't monotonic on that interval. So, that can't be.Wait, maybe I need to consider a different approach. Let me think about the range of f(x). The maximum value of f(x) is at x=1, which is 2. So, the range of f(x) is [0,2]. So, if we need the range to be [3a, 3b], then 3a and 3b must be within [0,2]. So, a ≤ 2/3 and b ≤ 2/3. But then, if a and b are both ≤2/3, which is less than 1, so the function is increasing on [a, b]. So, f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b.So, 4a/(a² +1)=3a ⇒4/(a² +1)=3 ⇒a²=1/3 ⇒a=1/√3≈0.577.Similarly, 4b/(b² +1)=3b ⇒ same result, so b=1/√3. So, again, a and b are the same. So, no interval.Wait, maybe the interval is such that f([a, b]) = [3a, 3b], but not necessarily f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b. But no, the definition says the range is [ka, kb], so for increasing functions, f(a)=ka and f(b)=kb. For decreasing functions, f(a)=kb and f(b)=ka.So, unless the function is constant, which it's not, we need f(a) and f(b) to be ka and kb. So, in this case, since f is increasing on [0,1], we need f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b. But that leads to a single point, not an interval.Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition. It says \\"the range of f(x) on [a, b] is [ka, kb]\\". So, maybe the entire range is exactly [ka, kb], not necessarily that f(a)=ka and f(b)=kb. But for monotonic functions, the range is [f(a), f(b)] if increasing or [f(b), f(a)] if decreasing. So, in that case, for increasing, f(a)=ka and f(b)=kb. For decreasing, f(a)=kb and f(b)=ka.So, in either case, we need f(a) and f(b) to be ka and kb. So, in the case of f(x)=4x/(x² +1), we saw that trying to solve f(a)=3a and f(b)=3b leads to a single point, which isn't an interval. Similarly, trying to solve f(a)=3b and f(b)=3a also leads to a single point.So, does that mean there's no 3-level ideal interval? But option C says it does have one. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, maybe the interval is not within [0,1], but somewhere else. Let me think about the function beyond x=1. For x >1, f(x) decreases from 2 to 0 as x approaches infinity. So, maybe there's an interval [a, b] where a >1 and b >a, such that f([a, b]) = [3a, 3b]. But since f is decreasing, f(a)=3b and f(b)=3a.So, 4a/(a² +1)=3b and 4b/(b² +1)=3a.Let me try to solve these equations again.From the first equation: 4a = 3b(a² +1) ⇒ b = (4a)/(3(a² +1))From the second equation: 4b = 3a(b² +1)Substitute b from the first equation into the second:4*(4a)/(3(a² +1)) = 3a*( (16a²)/(9(a² +1)²) +1 )Simplify left side: 16a/(3(a² +1))Right side: 3a*(16a² +9(a² +1)²)/(9(a² +1)² )Simplify numerator: 16a² +9(a⁴ +2a² +1) =16a² +9a⁴ +18a² +9=9a⁴ +34a² +9So, right side: 3a*(9a⁴ +34a² +9)/(9(a² +1)² )= [3a(9a⁴ +34a² +9)]/[9(a² +1)² ]= [a(9a⁴ +34a² +9)]/[3(a² +1)² ]So, equation becomes:16a/(3(a² +1)) = [a(9a⁴ +34a² +9)]/[3(a² +1)² ]Multiply both sides by 3(a² +1)²:16a(a² +1) = a(9a⁴ +34a² +9)Divide both sides by a (a ≠0):16(a² +1) =9a⁴ +34a² +9Expand left side:16a² +16So, 16a² +16 =9a⁴ +34a² +9Bring all terms to one side:0=9a⁴ +34a² +9 -16a² -16=9a⁴ +18a² -7Let y=a²:0=9y² +18y -7Solutions: y=(-18±√(324 +252))/18=(-18±√576)/18=(-18±24)/18So, y=(6)/18=1/3 or y=(-42)/18=-7/3. Discard negative, so y=1/3 ⇒a²=1/3 ⇒a=1/√3≈0.577.But we assumed a >1, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, no solution in this case.Hmm, so it seems like there's no interval [a, b] where f(x)=4x/(x² +1) has a 3-level ideal interval. But option C says it does. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, maybe the interval is not within x ≥0, but the function is defined for x ≥0. So, maybe the interval is [a, b] where a=0 and b= something. Let's check.If a=0, then f(a)=0, which should be 3a=0, so that's fine. Then, f(b)=3b. So, 4b/(b² +1)=3b ⇒4/(b² +1)=3 ⇒b² +1=4/3 ⇒b²=1/3 ⇒b=1/√3≈0.577.So, the interval [0,1/√3] would have f([0,1/√3])=[0, 3*(1/√3)]= [0, √3≈1.732]. But wait, f(1/√3)=4*(1/√3)/((1/3)+1)= (4/√3)/(4/3)= (4/√3)*(3/4)= 3/√3=√3≈1.732. So, the range is [0,√3], which is [0, 3*(1/√3)] = [0,√3]. So, yes, the range is [3a, 3b] where a=0 and b=1/√3.But wait, the definition says [a, b] must be a closed interval where f is monotonic. On [0,1/√3], f is increasing, so it's monotonic. The range is [0,√3]=[3*0, 3*(1/√3)]. So, yes, [0,1/√3] is a 3-level ideal interval.Wait, but earlier I thought that a=0 and b=1/√3 would give f(b)=√3, which is 3*(1/√3)=√3. So, it works. So, option C is correct.**Option D: f(x)=tan x, x ∈ (-π/2, π/2) does not have a 4-level ideal interval.**Alright, f(x)=tan x. Its domain is (-π/2, π/2). It's increasing on this interval because the derivative f’(x)=sec²x >0. So, it's strictly increasing.We need to check if there's an interval [a, b] within (-π/2, π/2) where tan x is monotonic (which it is) and the range is [4a,4b].Since tan x is increasing, the range on [a, b] is [tan a, tan b]. So, we need tan a =4a and tan b=4b.So, we need to solve tan x=4x for x in (-π/2, π/2).Let me analyze the equation tan x=4x.First, note that tan x is an odd function, so if x is a solution, -x is also a solution. But since we're looking for an interval [a, b], which is closed, we can consider positive solutions.Let me consider x >0. Let's see if tan x=4x has any solutions in (0, π/2).At x=0: tan 0=0=4*0, so x=0 is a solution.But we need an interval [a, b] where a < b, so we need two different solutions. Let's see if there's another solution besides x=0.Let me define g(x)=tan x -4x. We need to find x where g(x)=0.Compute g(π/4)=1 -4*(π/4)=1 -π≈-2.14 <0g(0)=0g(π/6)=tan(π/6) -4*(π/6)=1/√3 - (2π/3)≈0.577 -2.094≈-1.517 <0g(π/3)=tan(π/3) -4*(π/3)=√3 - (4π/3)≈1.732 -4.189≈-2.457 <0Wait, so g(x) is negative at π/6, π/4, π/3, etc. What about near π/2?As x approaches π/2 from below, tan x approaches infinity, so g(x)=tan x -4x approaches infinity. So, g(x) goes from negative at π/3 to positive near π/2. So, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a solution in (π/3, π/2).Similarly, for negative x, since tan x is odd, there's a solution in (-π/2, -π/3).So, there are two solutions: one in (π/3, π/2) and another in (-π/2, -π/3). Let's denote them as x1 and x2, where x1 >0 and x2 <0.So, if we take the interval [x2, x1], then tan x2=4x2 and tan x1=4x1. Since tan x is increasing, the range on [x2, x1] is [tan x2, tan x1]=[4x2,4x1]. So, the range is [4x2,4x1], which is [4a,4b] where a=x2 and b=x1.But wait, the interval [x2, x1] includes x=0, where tan 0=0, which is 4*0=0. So, the range would actually be [tan x2, tan x1]=[4x2,4x1], which is exactly [4a,4b]. So, [x2, x1] is a 4-level ideal interval.But wait, the problem says \\"does not have a 4-level ideal interval,\\" but according to this, it does have one. So, option D is incorrect.Wait, but let me double-check. The function tan x is increasing, so on [x2, x1], it's increasing, and the range is [tan x2, tan x1]=[4x2,4x1]. So, yes, it satisfies the conditions. Therefore, option D is incorrect because it does have a 4-level ideal interval.But wait, the original problem says \\"does not have a 4-level ideal interval,\\" so if it actually does have one, then option D is incorrect. So, the incorrect conclusion is D.Wait, but earlier I thought that the equation tan x=4x has two solutions, one positive and one negative, so the interval [x2, x1] would work. But maybe the problem is that [x2, x1] includes x=0, but x=0 is a solution, so the range would include 0, which is 4*0=0. So, it's still valid.Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the interval [x2, x1] is not closed? No, it's closed. Or maybe the function isn't defined at x=±π/2, but the interval [x2, x1] is within (-π/2, π/2), so it's fine.Wait, but in the original problem, the function is defined on (-π/2, π/2). So, any interval [a, b] must be within that. So, as long as x1 <π/2 and x2 >-π/2, which they are, since x1 is in (π/3, π/2) and x2 is in (-π/2, -π/3).So, yes, [x2, x1] is a valid interval within the domain, and it satisfies the conditions. Therefore, option D is incorrect because it does have a 4-level ideal interval.But wait, the original problem says \\"does not have a 4-level ideal interval,\\" so if it actually does have one, then the statement in D is incorrect. So, the incorrect conclusion is D.Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that the equation tan x=4x has two solutions, so the interval [x2, x1] works. But maybe I made a mistake in assuming that. Let me check numerically.Let me approximate the solution in (π/3, π/2). Let's take x=1 radian≈57 degrees. tan(1)=1.557, 4*1=4. So, tan(1)=1.557 <4. So, g(1)=tan(1)-4≈-2.443 <0.x=1.2 radians≈68 degrees. tan(1.2)=2.572, 4*1.2=4.8. So, tan(1.2)=2.572 <4.8. g(1.2)=2.572-4.8≈-2.228 <0.x=1.3 radians≈74.5 degrees. tan(1.3)=3.602, 4*1.3=5.2. So, tan(1.3)=3.602 <5.2. g(1.3)=3.602-5.2≈-1.598 <0.x=1.4 radians≈80 degrees. tan(1.4)=5.797, 4*1.4=5.6. So, tan(1.4)=5.797 >5.6. So, g(1.4)=5.797-5.6≈0.197 >0.So, between x=1.3 and x=1.4, g(x) crosses zero. So, there's a solution around x≈1.35.Similarly, for negative x, x≈-1.35 is a solution.So, the interval [x2, x1] where x1≈1.35 and x2≈-1.35 is a 4-level ideal interval.Therefore, option D is incorrect because it does have a 4-level ideal interval.Wait, but the original problem says \\"does not have a 4-level ideal interval,\\" so if it actually does have one, then the statement in D is incorrect. So, the incorrect conclusion is D.But wait, in the original problem, the function is tan x, x ∈ (-π/2, π/2). So, the interval [x2, x1] is within that domain, and it's closed. So, yes, it's a valid interval.Therefore, the incorrect conclusion is D."},{"question":"Let ( A B C ) be an isosceles triangle with ( B ) as the vertex of the equal angles. Let ( F ) be a point on the bisector of ( angle A B C ) such that ( (A F) ) is parallel to ( (B C) ). Let ( E ) be the midpoint of ([B C]), and let ( D ) be the symmetric point of ( A ) with respect to ( F ). Calculate the ratio of the distances ( E F / B D ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of EF to BD in this specific isosceles triangle setup. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.First, the triangle ABC is isosceles with B as the vertex of the equal angles. That means sides AB and BC are equal, right? Wait, no, actually, in an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are called the legs, and the third side is the base. Since B is the vertex of the equal angles, that would mean angles at A and C are equal. So, sides AB and CB are equal? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.Wait, no, if B is the vertex, then the equal angles are at A and C. So, sides opposite those angles, which are BC and AB, should be equal. So, AB equals BC. Wait, that can't be because in a triangle, if two sides are equal, the angles opposite them are equal. So, if AB equals BC, then angles at C and A would be equal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with vertex B at the top, and base AC. So, AB and CB are the equal sides. So, AB = CB, making angles at A and C equal. That makes sense. So, point B is the apex, and AC is the base.Now, point F is on the bisector of angle ABC. So, angle ABC is at vertex B, and its bisector would split it into two equal angles. So, BF is the angle bisector. And AF is parallel to BC. Okay, so AF || BC. That should give us some similar triangles maybe?Point E is the midpoint of BC. So, E divides BC into two equal parts. Then, D is the symmetric point of A with respect to F. That means F is the midpoint of segment AD. So, AF = FD.I need to find the ratio EF / BD. Hmm, okay.Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system would help.Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since ABC is isosceles with AB = BC, let me set point A at (-a, b) and point C at (a, b). That way, AB and CB are equal in length, and the base AC is horizontal.So, coordinates:- B: (0, 0)- A: (-a, b)- C: (a, b)Now, point E is the midpoint of BC. Since B is (0,0) and C is (a, b), the midpoint E would be at ((0 + a)/2, (0 + b)/2) = (a/2, b/2).Point F is on the bisector of angle ABC. The angle bisector from B in this coordinate system would be the line that splits angle ABC into two equal parts. Since ABC is at the origin, and points A and C are symmetric about the y-axis, the angle bisector should be the y-axis itself. Wait, is that right?Wait, angle ABC is at the origin between BA and BC. BA goes from (0,0) to (-a, b), and BC goes from (0,0) to (a, b). So, the angle between BA and BC is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the angle bisector should indeed be the y-axis. So, point F is somewhere along the y-axis.Also, AF is parallel to BC. Let me find the coordinates of F such that AF is parallel to BC.First, let's find the direction vector of BC. Since B is (0,0) and C is (a, b), the vector BC is (a, b). So, the direction vector is (a, b). Therefore, AF must also have the same direction vector.Point A is (-a, b). Let me denote point F as (0, f) since it's on the y-axis. Then, vector AF is from A(-a, b) to F(0, f), which is (a, f - b). This vector should be parallel to BC, which is (a, b). So, the vectors AF and BC must be scalar multiples.Therefore, (a, f - b) = k*(a, b) for some scalar k.So, a = k*a => k = 1 (assuming a ≠ 0, which it is since it's a triangle). Then, f - b = k*b = b. So, f = 2b.Wait, that can't be right because if F is at (0, 2b), that would be above point A, which is at (-a, b). But in the triangle, point F should be somewhere inside the triangle, right? Because it's on the angle bisector.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.Vector AF is (0 - (-a), f - b) = (a, f - b). Vector BC is (a, b). For AF to be parallel to BC, their direction ratios must be proportional. So, (a)/(a) = (f - b)/b => 1 = (f - b)/b => f - b = b => f = 2b.Hmm, so F is at (0, 2b). But in our coordinate system, point A is at (-a, b), so F is above A. Is that possible? Let me think.In the triangle ABC, with A at (-a, b), B at (0,0), and C at (a, b), the angle bisector from B is the y-axis. So, moving up along the y-axis from B, we pass through the midpoint of AC, which is (0, b), and then continue to F at (0, 2b). But (0, 2b) is outside the triangle because the triangle's apex is at B (0,0) and base AC is at y = b. So, F is outside the triangle? Hmm, but the problem says F is on the bisector of angle ABC, which is the y-axis, but doesn't specify it has to be inside the triangle. So, maybe F is outside.But AF is parallel to BC. If F is at (0, 2b), then AF is from (-a, b) to (0, 2b), which is a vector (a, b). BC is from (0,0) to (a, b), which is also (a, b). So, yes, AF is parallel to BC. So, that seems correct.Okay, so F is at (0, 2b). Now, point D is the symmetric point of A with respect to F. So, reflection over F. So, if F is the midpoint of AD, then D is the reflection of A over F.So, coordinates of D can be found as follows: since F is the midpoint of AD, then coordinates of F are the average of coordinates of A and D.So, F_x = (A_x + D_x)/2 => 0 = (-a + D_x)/2 => D_x = a.Similarly, F_y = (A_y + D_y)/2 => 2b = (b + D_y)/2 => D_y = 4b - b = 3b.So, point D is at (a, 3b).Okay, so now we have coordinates for E, F, and D.Point E is midpoint of BC: (a/2, b/2).Point F is (0, 2b).Point D is (a, 3b).Now, we need to find EF and BD, then compute their ratio.First, let's compute EF.Coordinates of E: (a/2, b/2)Coordinates of F: (0, 2b)Distance EF is sqrt[(a/2 - 0)^2 + (b/2 - 2b)^2] = sqrt[(a^2)/4 + (-3b/2)^2] = sqrt[(a^2)/4 + (9b^2)/4] = sqrt[(a^2 + 9b^2)/4] = (sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2))/2.Now, compute BD.Coordinates of B: (0,0)Coordinates of D: (a, 3b)Distance BD is sqrt[(a - 0)^2 + (3b - 0)^2] = sqrt[a^2 + 9b^2].So, BD = sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2).Therefore, the ratio EF / BD is [(sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2))/2] / [sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2)] = 1/2.Wait, that's straightforward. So, the ratio is 1/2.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Assigned coordinates correctly? Yes, with B at (0,0), A at (-a, b), C at (a, b). That makes AB = BC, which is correct for an isosceles triangle with apex at B.2. Midpoint E of BC: (a/2, b/2). Correct.3. Angle bisector of ABC is the y-axis. Correct, because ABC is symmetric about the y-axis.4. Point F on y-axis such that AF || BC. Calculated F at (0, 2b). Checked that vector AF is (a, b), same as BC. Correct.5. Point D is reflection of A over F. So, F is midpoint of AD. Calculated D at (a, 3b). Correct.6. Calculated EF distance: sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (-3b/2)^2] = sqrt[(a^2 + 9b^2)/4] = (sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2))/2. Correct.7. Calculated BD distance: sqrt[a^2 + (3b)^2] = sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2). Correct.8. Ratio EF / BD: (sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2)/2) / sqrt(a^2 + 9b^2) = 1/2. Correct.So, all steps seem to check out. Therefore, the ratio EF / BD is 1/2.**Final Answer**The ratio of the distances ( EF / BD ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}."},{"question":"In the binomial expansion of ((x+y)^{n}), the second term equals 240, the third term equals 720, and the fourth term equals 1080. Find (x, y), and (n).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the binomial expansion of (x + y)^n. The second term is 240, the third term is 720, and the fourth term is 1080. I need to find x, y, and n. Hmm, binomial expansion... I remember that each term in the expansion is given by the combination formula. Let me recall: the k-th term is C(n, k-1) * x^(n - (k-1)) * y^(k-1). So, for the second term, k=2, which would be C(n,1) * x^(n-1) * y^1. Similarly, the third term is C(n,2) * x^(n-2) * y^2, and the fourth term is C(n,3) * x^(n-3) * y^3.Alright, so let me write down these terms:1. Second term: C(n,1) * x^(n-1) * y = 2402. Third term: C(n,2) * x^(n-2) * y^2 = 7203. Fourth term: C(n,3) * x^(n-3) * y^3 = 1080I think I can use these equations to solve for x, y, and n. Since there are three equations and three unknowns, it should be possible. Let me write the combinations explicitly:C(n,1) = nC(n,2) = n(n-1)/2C(n,3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6So substituting these into the equations:1. n * x^(n-1) * y = 2402. [n(n-1)/2] * x^(n-2) * y^2 = 7203. [n(n-1)(n-2)/6] * x^(n-3) * y^3 = 1080Hmm, these equations look a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify them by dividing one equation by another to eliminate some variables. Let me try dividing the second equation by the first equation:([n(n-1)/2] * x^(n-2) * y^2) / (n * x^(n-1) * y) = 720 / 240Simplifying the left side:[n(n-1)/2] / n = (n-1)/2x^(n-2) / x^(n-1) = x^(-1) = 1/xy^2 / y = ySo overall, the left side becomes (n-1)/2 * (1/x) * yThe right side is 720 / 240 = 3So, (n-1)/2 * (y/x) = 3Let me denote y/x as t for simplicity. So, t = y/x.Then, the equation becomes:(n-1)/2 * t = 3Multiply both sides by 2:(n-1) * t = 6  ...(Equation A)Okay, now let me divide the third equation by the second equation:([n(n-1)(n-2)/6] * x^(n-3) * y^3) / ([n(n-1)/2] * x^(n-2) * y^2) = 1080 / 720Simplify the left side:[n(n-1)(n-2)/6] / [n(n-1)/2] = (n-2)/3x^(n-3) / x^(n-2) = x^(-1) = 1/xy^3 / y^2 = ySo overall, the left side becomes (n-2)/3 * (1/x) * yThe right side is 1080 / 720 = 1.5So, (n-2)/3 * (y/x) = 1.5Again, using t = y/x, this becomes:(n-2)/3 * t = 1.5Multiply both sides by 3:(n-2) * t = 4.5  ...(Equation B)Now, I have two equations:Equation A: (n-1) * t = 6Equation B: (n-2) * t = 4.5I can solve these two equations for n and t. Let me write them again:1. (n - 1) * t = 62. (n - 2) * t = 4.5Let me divide Equation A by Equation B to eliminate t:[(n - 1) * t] / [(n - 2) * t] = 6 / 4.5Simplify:(n - 1)/(n - 2) = 6 / 4.5Calculate 6 / 4.5:6 divided by 4.5 is the same as 60 divided by 45, which simplifies to 4/3.So, (n - 1)/(n - 2) = 4/3Cross-multiplying:3(n - 1) = 4(n - 2)Expand both sides:3n - 3 = 4n - 8Subtract 3n from both sides:-3 = n - 8Add 8 to both sides:5 = nSo, n = 5.Now that I have n, I can find t from Equation A:(n - 1) * t = 6(5 - 1) * t = 64t = 6t = 6 / 4 = 1.5So, t = y/x = 1.5, which means y = 1.5x.Now, let's substitute n = 5 and y = 1.5x into the first equation:n * x^(n - 1) * y = 2405 * x^(5 - 1) * (1.5x) = 240Simplify:5 * x^4 * 1.5x = 240Multiply 5 and 1.5:5 * 1.5 = 7.5So, 7.5 * x^5 = 240Divide both sides by 7.5:x^5 = 240 / 7.5Calculate 240 divided by 7.5:240 / 7.5 = 32So, x^5 = 32Take the fifth root of both sides:x = 32^(1/5)Since 32 is 2^5, so x = 2.Now, since y = 1.5x, substitute x = 2:y = 1.5 * 2 = 3So, x = 2, y = 3, and n = 5.Let me double-check these values with the original terms to make sure they work.First term: C(5,0) * 2^5 * 3^0 = 1 * 32 * 1 = 32Second term: C(5,1) * 2^4 * 3^1 = 5 * 16 * 3 = 240 ✔️Third term: C(5,2) * 2^3 * 3^2 = 10 * 8 * 9 = 720 ✔️Fourth term: C(5,3) * 2^2 * 3^3 = 10 * 4 * 27 = 1080 ✔️Looks good!

This involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is ( 1 - 3i ).After multiplying, I expand both the numerator and the denominator. In the numerator, I use the distributive property to multiply ( (1 - i) ) by ( (1 - 3i) ). In the denominator, I apply the difference of squares formula to simplify ( (1 + 3i)(1 - 3i) ).Once the multiplication is complete, I simplify both the numerator and the denominator.

Hmm, angle bisectors... I remember that angle bisectors are lines that divide the angle between two given lines into two equal angles. But how do I actually find their equations?First, maybe I should recall the formula for the angle bisectors between two lines. I think it involves the equations of the lines and their normal vectors. Let me see... I remember that for two lines (a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0) and (a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0), the angle bisectors can be found using the formula:[frac{a_1x + b_1y + c_1}{sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2}} = pm frac{a_2x + b_2y + c_2}{sqrt{a_2^2 + b_2^2}}]So, I need to apply this formula to the given lines. Let me write down the given lines in the standard form:First line: (4x - 3y = 7). To match the formula, I can write it as (4x - 3y - 7 = 0).Second line: (12x + 5y = 7). Similarly, I can write it as (12x + 5y - 7 = 0).Now, applying the angle bisector formula:[frac{4x - 3y - 7}{sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = pm frac{12x + 5y - 7}{sqrt{12^2 + 5^2}}]Calculating the denominators:[sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = sqrt{16 + 9} = sqrt{25} = 5][sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = sqrt{144 + 25} = sqrt{169} = 13]So, substituting back:[frac{4x - 3y - 7}{5} = pm frac{12x + 5y - 7}{13}]Now, I need to solve for both the positive and negative cases.**Case 1: Positive sign**[frac{4x - 3y - 7}{5} = frac{12x + 5y - 7}{13}]Cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators:[13(4x - 3y - 7) = 5(12x + 5y - 7)]Expanding both sides:Left side: (13 times 4x = 52x), (13 times (-3y) = -39y), (13 times (-7) = -91)Right side: (5 times 12x = 60x), (5 times 5y = 25y), (5 times (-7) = -35)So, the equation becomes:[52x - 39y - 91 = 60x + 25y - 35]Now, let's bring all terms to one side:Subtract (60x + 25y - 35) from both sides:[52x - 39y - 91 - 60x - 25y + 35 = 0]Combine like terms:(52x - 60x = -8x)(-39y - 25y = -64y)(-91 + 35 = -56)So, the equation simplifies to:[-8x - 64y - 56 = 0]I can divide the entire equation by -8 to simplify:[x + 8y + 7 = 0]Wait, that doesn't seem right because the original lines had constants on the right side. Let me check my steps again.Wait, when I cross-multiplied, I had:(13(4x - 3y - 7) = 5(12x + 5y - 7))Which is:(52x - 39y - 91 = 60x + 25y - 35)Then moving all terms to the left:(52x - 39y - 91 - 60x - 25y + 35 = 0)Which is:(-8x - 64y - 56 = 0)Dividing by -8:(x + 8y + 7 = 0)But the original lines were (4x - 3y = 7) and (12x + 5y = 7). So, the bisector should also have a constant term similar to 7. Maybe I made a mistake in the cross-multiplication step.Wait, let's re-examine the cross-multiplication:(13(4x - 3y - 7) = 5(12x + 5y - 7))Which is:(52x - 39y - 91 = 60x + 25y - 35)Moving all terms to the left:(52x - 39y - 91 - 60x - 25y + 35 = 0)Simplify:(52x - 60x = -8x)(-39y -25y = -64y)(-91 +35 = -56)So, it's correct: (-8x -64y -56 =0)Divide by -8:(x + 8y +7=0)But this seems inconsistent with the original lines. Maybe I should not have moved all terms to the left? Let me try another approach.Alternatively, after cross-multiplying:(52x - 39y -91 = 60x +25y -35)Bring all terms to the left:(52x -39y -91 -60x -25y +35=0)Which is:(-8x -64y -56=0)Divide by -8:(x +8y +7=0)Hmm, perhaps this is correct, but let me check if this line is indeed an angle bisector.Alternatively, maybe I should have kept the constants on the right side when cross-multiplying.Wait, let's try another method. Instead of cross-multiplying, maybe I can write both sides as equal to a variable and solve.Let me denote:[frac{4x - 3y -7}{5} = frac{12x +5y -7}{13} = k]But I think that complicates things more. Maybe I should instead use the formula for angle bisectors in terms of direction vectors.Wait, another approach: The angle bisector can be found by ensuring that the distance from any point on the bisector to both lines is equal.The distance from a point ((x, y)) to the first line (4x -3y -7=0) is:[frac{|4x -3y -7|}{sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = frac{|4x -3y -7|}{5}]Similarly, the distance to the second line (12x +5y -7=0) is:[frac{|12x +5y -7|}{sqrt{12^2 +5^2}} = frac{|12x +5y -7|}{13}]For the angle bisector, these distances are equal:[frac{|4x -3y -7|}{5} = frac{|12x +5y -7|}{13}]Which is the same as the formula I used earlier. So, I think my initial approach was correct.But when I solved it, I got (x +8y +7=0), which seems a bit off because the original lines have positive constants. Maybe I should consider the direction of the bisectors.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when cross-multiplying. Let me check:Starting from:[frac{4x -3y -7}{5} = frac{12x +5y -7}{13}]Cross-multiplying:(13(4x -3y -7) = 5(12x +5y -7))Which is:(52x -39y -91 = 60x +25y -35)Subtract (60x +25y -35) from both sides:(52x -39y -91 -60x -25y +35 =0)Simplify:(-8x -64y -56=0)Divide by -8:(x +8y +7=0)Hmm, that's correct. Maybe this is one of the bisectors, but let's check the other case.**Case 2: Negative sign**[frac{4x -3y -7}{5} = -frac{12x +5y -7}{13}]Cross-multiplying:(13(4x -3y -7) = -5(12x +5y -7))Expanding both sides:Left side: (52x -39y -91)Right side: (-60x -25y +35)So, the equation becomes:(52x -39y -91 = -60x -25y +35)Bring all terms to the left:(52x -39y -91 +60x +25y -35=0)Combine like terms:(52x +60x =112x)(-39y +25y =-14y)(-91 -35 =-126)So, the equation simplifies to:(112x -14y -126=0)Divide by 14 to simplify:(8x - y -9=0)Which can be written as:(8x - y =9)Okay, that looks more reasonable. So, we have two angle bisectors: (x +8y +7=0) and (8x - y =9).Wait, but the first one, (x +8y +7=0), seems to have a negative constant term, while the original lines have positive constants. Maybe I should check if this is correct.Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the direction of the normal vectors. The normal vector of the first line is (4, -3), and the normal vector of the second line is (12,5). The angle bisectors should be in the direction of the sum and difference of these normals.Wait, another method: The angle bisectors can be found by normalizing the normal vectors and then adding or subtracting them.The normal vector of the first line is (4, -3) with magnitude 5, and the normal vector of the second line is (12,5) with magnitude 13.So, the unit normals are:First line: ((4/5, -3/5))Second line: ((12/13, 5/13))Then, the angle bisectors' normals would be the sum and difference of these unit normals.Sum: ((4/5 +12/13, -3/5 +5/13))Difference: ((4/5 -12/13, -3/5 -5/13))Calculating the sum:(4/5 +12/13 = (52 +60)/65 =112/65)(-3/5 +5/13 = (-39 +25)/65 =-14/65)So, the normal vector for the first bisector is (112/65, -14/65). We can write the equation as:(112x -14y +c=0)To find c, we can use the fact that the bisector passes through the intersection point of the original lines.Wait, do I know the intersection point? Let me find it.Solving (4x -3y =7) and (12x +5y =7).Let me solve these two equations:Multiply the first equation by 3: (12x -9y =21)Subtract the second equation: (12x +5y =7)Subtracting: (12x -9y -12x -5y =21 -7)Simplify: (-14y=14)So, (y= -1)Substitute back into first equation: (4x -3*(-1)=7)(4x +3=7)(4x=4)(x=1)So, the intersection point is (1, -1).Now, plug this into the bisector equation (112x -14y +c=0):(112*1 -14*(-1) +c=0)(112 +14 +c=0)(126 +c=0)So, (c= -126)Thus, the equation is:(112x -14y -126=0)Divide by 14:(8x - y -9=0)Which is the same as (8x - y =9), which matches the earlier result.Now, for the other bisector, using the difference of the unit normals:Difference: ((4/5 -12/13, -3/5 -5/13))Calculating:(4/5 -12/13 = (52 -60)/65 =-8/65)(-3/5 -5/13 = (-39 -25)/65 =-64/65)So, the normal vector is (-8/65, -64/65). The equation is:(-8x -64y +c=0)Again, using the intersection point (1, -1):(-8*1 -64*(-1) +c=0)(-8 +64 +c=0)(56 +c=0)So, (c= -56)Thus, the equation is:(-8x -64y -56=0)Divide by -8:(x +8y +7=0)Which is the same as before.So, both methods give the same results: (8x - y =9) and (x +8y +7=0).Wait, but the second equation (x +8y +7=0) can be written as (x +8y = -7). Is this correct? Let me check if this line is indeed an angle bisector.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the direction of the bisectors. The first bisector (8x - y =9) seems to be in the direction of the sum of the normals, which would be the internal bisector, while the other one (x +8y = -7) is the external bisector.But to confirm, let me pick a point on one side of the lines and see which bisector it lies on.For example, take the origin (0,0). Plug into the original lines:First line: (4*0 -3*0 =0 <7), so origin is on one side.Second line: (12*0 +5*0=0 <7), so origin is on the same side for both lines.Now, plug into the bisectors:First bisector: (8*0 -0 =0 <9), so origin is on one side.Second bisector: (0 +8*0 =0 >-7), so origin is on the other side.This suggests that the first bisector (8x - y =9) is the internal bisector, and the second one (x +8y = -7) is the external bisector.Alternatively, maybe I should have kept the constants positive. Let me see.Wait, the original lines are (4x -3y =7) and (12x +5y =7). The bisectors should also have constants that make sense. The first bisector (8x - y =9) seems reasonable, but the second one (x +8y = -7) might be correct as well, depending on the angle.Alternatively, perhaps I should have written the second bisector as (x +8y =7) instead of (x +8y = -7). Let me check.Wait, when I used the intersection point (1, -1), I got (c= -56), leading to (x +8y +7=0) or (x +8y = -7). But maybe I should have considered the direction of the normal vector.The normal vector for the second bisector was (-8/65, -64/65), which points in the direction opposite to (8,64). So, the equation (x +8y = -7) is correct.Alternatively, if I had taken the normal vector as (8,64), the equation would be (8x +64y = c). Plugging in (1, -1):(8*1 +64*(-1) =8 -64= -56), so (c= -56), leading to (8x +64y = -56), which simplifies to (x +8y = -7).So, yes, it's correct.Therefore, the two angle bisectors are (8x - y =9) and (x +8y = -7).But wait, the user asked for the equations of the angle bisectors of the regions defined by the lines. So, maybe both are needed.Alternatively, sometimes angle bisectors are considered as two lines, one for each angle between the original lines. So, both are correct.But let me double-check the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.Starting from the formula:[frac{4x -3y -7}{5} = pm frac{12x +5y -7}{13}]For the positive case:[13(4x -3y -7) =5(12x +5y -7)]Which simplifies to:(52x -39y -91 =60x +25y -35)Bringing all terms to the left:(-8x -64y -56=0)Divide by -8:(x +8y +7=0) or (x +8y = -7)For the negative case:[13(4x -3y -7) =-5(12x +5y -7)]Which simplifies to:(52x -39y -91 =-60x -25y +35)Bringing all terms to the left:(112x -14y -126=0)Divide by 14:(8x - y -9=0) or (8x - y =9)Yes, that's correct.So, the two angle bisectors are:1. (8x - y =9)2. (x +8y = -7)These are the equations of the angle bisectors for the given lines."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = log_{a}x, its inverse function is denoted as f^{-1}(x).

Prove that ( n ) can be divided by 4.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I have a bunch of variables, each of which is either +1 or -1. They're arranged in a sequence, and there's this big sum involving products of four consecutive variables each time. The sum equals zero, and I need to prove that the number of variables, n, must be divisible by 4.Okay, let's break this down. Each term in the sum is a product of four consecutive variables. Since each variable is either +1 or -1, each product term will also be either +1 or -1. So, the entire sum is just adding up a bunch of +1s and -1s.The sum is zero, which means that the number of +1s and -1s must be equal. If I have an equal number of +1s and -1s, then the total number of terms must be even. So, n must be even. That's a start.But the problem wants me to prove that n is divisible by 4, not just even. So, being even is necessary but not sufficient. I need to dig deeper.Let me think about the structure of the sum. Each term is a product of four consecutive variables, and the sequence wraps around, meaning after the last variable, it goes back to the first one. So, it's like a circular arrangement.Maybe I can consider the product of all these terms together. If I multiply all the terms in the sum, what do I get? Each variable appears in four different terms because each variable is part of four consecutive quadruples. For example, x1 appears in the first term, the second term, the third term, and the last term. So, each variable is multiplied four times in the overall product.Since each variable is either +1 or -1, raising it to the fourth power will always give +1. So, the product of all the terms is (+1)^n, which is just +1. But wait, the product of all the terms is also equal to the product of all the individual products. Each individual product is either +1 or -1, and there are n such products.So, the product of all the terms is equal to the product of n terms, each of which is either +1 or -1. Let's denote the product as P. Then, P = (±1)^n. But we already established that P = +1. So, (±1)^n = +1. This implies that the number of -1s in the product must be even because (-1)^even = +1.But earlier, we saw that the sum of the terms is zero, which means there are an equal number of +1s and -1s. So, the number of -1s is n/2, which must be even. Therefore, n/2 is even, which means n is divisible by 4.Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps there. So, the sum being zero implies an equal number of +1s and -1s, so n must be even. Then, considering the product of all terms, which is +1, and since each term is either +1 or -1, the number of -1s must be even. But since n is even, n/2 is the number of -1s, which must also be even. Therefore, n must be divisible by 4.Yeah, that seems to make sense. Let me try to think of a concrete example to test this. Suppose n=4. Then, we have four variables: x1, x2, x3, x4. The sum would be x1x2x3x4 + x2x3x4x1 + x3x4x1x2 + x4x1x2x3. Each term is the same product, just rotated. So, all terms are equal. If all variables are +1, then each term is +1, and the sum is 4, which isn't zero. If two variables are -1 and two are +1, let's see: suppose x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=+1, x4=+1. Then, x1x2x3x4 = (-1)(-1)(1)(1)=1, x2x3x4x1=(-1)(1)(1)(-1)=1, x3x4x1x2=(1)(1)(-1)(-1)=1, x4x1x2x3=(1)(-1)(-1)(1)=1. So, the sum is 4 again. Hmm, not zero. Maybe n=4 isn't possible? Wait, but according to the problem, n must be divisible by 4, but in this case, n=4, and I can't get the sum to zero. Maybe I need a different arrangement.Wait, maybe if n=8. Let's try n=8. Suppose we have four +1s and four -1s arranged in some pattern. Maybe alternating +1 and -1. Let's see: x1=+1, x2=-1, x3=+1, x4=-1, x5=+1, x6=-1, x7=+1, x8=-1. Then, each product term would be (+1)(-1)(+1)(-1)=1, and there are 8 such terms, so the sum would be 8, which is not zero. Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe if I have two +1s and two -1s in a row. Let's say x1=+1, x2=+1, x3=-1, x4=-1, x5=+1, x6=+1, x7=-1, x8=-1. Then, the first term is (+1)(+1)(-1)(-1)=1, the second term is (+1)(-1)(-1)(+1)=1, the third term is (-1)(-1)(+1)(+1)=1, the fourth term is (-1)(+1)(+1)(-1)=1, the fifth term is (+1)(+1)(-1)(-1)=1, the sixth term is (+1)(-1)(-1)(+1)=1, the seventh term is (-1)(-1)(+1)(+1)=1, the eighth term is (-1)(+1)(+1)(-1)=1. So, again, the sum is 8. Not zero.Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of trying specific examples, maybe I should stick to the general proof.So, from the sum being zero, we have that the number of +1s and -1s must be equal, so n is even. Then, considering the product of all terms, which is +1, and since each term is either +1 or -1, the number of -1s must be even. Since n is even, n/2 is the number of -1s, which must also be even, so n must be divisible by 4.Yeah, that seems solid. I think I've got it."},{"question":"Xiao Ming designed a magic box.

Find the value of m.","answer":"First, I need to understand how the magic box works. It takes a pair of real numbers ((a, b)) and transforms them into a new real number using the formula (a^2 + 2b - 3).Given the input ((m, -3m)), the output is 4. So, I can set up the equation based on the magic box's transformation:[m^2 + 2(-3m) - 3 = 4]Next, I'll simplify this equation step by step. First, distribute the 2 into the parentheses:[m^2 - 6m - 3 = 4]To solve for (m), I'll move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:[m^2 - 6m - 7 = 0]Now, I have a quadratic equation.

The options are:A: -frac{4}{3}B: frac{4}{3}C: -frac{3}{4}D: frac{3}{4}","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of tan φ, given that cos(3π/2 - φ) = 3/5 and that |φ| < π/2. The options are A: -4/3, B: 4/3, C: -3/4, D: 3/4. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that relate cosine and sine functions with angle differences. Specifically, I think cos(3π/2 - φ) can be rewritten using a co-function identity. Let me recall: cos(3π/2 - φ) is equal to sin φ, but wait, is it positive or negative? I think it's negative because of the angle being in a different quadrant. Let me verify that.The cosine of an angle can be expressed using the identity cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. So, applying this to cos(3π/2 - φ):cos(3π/2 - φ) = cos(3π/2)cos φ + sin(3π/2)sin φ.I know that cos(3π/2) is 0 and sin(3π/2) is -1. So plugging those in:cos(3π/2 - φ) = 0 * cos φ + (-1) * sin φ = -sin φ.So, cos(3π/2 - φ) = -sin φ. Therefore, from the problem, we have:-sin φ = 3/5.So, sin φ = -3/5. Okay, that's helpful. Now, I need to find tan φ, which is sin φ over cos φ. So, I have sin φ, but I need cos φ.Since I know sin φ, I can use the Pythagorean identity: sin² φ + cos² φ = 1.Plugging in sin φ = -3/5:(-3/5)² + cos² φ = 1So, 9/25 + cos² φ = 1Subtract 9/25 from both sides:cos² φ = 1 - 9/25 = 16/25Therefore, cos φ = ±4/5.Now, I need to determine whether cos φ is positive or negative. The problem states that |φ| < π/2, which means φ is between -π/2 and π/2. In this interval, cosine is always positive because cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, which cover this interval. So, cos φ = 4/5.Now, tan φ = sin φ / cos φ = (-3/5) / (4/5) = (-3/5) * (5/4) = -3/4.So, tan φ is -3/4, which corresponds to option C.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from cos(3π/2 - φ) = 3/5, I used the identity correctly to get -sin φ = 3/5, so sin φ = -3/5. Then, using the Pythagorean identity, I found cos φ = 4/5 because φ is in the range where cosine is positive. Then, tan φ is sin over cos, which is -3/4. That seems correct.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the unit circle or another identity? Let me think.Alternatively, I could consider the angle 3π/2 - φ. Since 3π/2 is 270 degrees, subtracting φ from it would place the angle in a specific quadrant. But since |φ| < π/2, which is 90 degrees, 3π/2 - φ would be between 3π/2 - π/2 = π and 3π/2 + π/2 = 2π. So, the angle 3π/2 - φ is in the fourth quadrant (between π and 2π). In the fourth quadrant, cosine is positive, which matches the given value of 3/5.But I already used the identity to find sin φ, so I think my initial approach was solid. Another way could be to represent this on the unit circle, but I think the identity method is straightforward.Just to recap:1. Start with cos(3π/2 - φ) = 3/5.2. Use the identity to find that this equals -sin φ.3. Therefore, sin φ = -3/5.4. Use Pythagorean identity to find cos φ = 4/5.5. Calculate tan φ = sin φ / cos φ = -3/4.Everything checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is C: -3/4."},{"question":"Using the same calculator with only [+1] and [x2] keys and starting with the display \\"1\\", what is the fewest number of keystrokes needed to reach \\"500\\"?textbf{(A)} 12qquadtextbf{(B)} 13qquadtextbf{(C)} 14qquadtextbf{(D)} 15qquadtextbf{(E)} 16","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the fewest number of keystrokes needed to get from 1 to 500 on a calculator that only has two buttons: [+1] and [x2]. Hmm, interesting. I remember seeing similar problems before where working backwards can be helpful. Maybe I should try that approach here too.Alright, let's start by thinking about what operations I can do. If I'm starting at 1, I can either add 1 or multiply by 2. But since I want to get to 500, which is a pretty big number, multiplying by 2 seems like it would get me there faster. But I also need to consider when adding 1 might be necessary, especially if I hit an odd number that can't be easily divided by 2.Wait, actually, maybe working backwards from 500 to 1 would be smarter. That way, I can decide whether to subtract 1 or divide by 2, which might make the path clearer. Let's try that.Starting at 500. Since 500 is even, I can divide by 2 to get 250. That's one operation. Now, 250 is also even, so dividing by 2 again gives me 125. That's two operations so far.Now, 125 is odd. Since I can't divide by 2 and get an integer, I need to subtract 1 to make it even. So, 125 minus 1 is 124. That's three operations. 124 is even, so dividing by 2 gives me 62. Four operations.62 is even, so divide by 2 to get 31. Five operations. 31 is odd, so subtract 1 to get 30. Six operations. 30 is even, divide by 2 to get 15. Seven operations.15 is odd, subtract 1 to get 14. Eight operations. 14 is even, divide by 2 to get 7. Nine operations. 7 is odd, subtract 1 to get 6. Ten operations.6 is even, divide by 2 to get 3. Eleven operations. 3 is odd, subtract 1 to get 2. Twelve operations. 2 is even, divide by 2 to get 1. Thirteen operations.So, working backwards, it took me 13 operations to get from 500 back to 1. That means it should take 13 operations to go from 1 to 500 using the forward operations of adding 1 and multiplying by 2.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss a shorter path. Sometimes, when working backwards, you might overlook a different route that could be shorter. For example, if I had added 1 at some point instead of subtracting, would that lead to a shorter path?Looking back at the steps:500 → 250 → 125 → 124 → 62 → 31 → 30 → 15 → 14 → 7 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 1Each step seems necessary because whenever I hit an odd number, subtracting 1 was the only way to make it even so I could divide by 2 again. If I had tried to add 1 at any point instead of subtracting, I would have ended up with a larger number, which would require more operations to reduce back down. So, I think this is indeed the optimal path.Just to be thorough, let me try constructing the path forward from 1 to 500 using the operations:1. Start at 1.2. Multiply by 2: 1 x 2 = 2.3. Multiply by 2: 2 x 2 = 4.4. Multiply by 2: 4 x 2 = 8.5. Multiply by 2: 8 x 2 = 16.6. Multiply by 2: 16 x 2 = 32.7. Multiply by 2: 32 x 2 = 64.8. Multiply by 2: 64 x 2 = 128.9. Multiply by 2: 128 x 2 = 256.10. Multiply by 2: 256 x 2 = 512. Oh, wait, that's too big. I overshot 500.Hmm, so instead of multiplying by 2 at step 10, maybe I should have added 1 somewhere earlier.

Still too big.This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I need to reconsider my approach. Working backwards seems to have given me a clear path, but trying to go forward is leading me to overshoot. Maybe I should stick with the backwards approach since it seems more reliable.So, going back to the backwards steps:500 → 250 → 125 → 124 → 62 → 31 → 30 → 15 → 14 → 7 → 6 → 3 → 2 → 1That's 13 operations. Each time I hit an odd number, I subtract 1 to make it even, then divide by 2. This seems to be the most efficient way because dividing by 2 reduces the number more quickly than subtracting 1 each time.Let me count the steps again to make sure:1. 500 ÷ 2 = 250 (1)2. 250 ÷ 2 = 125 (2)3. 125 - 1 = 124 (3)4. 124 ÷ 2 = 62 (4)5. 62 ÷ 2 = 31 (5)6. 31 - 1 = 30 (6)7. 30 ÷ 2 = 15 (7)8. 15 - 1 = 14 (8)9. 14 ÷ 2 = 7 (9)10. 7 - 1 = 6 (10)11. 6 ÷ 2 = 3 (11)12. 3 - 1 = 2 (12)13. 2 ÷ 2 = 1 (13)Yes, that's 13 operations. I think that's the minimum number of keystrokes needed. Trying to find a shorter path by adding 1 earlier doesn't seem to work because it leads to larger numbers that require more operations to reduce back down. So, working backwards and following the rule of dividing by 2 when even and subtracting 1 when odd gives the optimal solution.Therefore, the fewest number of keystrokes needed to reach 500 starting from 1 is 13."},{"question":"Given the set N={x mid frac{1}{2} < 2^{x+1} < 4, x in mathbb{Z}} and M={-1, 1}, find M cap N.","answer":"First, I need to understand the sets ( N ) and ( M ) that are given in the problem. Set ( N ) is defined as ( N = {x mid frac{1}{2} < 2^{x+1} < 4, x in mathbb{Z}} ). This means that ( N ) contains all integer values of ( x ) that satisfy the inequality ( frac{1}{2} < 2^{x+1} < 4 ).Set ( M ) is simply ( M = {-1, 1} ).My goal is to find the intersection of ( M ) and ( N ), which is ( M cap N ). This means I need to find the elements that are common to both sets ( M ) and ( N ).To do this, I'll start by solving the inequality ( frac{1}{2} < 2^{x+1} < 4 ) for integer values of ( x ).First, let's break down the inequality into two parts:1. ( frac{1}{2} < 2^{x+1} )2. ( 2^{x+1} < 4 )For the first part, ( frac{1}{2} < 2^{x+1} ):- I can rewrite ( frac{1}{2} ) as ( 2^{-1} ), so the inequality becomes ( 2^{-1} < 2^{x+1} ).- Since the base ( 2 ) is greater than ( 1 ), the inequality holds when the exponent on the left is less than the exponent on the right. Therefore, ( -1 < x + 1 ).- Subtracting ( 1 ) from both sides gives ( -2 < x ).For the second part, ( 2^{x+1} < 4 ):- I can rewrite ( 4 ) as ( 2^2 ), so the inequality becomes ( 2^{x+1} < 2^2 ).- Again, since the base ( 2 ) is greater than ( 1 ), the inequality holds when the exponent on the left is less than the exponent on the right. Therefore, ( x + 1 < 2 ).- Subtracting ( 1 ) from both sides gives ( x < 1 ).Combining both inequalities, we have ( -2 < x < 1 ). Since ( x ) must be an integer, the possible values of ( x ) are ( -1 ) and ( 0 ). Therefore, set ( N ) is ( N = {-1, 0} ).Now, to find ( M cap N ):- Set ( M = {-1, 1} )- Set ( N = {-1, 0} )The intersection ( M cap N ) contains elements that are present in both sets. The only common element is ( -1 ).Therefore, ( M cap N = {-1} )."},{"question":"A group of expressions arranged according to a rule: a^{2}, frac{{a}^{4}}{3}, frac{{a}^{6}}{5}, frac{{a}^{8}}{7}, ldots, then the 8th expression is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where there's a sequence of expressions: a squared, a to the fourth over three, a to the sixth over five, a to the eighth over seven, and so on. I need to figure out what the eighth expression in this sequence is. Hmm, let's see.First, I'll try to understand the pattern in the numerators and denominators separately. Looking at the numerators: a², a⁴, a⁶, a⁸... It seems like the exponent on 'a' is increasing by 2 each time. So, the first term has a², the second has a⁴, the third has a⁶, and so on. That makes me think that for the nth term, the exponent is 2n. So, if I want the eighth term, the exponent should be 2 times 8, which is 16. So, the numerator should be a¹⁶.Now, looking at the denominators: 1, 3, 5, 7... These are odd numbers increasing by 2 each time. The first term has 1, the second has 3, the third has 5, and so on. So, it looks like the denominator for the nth term is 2n minus 1. Let me check that: for n=1, 2(1)-1=1, which matches. For n=2, 2(2)-1=3, which also matches. For n=3, 2(3)-1=5, and so on. So, that seems to be the pattern.Therefore, for the eighth term, the denominator should be 2 times 8 minus 1, which is 16 minus 1, so 15. So, putting it all together, the eighth term should be a¹⁶ over 15.Wait, let me double-check that. If n=1: a²/1, n=2: a⁴/3, n=3: a⁶/5, n=4: a⁸/7, n=5: a¹⁰/9, n=6: a¹²/11, n=7: a¹⁴/13, and n=8: a¹⁶/15. Yeah, that seems consistent. Each time, the exponent increases by 2, and the denominator increases by 2 as well, starting from 1.So, I think I've got it. The eighth expression in the sequence is a¹⁶ divided by 15."},{"question":"Find the ordered pair (x,y) that satisfies the equations 3x - 18y = 2 and 4y - x = 5.","answer":"Okay, so I have these two equations to solve: 3x - 18y = 2 and 4y - x = 5. I need to find the ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies both. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from class that there are a couple of methods to solve systems of equations, like substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would work here because the coefficients look like they can be manipulated easily.First, let me write down the equations again to have them clear:1) 3x - 18y = 22) 4y - x = 5Looking at equation 2, it seems simpler because it has just a single x term. Maybe I can solve for x in terms of y and then substitute into equation 1. That sounds like substitution method. Let me try that.From equation 2: 4y - x = 5I can rearrange this to solve for x. Let's see:4y - x = 5Subtract 4y from both sides:-x = 5 - 4yMultiply both sides by -1 to solve for x:x = 4y - 5Okay, so x is equal to 4y - 5. Now, I can substitute this expression for x into equation 1. Let's do that.Equation 1: 3x - 18y = 2Substitute x with (4y - 5):3*(4y - 5) - 18y = 2Now, let's distribute the 3 into the parentheses:3*4y - 3*5 - 18y = 2Which simplifies to:12y - 15 - 18y = 2Combine like terms. 12y - 18y is -6y, so:-6y - 15 = 2Now, let's solve for y. First, add 15 to both sides:-6y = 2 + 15-6y = 17Now, divide both sides by -6:y = 17 / (-6)y = -17/6Okay, so y is -17/6. Now, I need to find x. I can use the expression I found earlier, x = 4y - 5, and plug in y = -17/6.x = 4*(-17/6) - 5Let me compute that step by step.First, 4*(-17/6) is:(4/1)*(-17/6) = (-68)/6Simplify that fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:-34/3So, x = -34/3 - 5Now, I need to subtract 5 from -34/3. To do this, I should express 5 as a fraction with denominator 3.5 = 15/3So, x = -34/3 - 15/3Combine the numerators:(-34 - 15)/3 = (-49)/3So, x = -49/3Therefore, the solution is x = -49/3 and y = -17/6.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with equation 2: 4y - x = 5Solved for x: x = 4y - 5Substituted into equation 1: 3*(4y -5) -18y = 2Which became 12y -15 -18y = 2Combined like terms: -6y -15 = 2Added 15: -6y = 17Divided by -6: y = -17/6Then, substituted y back into x = 4y -5:x = 4*(-17/6) -5 = -68/6 -5 = -34/3 -15/3 = -49/3Yes, that seems correct. Let me verify by plugging these values back into both original equations.First equation: 3x -18y = 2Plug in x = -49/3 and y = -17/6:3*(-49/3) -18*(-17/6) = ?3*(-49/3) is -49-18*(-17/6) is (18*17)/6 = (306)/6 = 51So, -49 + 51 = 2, which matches the right side of the equation. Good.Second equation: 4y -x =5Plug in y = -17/6 and x = -49/3:4*(-17/6) - (-49/3) = ?4*(-17/6) is -68/6 = -34/3Subtracting -49/3 is the same as adding 49/3.So, -34/3 + 49/3 = (15)/3 = 5, which matches the right side. Perfect.So, both equations are satisfied with x = -49/3 and y = -17/6.I think that's the correct solution. I didn't see any mistakes in my steps, and the verification confirms it. So, the ordered pair is (-49/3, -17/6).**Final Answer**The ordered pair that satisfies both equations is boxed{left( -dfrac{49}{3}, -dfrac{17}{6} right)}."},{"question":"The minimum value of the function y=2+4x+ frac {1}{x}(x > 0) is boxed{text{answer}}.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the function y = 2 + 4x + 1/x where x is greater than 0. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for functions like this, especially when dealing with variables in both linear and reciprocal terms, the AM-GM inequality might be useful. AM-GM stands for Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality, right?So, the function is y = 2 + 4x + 1/x. I notice that 4x and 1/x are the terms that involve x, while 2 is a constant. Maybe I can apply AM-GM to the variable terms. Let me recall the AM-GM inequality: for any non-negative real numbers a and b, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. That is, (a + b)/2 ≥ √(ab), with equality when a = b.But in this case, I have two terms: 4x and 1/x. Let me see if I can write them in a way that allows me to apply AM-GM. If I consider 4x and 1/x, their arithmetic mean would be (4x + 1/x)/2, and their geometric mean would be √(4x * 1/x). Let me compute that:√(4x * 1/x) = √4 = 2.So, according to AM-GM, (4x + 1/x)/2 ≥ 2. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 4x + 1/x ≥ 4. That means the sum of 4x and 1/x is at least 4. So, going back to the original function y = 2 + 4x + 1/x, since 4x + 1/x is at least 4, then y is at least 2 + 4 = 6. Therefore, the minimum value of y is 6.But wait, I should check when equality holds because that's when the minimum is achieved. For AM-GM, equality occurs when the two terms are equal. So, 4x must equal 1/x. Let me solve for x:4x = 1/x  Multiply both sides by x: 4x² = 1  Divide both sides by 4: x² = 1/4  Take square roots: x = ±1/2But since x > 0, we discard the negative solution. So, x = 1/2.Let me plug x = 1/2 back into the original function to verify:y = 2 + 4*(1/2) + 1/(1/2)  Simplify each term:  4*(1/2) = 2  1/(1/2) = 2  So, y = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.Yep, that checks out. So, the minimum value is indeed 6, achieved when x is 1/2.Alternatively, I could have used calculus to find the minimum. Let me try that method too for confirmation. If I take the derivative of y with respect to x and set it equal to zero, I should find the critical points.The function is y = 2 + 4x + 1/x. The derivative dy/dx is 4 - 1/x². Setting this equal to zero:4 - 1/x² = 0  1/x² = 4  x² = 1/4  x = ±1/2Again, since x > 0, x = 1/2. Then, the second derivative test can confirm if this is a minimum. The second derivative is 2/x³. Plugging in x = 1/2:2/(1/2)³ = 2/(1/8) = 16, which is positive, so it's a minimum.Therefore, both methods confirm that the minimum value is 6 at x = 1/2.I think that's thorough enough. I used two different methods to confirm the result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. It's always good to cross-verify using different techniques when possible.**Final Answer**The minimum value of the function is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Dana normally drinks a 500 ml bottle of soda each day.

Prove that when no more dominoes can be added to the grid, at least (frac{2}{3}) of the grid is covered by the dominoes.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about dominoes on an m x n grid. The goal is to prove that when you can't add any more dominoes, at least two-thirds of the grid is covered by dominoes. Hmm, dominoes cover two adjacent cells, right? So each domino covers two squares. First, I need to understand what it means when you can't add any more dominoes. That probably means every empty cell is isolated in some way—there's no adjacent empty cell next to it that it can form a domino with. So, the grid is in a state where all the empty cells are single and can't be paired with another empty cell. Let me think about how dominoes can be placed. They can be placed either horizontally or vertically. If the grid is completely filled with dominoes, obviously 100% is covered, but that's not the case here. We have some empty cells, but no more dominoes can be added. So, the empty cells must be arranged in such a way that they don't have a neighbor to pair with.Maybe I can model this as a graph where each cell is a vertex, and edges connect adjacent cells. Then, dominoes are like edges connecting two vertices. If no more dominoes can be added, that means the graph doesn't have any more edges that can be added without overlapping. So, the remaining graph is such that every vertex is either isolated or part of a structure that doesn't allow adding more edges.Wait, but dominoes are specific—they cover two adjacent cells, so in graph terms, they are edges. So, the problem reduces to finding a matching in the grid graph where no more edges can be added. The question is then about the density of such a matching.I remember that in bipartite graphs, which grid graphs are, the maximum matching can be found using various algorithms, but here we are not necessarily at maximum matching, but at a point where no more edges can be added. So, it's a maximal matching, not necessarily maximum.But how does that relate to the coverage? Each domino covers two cells, so the number of dominoes is D, and the number of covered cells is 2D. The total number of cells is mn, so the fraction covered is 2D/(mn). We need to show that 2D/(mn) >= 2/3, which simplifies to D >= (mn)/3.So, we need to show that in such a maximal matching, the number of dominoes D is at least mn/3.Hmm, but how do I approach this? Maybe I can think about the structure of the grid when no more dominoes can be added. Each empty cell must be isolated, meaning it has no adjacent empty cells. So, the empty cells are like singletons, each surrounded by dominoes or the grid boundary.If I can count the number of empty cells, B, then since each domino covers two cells, the number of dominoes D is (mn - B)/2. So, to show that 2D >= (2/3)mn, which is equivalent to D >= mn/3, substituting D gives (mn - B)/2 >= mn/3. Multiplying both sides by 2, mn - B >= 2mn/3, so -B >= -mn/3, which implies B <= mn/3.Therefore, if I can show that the number of empty cells B is at most mn/3, then the result follows. So, the problem reduces to showing that in such a maximal placement of dominoes, the number of empty cells is at most one-third of the grid.How can I show that B <= mn/3? Maybe by analyzing the arrangement of empty cells. Since each empty cell must be isolated, each one must be surrounded by dominoes. In a grid, each cell has up to four neighbors. If a cell is empty, all its neighbors must be covered by dominoes, but dominoes can cover two cells.Wait, but if an empty cell is in the middle, it has four neighbors, each of which must be part of a domino. Each domino can cover two cells, so each domino can potentially \\"cover\\" two empty cells? Wait, no, dominoes cover two cells, but if an empty cell is surrounded by dominoes, each domino adjacent to it can only cover one cell adjacent to the empty cell.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how many dominoes are required to isolate each empty cell. For each empty cell, all its adjacent cells must be covered by dominoes. Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino adjacent to an empty cell can only cover one cell adjacent to that empty cell.So, for each empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its adjacent cells. For example, if an empty cell is in the middle, it has four adjacent cells. Each domino can cover two of these, but each domino can only cover one cell adjacent to the empty cell because the other cell of the domino is adjacent to another cell.Wait, maybe not. Let's think about a specific example. Suppose we have an empty cell at position (i,j). Its four neighbors are (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1). Each of these must be covered by dominoes. Each domino can cover two adjacent cells, so for each neighbor, we can have a domino covering it and another cell.But dominoes can be placed either horizontally or vertically. So, for each empty cell, we need dominoes covering each of its four neighbors. However, each domino can cover two neighbors of the empty cell if placed appropriately.Wait, no. If the empty cell is at (i,j), a horizontal domino covering (i-1,j) and (i-1,j+1) would only cover one neighbor of the empty cell, which is (i-1,j). Similarly, a vertical domino covering (i-1,j) and (i,j) would cover (i-1,j) but that's adjacent to the empty cell. Wait, but the domino can't cover the empty cell because it's empty.So, each domino adjacent to the empty cell must cover one cell adjacent to the empty cell and another cell elsewhere. So, for each empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its four adjacent cells, but each domino can only cover one adjacent cell. Wait, that would require four dominoes, but that seems too much.Wait, maybe not. Let's think about an empty cell in the middle. It has four neighbors. Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino adjacent to the empty cell can only cover one of its neighbors because the other cell of the domino is not adjacent to the empty cell. So, for four neighbors, we need at least two dominoes, each covering two neighbors. But since each domino can only cover one neighbor of the empty cell, we need four dominoes? That seems conflicting.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it differently. Each empty cell requires that all its adjacent cells are covered by dominoes. Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino can only contribute to covering one adjacent cell of the empty cell. So, for each empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its four adjacent cells, because each domino can cover two cells, but each domino can only cover one cell adjacent to the empty cell.Wait, no. If an empty cell has four neighbors, each domino can cover two neighbors if placed appropriately. For example, a horizontal domino covering (i-1,j) and (i-1,j+1) would cover two neighbors of the empty cell (i,j). Similarly, a vertical domino covering (i,j-1) and (i+1,j-1) would cover two neighbors. So, actually, two dominoes can cover all four neighbors of the empty cell.Wait, but in reality, dominoes can't overlap, so if I place a horizontal domino above the empty cell, it covers (i-1,j) and (i-1,j+1). Then, a vertical domino to the left would cover (i,j-1) and (i+1,j-1). Similarly, a vertical domino to the right would cover (i,j+1) and (i+1,j+1). Wait, but that would require three dominoes, not two.Wait, maybe it's better to visualize. Let's say the empty cell is at (2,2). Then, its neighbors are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). To cover these, we can place a domino horizontally at (1,2)-(1,3), covering (1,2) and (1,3). Then, a domino vertically at (2,1)-(3,1), covering (2,1) and (3,1). Similarly, a domino vertically at (2,3)-(3,3), covering (2,3) and (3,3). And finally, a domino horizontally at (3,2)-(3,3), but wait, (3,3) is already covered. Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, place a domino horizontally at (1,2)-(1,3), covering (1,2) and (1,3). Then, a domino vertically at (2,1)-(3,1), covering (2,1) and (3,1). Then, a domino vertically at (2,3)-(3,3), covering (2,3) and (3,3). And finally, a domino horizontally at (3,2)-(3,3), but (3,3) is already covered. So, we need another domino for (3,2). Maybe a vertical domino at (3,2)-(4,2), but that's outside the grid if it's a 3x3 grid. Hmm, this is getting complicated.Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of trying to count dominoes per empty cell, perhaps I should consider the entire grid and the relationship between dominoes and empty cells.Let me define D as the number of dominoes, so 2D cells are covered. The number of empty cells is B = mn - 2D. We need to show that B <= mn/3, which is equivalent to D >= mn/3.So, how can I relate D and B? Maybe by considering the adjacency of empty cells. Since no two empty cells are adjacent, each empty cell must be surrounded by dominoes. This creates a kind of \\"buffer\\" around each empty cell.In graph theory terms, the empty cells form an independent set, meaning no two are adjacent. The dominoes cover the rest. So, the problem reduces to showing that in an independent set of a grid graph, the size of the independent set is at most one-third of the total vertices.Wait, is that a known result? For grid graphs, the maximum independent set is roughly half the grid, but here we have a stricter condition because each empty cell must be surrounded by dominoes, which are covering two cells each.Alternatively, maybe I can use a checkerboard coloring argument. If I color the grid in black and white in a checkerboard pattern, then each domino must cover one black and one white cell. So, the number of dominoes D is equal to the number of black cells covered, which is equal to the number of white cells covered.But if the grid has an even number of cells, then the number of black and white cells is equal. If it's odd, one color has one more cell. But in our case, since dominoes cover two cells, the total number of cells must be even for a perfect matching, but here we don't have a perfect matching, just a maximal one.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that m and n are even or odd, just that they are at least 2. So, maybe the checkerboard argument can help in some way.If I consider the number of black and white cells, let's say B_black and B_white are the number of empty cells on black and white squares. Since each domino covers one black and one white cell, the number of dominoes D is equal to the number of black cells covered, which is B_black_total - B_black, where B_black_total is the total number of black cells.Similarly, D = B_white_total - B_white. So, B_black_total - B_black = B_white_total - B_white. Therefore, B_black - B_white = B_black_total - B_white_total.But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I need another approach.Let me think about the boundary of the grid. If the grid is surrounded by a boundary, each domino placed on the edge can cover one cell inside and one on the boundary. But since the boundary is fixed, maybe the number of dominoes on the boundary relates to the number of empty cells.Wait, perhaps considering the perimeter of the grid. Each domino on the edge reduces the number of available cells for empty cells. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use induction. Suppose the statement is true for smaller grids, and then show it holds for larger grids. But I'm not sure how to set up the induction step.Wait, another idea: if no more dominoes can be added, then every empty cell is isolated, meaning it has no adjacent empty cells. So, the empty cells are like single points, each surrounded by dominoes. So, for each empty cell, there must be dominoes covering all four (or fewer, if on the edge) adjacent cells.Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino adjacent to an empty cell can only cover one cell adjacent to that empty cell. So, for each empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its adjacent cells. Wait, but if an empty cell is on the edge, it has fewer neighbors, so maybe fewer dominoes are needed.Wait, let's formalize this. For each empty cell, let's count the number of dominoes adjacent to it. If the empty cell is in the interior, it has four neighbors, each of which must be covered by a domino. Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino adjacent to the empty cell can only cover one of its neighbors because the other cell of the domino is not adjacent to the empty cell.Therefore, for each interior empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its four neighbors. Similarly, for an empty cell on the edge, it has three neighbors, so we need at least two dominoes to cover those three neighbors. For a corner empty cell, it has two neighbors, so we need at least one domino to cover those two neighbors.Wait, but if an empty cell is in the interior, it has four neighbors, each of which must be covered by dominoes. Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino adjacent to the empty cell can only cover one of its neighbors because the other cell of the domino is not adjacent to the empty cell. Therefore, for each interior empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its four neighbors.Similarly, for an edge empty cell (not a corner), it has three neighbors. Each domino can cover two cells, but each domino adjacent to the empty cell can only cover one of its neighbors. So, we need at least two dominoes to cover the three neighbors.For a corner empty cell, it has two neighbors. Each domino can cover two cells, so one domino can cover both neighbors.Therefore, in total, the number of dominoes D must satisfy:D >= 2 * (number of interior empty cells) + 2 * (number of edge empty cells) + 1 * (number of corner empty cells)But the total number of empty cells B is equal to the number of interior empty cells plus edge empty cells plus corner empty cells.Let me denote:Let B_int = number of interior empty cells,B_edge = number of edge empty cells (excluding corners),B_corner = number of corner empty cells.So, B = B_int + B_edge + B_corner.From above, D >= 2*B_int + 2*B_edge + 1*B_corner.But we also know that D = (mn - B)/2.So, substituting D:(mn - B)/2 >= 2*B_int + 2*B_edge + B_corner.But since B = B_int + B_edge + B_corner,Let me express B_int = B - B_edge - B_corner.Substituting:(mn - B)/2 >= 2*(B - B_edge - B_corner) + 2*B_edge + B_cornerSimplify the right-hand side:2B - 2B_edge - 2B_corner + 2B_edge + B_corner = 2B - B_cornerSo, we have:(mn - B)/2 >= 2B - B_cornerMultiply both sides by 2:mn - B >= 4B - 2B_cornerBring terms involving B to one side:mn >= 5B - 2B_cornerBut B_corner can be at most 4 (since there are four corners). So,mn >= 5B - 8Rearranging:5B <= mn + 8Therefore,B <= (mn + 8)/5But we need to show that B <= mn/3.So, is (mn + 8)/5 <= mn/3?Let's see:(mn + 8)/5 <= mn/3Multiply both sides by 15:3(mn + 8) <= 5mn3mn + 24 <= 5mn24 <= 2mnWhich is true since m,n >=2, so mn >=4, 2mn >=8, and 24 <= 2mn only if mn >=12. But for mn <12, this inequality doesn't hold. So, this approach might not be sufficient.Hmm, maybe my initial inequality was too loose. Let me go back.I had:D >= 2*B_int + 2*B_edge + B_cornerAnd D = (mn - B)/2So,(mn - B)/2 >= 2*(B - B_edge - B_corner) + 2*B_edge + B_cornerSimplify RHS:2B - 2B_edge - 2B_corner + 2B_edge + B_corner = 2B - B_cornerSo,(mn - B)/2 >= 2B - B_cornerMultiply both sides by 2:mn - B >= 4B - 2B_cornermn >= 5B - 2B_cornerSo,5B <= mn + 2B_cornerSince B_corner <=4,5B <= mn + 8Thus,B <= (mn +8)/5But we need B <= mn/3.So, (mn +8)/5 <= mn/3 ?As before, this is equivalent to 3(mn +8) <=5mn3mn +24 <=5mn24 <=2mnWhich is mn >=12.So, for grids where mn >=12, this gives B <= (mn +8)/5 <= mn/3 + 8/5.But 8/5 is about 1.6, which is less than mn/3 for mn >=12.Wait, but we need B <= mn/3.So, for mn >=12, (mn +8)/5 <= mn/3 + 8/5.But mn/3 +8/5 is greater than mn/3, so this doesn't directly give us B <= mn/3.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't tight enough. Perhaps I need a different way to bound B.Another idea: consider that each domino can \\"block\\" certain cells from being empty. Since each domino covers two cells, and each empty cell requires its neighbors to be covered, maybe there's a way to relate the number of dominoes to the number of empty cells more directly.Wait, let's think about the entire grid. Each domino covers two cells, and each empty cell requires its neighbors to be covered. So, for each empty cell, we need at least two dominoes to cover its neighbors. But each domino can cover neighbors for multiple empty cells.Wait, for example, a domino can be adjacent to two empty cells if it's placed between them. But in our case, since no two empty cells are adjacent, a domino can't be adjacent to two empty cells. Because if it were, those two empty cells would be adjacent through the domino, which is not allowed.Therefore, each domino can be adjacent to at most one empty cell. Because if it were adjacent to two, those two empty cells would be adjacent, which is not allowed.So, each domino can be adjacent to at most one empty cell. Therefore, the number of dominoes adjacent to empty cells is at least equal to the number of empty cells.But each domino can be adjacent to at most one empty cell, so the number of dominoes D' adjacent to empty cells satisfies D' >= B.But each domino is either adjacent to an empty cell or not. The dominoes not adjacent to any empty cell are completely surrounded by other dominoes. But in that case, those dominoes could potentially be moved or rearranged to cover more cells, but since the placement is maximal, maybe they can't.Wait, but in a maximal placement, every empty cell is isolated, so dominoes adjacent to empty cells are necessary, and dominoes not adjacent to any empty cells are in regions where they can't be expanded further.But perhaps the key is that each domino adjacent to an empty cell can only cover one empty cell's neighbor, so the number of dominoes adjacent to empty cells is at least B.But each domino can be adjacent to at most one empty cell, so D' >= B.But D' is the number of dominoes adjacent to empty cells, which is <= D, since all dominoes are either adjacent to empty cells or not.So, D >= D' >= B.Therefore, D >= B.But D = (mn - B)/2.So,(mn - B)/2 >= BMultiply both sides by 2:mn - B >= 2Bmn >= 3BThus,B <= mn/3Which is exactly what we needed to show!So, putting it all together:1. Each empty cell must be isolated, meaning all its neighbors are covered by dominoes.2. Each domino can be adjacent to at most one empty cell because two empty cells can't be adjacent.3. Therefore, the number of dominoes adjacent to empty cells D' must be at least equal to the number of empty cells B.4. Since each domino can be adjacent to at most one empty cell, D' <= D.5. Combining these, D >= D' >= B.6. But D = (mn - B)/2, so substituting:(mn - B)/2 >= B7. Solving this gives mn >= 3B, so B <= mn/3.8. Therefore, the number of empty cells is at most one-third of the grid, meaning the number of dominoes is at least two-thirds of the grid.So, the proof is complete."},{"question":"Juan needs to calculate the circumference of a circle for a project, but his measurement tool might cause an error of up to 10% when measuring the radius.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that both ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) are polynomials with real coefficients. The equation given is ( P(x)^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ). So, this means that ( x^2 + 1 ) divides ( P(x)^2 + 1 ). Since ( x^2 + 1 ) is an irreducible polynomial over the real numbers, it must divide ( P(x)^2 + 1 ) without any remainder.Let me think about the degrees of these polynomials. The degree of ( P(x)^2 ) would be ( 2d ), and the degree of ( (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ) would be ( 2 + 2 cdot text{deg}(Q) ). So, equating the degrees on both sides, we have ( 2d = 2 + 2 cdot text{deg}(Q) ). Simplifying this, we get ( d = 1 + text{deg}(Q) ). So, the degree of ( Q ) is ( d - 1 ).Wait, but this doesn't immediately tell me what ( d ) can be. Maybe I need to consider the roots of the equation. Since ( x^2 + 1 ) divides ( P(x)^2 + 1 ), the roots of ( x^2 + 1 ), which are ( x = i ) and ( x = -i ), must also be roots of ( P(x)^2 + 1 ). That means ( P(i)^2 + 1 = 0 ) and ( P(-i)^2 + 1 = 0 ).So, ( P(i)^2 = -1 ) and ( P(-i)^2 = -1 ). Let me write ( P(x) ) as a polynomial with real coefficients. Since the coefficients are real, ( P(-i) ) is the complex conjugate of ( P(i) ). So, if ( P(i) = a + bi ), then ( P(-i) = a - bi ). Then, ( P(i)^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi ). For this to equal ( -1 ), we must have ( a^2 - b^2 = -1 ) and ( 2ab = 0 ).So, ( 2ab = 0 ) implies either ( a = 0 ) or ( b = 0 ). If ( a = 0 ), then ( -b^2 = -1 ) which gives ( b^2 = 1 ), so ( b = pm 1 ). If ( b = 0 ), then ( a^2 = -1 ), which is impossible since ( a ) is real. Therefore, ( a = 0 ) and ( b = pm 1 ). So, ( P(i) = pm i ) and ( P(-i) = mp i ).Hmm, so ( P(x) ) evaluated at ( x = i ) is ( pm i ). Let me think about how ( P(x) ) can satisfy this. Maybe ( P(x) ) can be expressed in terms of ( x ) and ( x^2 + 1 ). Let me try to write ( P(x) ) as ( A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x ) for some polynomial ( A(x) ). Then, ( P(i) = A(i)(i^2 + 1) + i = A(i)(-1 + 1) + i = 0 + i = i ). Similarly, ( P(-i) = A(-i)((-i)^2 + 1) + (-i) = A(-i)(-1 + 1) - i = 0 - i = -i ). So, this satisfies the condition ( P(i) = i ) and ( P(-i) = -i ).Wait, but if I take ( P(x) = A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x ), then substituting back into the original equation:( P(x)^2 + 1 = [A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x]^2 + 1 ).Expanding this, we get:( [A(x)(x^2 + 1)]^2 + 2x A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x^2 + 1 ).So, that's ( A(x)^2 (x^2 + 1)^2 + 2x A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x^2 + 1 ).This should equal ( (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ). So, let's factor out ( x^2 + 1 ):( (x^2 + 1)[A(x)^2 (x^2 + 1) + 2x A(x)] + x^2 + 1 ).Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to factor ( x^2 + 1 ) from the entire expression. Let me try again:( [A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x]^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ).So, expanding the left side:( A(x)^2 (x^2 + 1)^2 + 2x A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x^2 + 1 ).So, we can write this as:( (x^2 + 1)[A(x)^2 (x^2 + 1) + 2x A(x)] + x^2 + 1 ).Hmm, but that doesn't directly factor out ( x^2 + 1 ) from the entire expression. Maybe I need to write it differently.Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation:( [A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x]^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ).So, moving ( (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ) to the left:( [A(x)(x^2 + 1) + x]^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 + 1 = 0 ).Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe instead, I can think of this as a Pell equation in polynomials. Pell equations usually have the form ( A^2 - N B^2 = 1 ), where ( N ) is a non-square integer. In this case, it's similar but with polynomials.So, if I let ( A(x) = P(x) ) and ( N = x^2 + 1 ), then the equation becomes ( P(x)^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 = -1 ). Wait, that's interesting because Pell equations usually have ( +1 ), but here it's ( -1 ). Maybe there's a connection.I recall that for Pell equations, solutions can be generated using continued fractions or recurrence relations. Maybe something similar applies here with polynomials. Let me see.If I think of ( x^2 + 1 ) as a quadratic polynomial, perhaps I can find a sequence of polynomials ( P_n(x) ) and ( Q_n(x) ) such that ( P_n(x)^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q_n(x)^2 = (-1)^n ). That might be a way to generate solutions.For example, starting with ( n = 1 ), we have ( P_1(x) = x ) and ( Q_1(x) = 1 ), since ( x^2 - (x^2 + 1)(1)^2 = -1 ). That works. Then, for ( n = 2 ), we might have ( P_2(x) = x^3 - 3x ) and ( Q_2(x) = x^2 - 2 ), because ( (x^3 - 3x)^2 - (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 2)^2 = 1 ). Let me check that:( (x^3 - 3x)^2 = x^6 - 6x^4 + 9x^2 ).( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 2)^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^4 - 4x^2 + 4) = x^6 - 4x^4 + 4x^2 + x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 = x^6 - 3x^4 + 0x^2 + 4 ).Subtracting these: ( (x^6 - 6x^4 + 9x^2) - (x^6 - 3x^4 + 4) = -3x^4 + 9x^2 - 4 ). Hmm, that doesn't equal 1. Maybe my guess is wrong.Wait, perhaps I need to use a different approach. Let me consider the equation ( P(x)^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ). If I rearrange it, I get ( P(x)^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 = -1 ). So, it's similar to a Pell equation but with a negative sign.In the integer Pell equation, solutions can be generated using the fundamental solution. Maybe here, we can generate solutions using a similar method. Let me see.Suppose I have a solution ( (P, Q) ). Then, maybe I can generate another solution by multiplying both sides by some expression. For example, in the integer case, if ( (a, b) ) is a solution, then ( (a + b sqrt{N})^n ) gives another solution. Maybe something similar applies here.Let me try to find a recurrence relation. Suppose I have ( P_{n+1} = P_n cdot x + Q_n cdot (x^2 + 1) ) and ( Q_{n+1} = P_n + Q_n cdot x ). Let me test this with ( n = 1 ):If ( P_1 = x ) and ( Q_1 = 1 ), then ( P_2 = x cdot x + 1 cdot (x^2 + 1) = x^2 + x^2 + 1 = 2x^2 + 1 ).( Q_2 = x + 1 cdot x = 2x ).Now, let's check if ( P_2^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q_2^2 ):( P_2^2 = (2x^2 + 1)^2 = 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 ).( (x^2 + 1) Q_2^2 = (x^2 + 1)(4x^2) = 4x^4 + 4x^2 ).So, ( P_2^2 + 1 = 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 + 1 = 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 2 ), which is not equal to ( 4x^4 + 4x^2 ). So, that doesn't work. Maybe my recurrence is wrong.Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different recurrence. Let me think about the minimal solution. We know that ( P_1 = x ) and ( Q_1 = 1 ) is a solution. Maybe the next solution can be found by multiplying ( (x + sqrt{x^2 + 1}) ) with itself. Let's see.In the integer Pell equation, the solutions are generated by ( (a + b sqrt{N})^n ). Maybe here, we can consider ( (x + sqrt{x^2 + 1})^n ) and expand it to get polynomials ( P_n ) and ( Q_n ).Let me compute ( (x + sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 ):( (x + sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 = x^2 + 2x sqrt{x^2 + 1} + (x^2 + 1) = 2x^2 + 1 + 2x sqrt{x^2 + 1} ).So, if I let ( P_2 = 2x^2 + 1 ) and ( Q_2 = 2x ), then ( P_2 + Q_2 sqrt{x^2 + 1} = (x + sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 ). But earlier, when I checked, ( P_2^2 + 1 ) didn't equal ( (x^2 + 1) Q_2^2 ). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.Let me recalculate ( P_2^2 + 1 ):( P_2 = 2x^2 + 1 ), so ( P_2^2 = (2x^2 + 1)^2 = 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 ).Adding 1: ( 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 2 ).Now, ( (x^2 + 1) Q_2^2 = (x^2 + 1)(4x^2) = 4x^4 + 4x^2 ).So, ( P_2^2 + 1 = 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 2 ), which is not equal to ( 4x^4 + 4x^2 ). Therefore, ( P_2 ) and ( Q_2 ) as defined don't satisfy the equation. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the recurrence.Alternatively, perhaps the solutions alternate between satisfying ( P_n^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q_n^2 = (-1)^n ). Let's check for ( n = 2 ):If ( P_2 = 2x^2 + 1 ) and ( Q_2 = 2x ), then ( P_2^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q_2^2 = (4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1) - (x^2 + 1)(4x^2) = 4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 - 4x^4 - 4x^2 = 1 ). So, ( P_2^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q_2^2 = 1 ). But our original equation is ( P(x)^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ), which is equivalent to ( P(x)^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 = -1 ). So, ( n = 2 ) gives us a solution to the equation with ( +1 ) instead of ( -1 ).So, maybe if we take ( n = 1 ), we get ( P_1^2 - (x^2 + 1) Q_1^2 = -1 ), which is our original equation. Then, ( n = 2 ) gives ( +1 ), ( n = 3 ) would give ( -1 ) again, and so on. So, perhaps the odd ( n ) give solutions to our original equation.Let me try ( n = 3 ). Using the same recurrence, ( P_3 = P_2 cdot x + Q_2 cdot (x^2 + 1) ) and ( Q_3 = P_2 + Q_2 cdot x ).So, ( P_3 = (2x^2 + 1) cdot x + (2x)(x^2 + 1) = 2x^3 + x + 2x^3 + 2x = 4x^3 + 3x ).( Q_3 = (2x^2 + 1) + (2x) cdot x = 2x^2 + 1 + 2x^2 = 4x^2 + 1 ).Now, let's check if ( P_3^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q_3^2 ):( P_3^2 = (4x^3 + 3x)^2 = 16x^6 + 24x^4 + 9x^2 ).Adding 1: ( 16x^6 + 24x^4 + 9x^2 + 1 ).Now, ( (x^2 + 1) Q_3^2 = (x^2 + 1)(4x^2 + 1)^2 ).First, compute ( (4x^2 + 1)^2 = 16x^4 + 8x^2 + 1 ).Then, multiply by ( x^2 + 1 ):( (x^2 + 1)(16x^4 + 8x^2 + 1) = 16x^6 + 8x^4 + x^2 + 16x^4 + 8x^2 + 1 = 16x^6 + 24x^4 + 9x^2 + 1 ).So, ( P_3^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q_3^2 ). Great, that works!So, it seems that for odd ( n ), we get solutions to our original equation. Specifically, ( n = 1 ) gives ( d = 1 ), ( n = 3 ) gives ( d = 3 ), and so on. Therefore, it appears that all odd positive integers ( d ) are possible.Wait, but how do I know that this process can continue indefinitely? Let me see. If I have a solution for ( n = k ), then I can generate a solution for ( n = k + 2 ) using the recurrence relation. So, starting from ( n = 1 ), I can generate ( n = 3, 5, 7, ldots ), each time increasing the degree by 2. Therefore, all odd degrees are achievable.But what about even degrees? Suppose someone claims that ( d = 2 ) is possible. Let me check. If ( d = 2 ), then ( P(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial. Let me assume ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). Then, ( P(x)^2 + 1 ) would be a quartic polynomial. On the other hand, ( (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ) would be a product of a quadratic and a square of a linear polynomial, making it a quartic as well. So, degrees match.Let me try to find such ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ). Let me set ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) and ( Q(x) = dx + e ). Then, the equation becomes:( (ax^2 + bx + c)^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1)(dx + e)^2 ).Expanding both sides:Left side: ( a^2x^4 + 2abx^3 + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2 + 1 ).Right side: ( (x^2 + 1)(d^2x^2 + 2dex + e^2) = d^2x^4 + 2dex^3 + (e^2 + d^2)x^2 + 2dex + e^2 ).Now, equate coefficients:1. ( x^4 ): ( a^2 = d^2 ) ⇒ ( a = pm d ).2. ( x^3 ): ( 2ab = 2de ) ⇒ ( ab = de ).3. ( x^2 ): ( 2ac + b^2 = e^2 + d^2 ).4. ( x ): ( 2bc = 2de ) ⇒ ( bc = de ).5. Constant term: ( c^2 + 1 = e^2 ).From equation 1, ( a = pm d ). Let's assume ( a = d ) first (we can consider ( a = -d ) later if needed).From equation 4: ( bc = de ). But from equation 2: ( ab = de ). Since ( a = d ), equation 2 becomes ( ab = a e ) ⇒ ( b = e ) (assuming ( a neq 0 )).From equation 4: ( bc = de ). But ( e = b ) and ( d = a ), so ( bc = a b ). If ( b neq 0 ), then ( c = a ). If ( b = 0 ), then from equation 2: ( 0 = de ), and from equation 4: ( 0 = de ). So, either ( d = 0 ) or ( e = 0 ). But ( d = a ), and if ( d = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ), which would make ( P(x) ) a linear polynomial, contradicting ( d = 2 ). So, ( e = 0 ). But then from equation 5: ( c^2 + 1 = 0 ), which is impossible since ( c ) is real. Therefore, ( b neq 0 ), so ( c = a ).Now, from equation 3: ( 2ac + b^2 = e^2 + d^2 ). Since ( c = a ), ( e = b ), and ( d = a ), this becomes:( 2a^2 + b^2 = b^2 + a^2 ) ⇒ ( 2a^2 = a^2 ) ⇒ ( a^2 = 0 ) ⇒ ( a = 0 ).But ( a = 0 ) would make ( P(x) ) a linear polynomial, which contradicts ( d = 2 ). Therefore, there is no solution for ( d = 2 ).Similarly, if we assume ( a = -d ), let's see:From equation 1: ( a = -d ).From equation 2: ( ab = de ). Since ( d = -a ), this becomes ( ab = (-a)e ) ⇒ ( ab = -ae ) ⇒ ( b = -e ) (assuming ( a neq 0 )).From equation 4: ( bc = de ). Since ( d = -a ) and ( e = -b ), this becomes ( bc = (-a)(-b) = ab ). So, ( bc = ab ). If ( b neq 0 ), then ( c = a ). If ( b = 0 ), then from equation 2: ( 0 = de ), and from equation 4: ( 0 = de ). So, either ( d = 0 ) or ( e = 0 ). But ( d = -a ), and if ( d = 0 ), then ( a = 0 ), which again contradicts ( d = 2 ). So, ( e = 0 ), but then from equation 5: ( c^2 + 1 = 0 ), which is impossible. Therefore, ( b neq 0 ), so ( c = a ).From equation 3: ( 2ac + b^2 = e^2 + d^2 ). Substituting ( c = a ), ( e = -b ), and ( d = -a ):( 2a^2 + b^2 = (-b)^2 + (-a)^2 = b^2 + a^2 ).Simplifying: ( 2a^2 + b^2 = b^2 + a^2 ) ⇒ ( 2a^2 = a^2 ) ⇒ ( a^2 = 0 ) ⇒ ( a = 0 ). Again, this contradicts ( d = 2 ).Therefore, there is no solution for ( d = 2 ). This suggests that even degrees might not be possible. Let me test ( d = 4 ) just to be sure.Assume ( d = 4 ). Then, ( P(x) ) is a quartic polynomial, and ( Q(x) ) would be a cubic polynomial since ( text{deg}(Q) = d - 1 = 3 ). Let me denote ( P(x) = a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e ) and ( Q(x) = f x^3 + g x^2 + h x + k ). The equation becomes:( (a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e)^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1)(f x^3 + g x^2 + h x + k)^2 ).This would result in a very long equation with many coefficients to match. It's quite tedious, but perhaps I can use a similar approach as before by considering the roots.We know that ( x^2 + 1 ) divides ( P(x)^2 + 1 ), so ( P(i)^2 = -1 ) and ( P(-i)^2 = -1 ). Let me compute ( P(i) ):( P(i) = a (i)^4 + b (i)^3 + c (i)^2 + d (i) + e = a (1) + b (-i) + c (-1) + d (i) + e = (a - c + e) + ( -b + d )i ).Similarly, ( P(-i) = a (-i)^4 + b (-i)^3 + c (-i)^2 + d (-i) + e = a (1) + b (i) + c (-1) + d (-i) + e = (a - c + e) + (b - d )i ).For ( P(i)^2 = -1 ), we have:( [(a - c + e) + ( -b + d )i]^2 = -1 ).Expanding this:( (a - c + e)^2 - ( -b + d )^2 + 2(a - c + e)( -b + d )i = -1 ).Since the right side is real, the imaginary part must be zero:( 2(a - c + e)( -b + d ) = 0 ).So, either ( a - c + e = 0 ) or ( -b + d = 0 ).Similarly, the real part must equal -1:( (a - c + e)^2 - ( -b + d )^2 = -1 ).Similarly, for ( P(-i)^2 = -1 ), we have:( [(a - c + e) + (b - d )i]^2 = -1 ).Expanding:( (a - c + e)^2 - (b - d )^2 + 2(a - c + e)(b - d )i = -1 ).Again, the imaginary part must be zero:( 2(a - c + e)(b - d ) = 0 ).And the real part must equal -1:( (a - c + e)^2 - (b - d )^2 = -1 ).So, from both conditions, we have:1. Either ( a - c + e = 0 ) or ( -b + d = 0 ) and ( b - d = 0 ).2. The real part equations.If ( a - c + e = 0 ), then from the real part equations:( 0 - ( -b + d )^2 = -1 ) ⇒ ( ( -b + d )^2 = 1 ).Similarly, ( 0 - (b - d )^2 = -1 ) ⇒ ( (b - d )^2 = 1 ).But ( ( -b + d )^2 = (b - d )^2 ), so both equal 1. Therefore, ( b - d = pm 1 ).So, if ( a - c + e = 0 ), then ( b - d = pm 1 ).Alternatively, if ( -b + d = 0 ) and ( b - d = 0 ), this implies ( b = d ). But then, from the real part equations:( (a - c + e)^2 - 0 = -1 ) ⇒ ( (a - c + e)^2 = -1 ), which is impossible since squares are non-negative.Therefore, the only possibility is ( a - c + e = 0 ) and ( b - d = pm 1 ).So, we have constraints on the coefficients of ( P(x) ). Now, let's see if we can find such a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree 4.But this is getting quite involved. Maybe instead of trying to find specific coefficients, I can argue that if ( d ) is even, then ( P(x) ) would have to satisfy certain symmetry or anti-symmetry properties, which might not be compatible with the equation ( P(x)^2 + 1 = (x^2 + 1) Q(x)^2 ).Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the solutions are generated by the recurrence relation for odd ( n ), and thus only odd degrees are possible. Since I couldn't find a solution for ( d = 2 ), and the process of generating solutions via the recurrence only gives odd degrees, it's likely that only odd ( d ) are possible.Therefore, putting it all together, the positive integers ( d ) for which such polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) exist are all odd positive integers."},{"question":"The table below shows Little Red's scores in a \\"Sunshine Sports\\" competition:| Event        | Running | Fancy Jump Rope | Jump Rope ||--------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|| Score        | 90    | 80            | 70      |When evaluating the total score, running accounts for 50%, fancy jump rope accounts for 30%, and jump rope accounts for 20%. What is Little Red's final score?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out Little Red's final score in this \\"Sunshine Sports\\" competition. Let me see... There's a table with three events: Running, Fancy Jump Rope, and Jump Rope. Each event has a score: Running is 90, Fancy Jump Rope is 80, and Jump Rope is 70. Now, the total score is calculated by weighting each event differently. Running accounts for 50%, Fancy Jump Rope for 30%, and Jump Rope for 20%. So, I guess I need to multiply each score by its respective percentage and then add them all up to get the final score.First, let's tackle Running. The score is 90, and it's worth 50% of the total. So, I need to find 50% of 90. To do that, I can convert 50% to a decimal, which is 0.5, and then multiply by 90. So, 90 times 0.5 equals... let's see, 90 divided by 2 is 45. Okay, so Running contributes 45 points to the total score.Next up is Fancy Jump Rope. The score here is 80, and it's worth 30% of the total. So, I need to find 30% of 80. Converting 30% to a decimal gives me 0.3. Multiplying 80 by 0.3, I get 24. So, Fancy Jump Rope adds 24 points to the total score.Now, Jump Rope has a score of 70 and accounts for 20% of the total. To find 20% of 70, I convert 20% to a decimal, which is 0.2, and multiply by 70. So, 70 times 0.2 equals 14. Therefore, Jump Rope contributes 14 points to the total score.Alright, now I have the contributions from each event: Running is 45, Fancy Jump Rope is 24, and Jump Rope is 14. To find the final score, I just need to add these three numbers together. So, 45 plus 24 is 69, and then adding 14 gives me 83.Wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 45 plus 24 is definitely 69, and then 69 plus 14 is 83. Yep, that seems right.So, putting it all together, Little Red's final score in the \\"Sunshine Sports\\" competition is 83 points."},{"question":"Let (mathbf{X}) and (mathbf{Y}) be matrices such that[ mathbf{X} + mathbf{Y} = mathbf{X} mathbf{Y}. ]If (mathbf{X} mathbf{Y} = begin{pmatrix} 16/3 & 2  -10/3 & 10/3 end{pmatrix},) find (mathbf{Y} mathbf{X}.)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given two matrices, X and Y, and they satisfy the equation X + Y = XY. Additionally, I know that the product XY is equal to a specific matrix:XY = [16/3   2]     [-10/3 10/3]And I need to find the product YX. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in matrix multiplication, the product isn't necessarily commutative, so XY doesn't have to equal YX. But maybe there's a relationship here because of the equation X + Y = XY.Let me write down the given equation:X + Y = XY.So, rearranging that, I get:XY - X - Y = 0.Hmm, that looks a bit like something I can factor. Maybe I can add the identity matrix to both sides to make it factorable. Let me try that:XY - X - Y + I = I.Now, this looks similar to the form (X - I)(Y - I) = I, right? Because if I expand (X - I)(Y - I), I get XY - X - Y + I. So, yeah, that works out.So, (X - I)(Y - I) = I.That means that (X - I) and (Y - I) are inverses of each other. So, (Y - I) is the inverse of (X - I), and vice versa. Therefore, we can say that:(Y - I)(X - I) = I.Let me expand this product:YX - Y - X + I = I.So, simplifying that, we get:YX - Y - X + I = I.Subtracting I from both sides:YX - Y - X = 0.Which means:YX = X + Y.But from the original equation, we know that X + Y = XY. So, substituting that in:YX = XY.Wait, that means YX is equal to XY? But XY is given as [16/3   2; -10/3 10/3]. So, does that mean YX is also equal to that same matrix?Hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from X + Y = XY.Then, I added I to both sides after rearranging, getting (X - I)(Y - I) = I.Which implies that (Y - I)(X - I) = I as well, since inverses are unique.Expanding that gives YX - Y - X + I = I, which simplifies to YX = X + Y.But since X + Y = XY, substituting gives YX = XY.So, YX equals XY, which is given. Therefore, YX is equal to [16/3   2; -10/3 10/3].But wait, is this always the case? If (X - I)(Y - I) = I, then (Y - I)(X - I) = I, so YX = X + Y, which is equal to XY. So, in this specific case, YX equals XY.But I thought matrix multiplication isn't commutative. Maybe in this particular case, because of the equation they satisfy, they commute.Let me test this with some numbers to see if this makes sense.Suppose X and Y are 1x1 matrices, which are just scalars. Let’s say X + Y = XY. Then, rearranged, we get XY - X - Y = 0, which can be written as (X - 1)(Y - 1) = 1. So, (X - 1) and (Y - 1) are reciprocals. Then, YX would be equal to XY, because scalar multiplication is commutative. So, in this case, YX = XY.But for matrices, it's not necessarily commutative, but in this specific case, because of the equation, they do commute. So, YX = XY.Therefore, the answer should be the same as XY, which is given.Wait, but let me think again. If (X - I)(Y - I) = I, then (Y - I)(X - I) = I as well, because the inverse of (X - I) is (Y - I). So, when we multiply them in either order, we get the identity. So, that would imply that YX = X + Y, which is equal to XY.So, yeah, I think that's correct. Therefore, YX is equal to XY, which is given as [16/3   2; -10/3 10/3].But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could go. Suppose I didn't use the factoring trick. Maybe I can express Y in terms of X or vice versa.From X + Y = XY, I can solve for Y:Y = XY - X.So, Y = X(Y - I).Hmm, but that might not be helpful directly. Alternatively, I can write:Y = (X + Y) - X = XY - X.Wait, that's the same as before. Maybe I can factor out X:Y = X(Y - I).But unless I know something about X or Y, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, maybe I can solve for Y in terms of X.From X + Y = XY, rearranged:XY - Y = X.So, Y(X - I) = X.Therefore, Y = X(X - I)^{-1}.Assuming that (X - I) is invertible, which it is because (X - I)(Y - I) = I, so (X - I) is invertible.Similarly, from (X - I)(Y - I) = I, we have Y - I = (X - I)^{-1}, so Y = (X - I)^{-1} + I.But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since we know that YX = X + Y, and X + Y = XY, so YX = XY.Therefore, YX is equal to XY, which is given.So, I think that's the answer. YX equals the same matrix as XY.But just to make sure, let me try to compute YX directly, assuming that YX = XY.Given that XY is [16/3   2; -10/3 10/3], then YX should also be the same.Alternatively, maybe I can compute YX using the relation YX = X + Y.But since X + Y = XY, which is given, then YX = XY.Therefore, YX is equal to the given XY matrix.So, I think the answer is that YX is equal to [16/3   2; -10/3 10/3].Wait, but let me think again. If YX = XY, then they commute, but is that necessarily the case here?From the equation (X - I)(Y - I) = I, we have that (Y - I)(X - I) = I as well, which implies that YX - Y - X + I = I, so YX = X + Y.But X + Y = XY, so YX = XY.Therefore, yes, YX equals XY.So, the answer is the same matrix as XY.Therefore, YX is [16/3   2; -10/3 10/3].I think that's correct."},{"question":"The parabola y=4-x^{2} intersects with the line y=4x at two points, A and B. Point P moves on the parabola from A to B. When the area of triangle PAB is maximized, the coordinates of point P are (quad).A: (-3,-5)B: (-2,0)C: (-1,3)D: (0,4)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a parabola intersects with a line at two points, A and B. Point P moves along the parabola from A to B, and I need to find the coordinates of P when the area of triangle PAB is maximized. The options are given as A: (-3,-5), B: (-2,0), C: (-1,3), D: (0,4).First, I should probably sketch the graphs of the parabola and the line to visualize where points A and B are. The parabola is y = 4 - x², which is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0,4). The line is y = 4x, which is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 4.To find the points of intersection A and B, I need to solve the equations y = 4 - x² and y = 4x simultaneously. So, set them equal:4 - x² = 4xBring all terms to one side:x² + 4x - 4 = 0Wait, that's not right. Let me rearrange the equation properly.Starting from 4 - x² = 4x, subtract 4x from both sides:4 - x² - 4x = 0Which simplifies to:-x² - 4x + 4 = 0Multiply both sides by -1 to make it standard:x² + 4x - 4 = 0Now, this is a quadratic equation. I can solve it using the quadratic formula:x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -4.So,x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 - 4*1*(-4))]/2x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 16)]/2x = [-4 ± sqrt(32)]/2sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2), so:x = [-4 ± 4sqrt(2)]/2Simplify numerator:x = [-4/2 ± (4sqrt(2))/2]x = -2 ± 2sqrt(2)So, the x-coordinates of points A and B are -2 + 2sqrt(2) and -2 - 2sqrt(2). Let me calculate approximate values to get a sense of where these points are.sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so 2sqrt(2) is about 2.828.Therefore,x1 ≈ -2 + 2.828 ≈ 0.828x2 ≈ -2 - 2.828 ≈ -4.828So, points A and B are approximately at (0.828, y1) and (-4.828, y2). Let me find the y-coordinates.For x ≈ 0.828, y = 4x ≈ 4*0.828 ≈ 3.313For x ≈ -4.828, y = 4x ≈ 4*(-4.828) ≈ -19.313Wait, that seems quite low for the parabola. Let me check if I did the calculations correctly.Wait, actually, the parabola is y = 4 - x². So, for x ≈ -4.828, y = 4 - (-4.828)² ≈ 4 - 23.313 ≈ -19.313. So that's correct.But maybe I should keep the exact values instead of approximate decimals.So, points A and B have coordinates:A: ( -2 + 2sqrt(2), 4*(-2 + 2sqrt(2)) ) = ( -2 + 2sqrt(2), -8 + 8sqrt(2) )B: ( -2 - 2sqrt(2), 4*(-2 - 2sqrt(2)) ) = ( -2 - 2sqrt(2), -8 - 8sqrt(2) )Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can just denote them as A and B without exact coordinates for now.Now, point P moves along the parabola from A to B. I need to find the point P where the area of triangle PAB is maximized.I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:Area = (1/2) * base * heightIn this case, the base can be considered as the distance between points A and B, and the height would be the perpendicular distance from point P to the line AB.Wait, but line AB is the same as the line y = 4x, right? Because points A and B lie on both the parabola and the line y = 4x.So, the line AB is y = 4x. Therefore, the area of triangle PAB can be expressed as (1/2) * |AB| * d, where d is the perpendicular distance from point P to the line AB.Therefore, to maximize the area, we need to maximize the distance d from point P to the line AB.Since |AB| is fixed (as A and B are fixed points), the area is maximized when d is maximized.So, the problem reduces to finding the point P on the parabola y = 4 - x² such that the perpendicular distance from P to the line y = 4x is maximized.I remember that the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is given by:d = |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²)First, let me write the line AB in standard form. The line is y = 4x, which can be rewritten as 4x - y = 0.So, a = 4, b = -1, c = 0.Therefore, the distance from point P(x, y) to the line AB is:d = |4x - y| / sqrt(4² + (-1)²) = |4x - y| / sqrt(16 + 1) = |4x - y| / sqrt(17)Since y = 4 - x² for point P on the parabola, substitute y:d = |4x - (4 - x²)| / sqrt(17) = |4x - 4 + x²| / sqrt(17) = |x² + 4x - 4| / sqrt(17)So, to maximize d, we need to maximize |x² + 4x - 4|.Since sqrt(17) is a positive constant, maximizing |x² + 4x - 4| will maximize d.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of |x² + 4x - 4| for x between the x-coordinates of A and B.Wait, but points A and B are the intersection points, so x ranges from -2 - 2sqrt(2) to -2 + 2sqrt(2). So, the domain of x is from approximately -4.828 to 0.828.But actually, since P moves from A to B along the parabola, x goes from -2 - 2sqrt(2) to -2 + 2sqrt(2). So, the interval is from x = -2 - 2sqrt(2) to x = -2 + 2sqrt(2).But since we're dealing with the absolute value function |x² + 4x - 4|, we need to analyze its behavior in this interval.First, let's consider the function f(x) = x² + 4x - 4.We can analyze where this function is positive or negative.The roots of f(x) are the solutions to x² + 4x - 4 = 0, which we already found earlier: x = -2 ± 2sqrt(2). So, in the interval between x = -2 - 2sqrt(2) and x = -2 + 2sqrt(2), f(x) is negative because the parabola opens upwards and the roots are at the endpoints.Therefore, |f(x)| = |x² + 4x - 4| = -(x² + 4x - 4) = -x² - 4x + 4 in this interval.So, we need to maximize the function g(x) = -x² - 4x + 4 over the interval x ∈ [-2 - 2sqrt(2), -2 + 2sqrt(2)].This is a quadratic function opening downwards (since the coefficient of x² is negative). Therefore, its maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of a quadratic function ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a).Here, a = -1, b = -4.So, x = -(-4)/(2*(-1)) = 4 / (-2) = -2.So, the maximum of g(x) occurs at x = -2.Therefore, the maximum distance d occurs at x = -2.Now, let's find the corresponding y-coordinate on the parabola.y = 4 - x² = 4 - (-2)^2 = 4 - 4 = 0.So, the point P is (-2, 0).Looking at the options, that's option B.Wait, let me double-check.We found that the maximum distance occurs at x = -2, which is within the interval between A and B, since -2 is between -4.828 and 0.828.Therefore, the point P is (-2, 0), which is option B.Alternatively, another approach is to realize that the maximum distance from the line AB occurs where the tangent to the parabola is parallel to AB.Since AB has a slope of 4, the tangent at point P should also have a slope of 4.The derivative of the parabola y = 4 - x² is dy/dx = -2x.Set this equal to 4:-2x = 4 => x = -2.Then, y = 4 - (-2)^2 = 0.So, P is (-2, 0), which is option B.Yes, that confirms the earlier result.Therefore, the correct answer is option B: (-2, 0)."},{"question":"Compute (p^2 + q^2 + r^2,) given that (p, q,) and (r) are the roots of the polynomial[3x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0.]","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compute ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ) given that ( p, q, ) and ( r ) are the roots of the polynomial ( 3x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 ). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with polynomials and their roots, Vieta's formulas are really useful. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a cubic polynomial, I should be able to use Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation.The general form of a cubic polynomial is ( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 ), and for such a polynomial, the sums and products of its roots ( p, q, r ) are given by:- ( p + q + r = -frac{b}{a} )- ( pq + pr + qr = frac{c}{a} )- ( pqr = -frac{d}{a} )In this problem, the polynomial is ( 3x^3 - 7x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 ). So, comparing this to the general form, I can identify the coefficients:- ( a = 3 )- ( b = -7 )- ( c = 2 )- ( d = -4 )Now, applying Vieta's formulas:1. The sum of the roots ( p + q + r = -frac{b}{a} = -frac{-7}{3} = frac{7}{3} ).2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time ( pq + pr + qr = frac{c}{a} = frac{2}{3} ).3. The product of the roots ( pqr = -frac{d}{a} = -frac{-4}{3} = frac{4}{3} ).Okay, so I have these three pieces of information:- ( p + q + r = frac{7}{3} )- ( pq + pr + qr = frac{2}{3} )- ( pqr = frac{4}{3} )But what I need is ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ). Hmm, how can I relate this to the information I have? I recall that there's a formula that connects the sum of the squares of the roots to the sum of the roots and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time.The formula is:[ (p + q + r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + pr + qr) ]This looks promising because I have both ( p + q + r ) and ( pq + pr + qr ). Let me plug in the values I have into this formula.First, compute ( (p + q + r)^2 ):[ left( frac{7}{3} right)^2 = frac{49}{9} ]Next, compute ( 2(pq + pr + qr) ):[ 2 times frac{2}{3} = frac{4}{3} ]Now, substituting these into the equation:[ frac{49}{9} = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + frac{4}{3} ]I need to solve for ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ). So, I'll subtract ( frac{4}{3} ) from both sides of the equation:[ p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = frac{49}{9} - frac{4}{3} ]Wait, to subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 9 and 3, so I can convert ( frac{4}{3} ) to ninths:[ frac{4}{3} = frac{12}{9} ]Now, subtract:[ p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = frac{49}{9} - frac{12}{9} = frac{37}{9} ]So, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = frac{37}{9} ). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Identified the coefficients correctly: ( a = 3 ), ( b = -7 ), ( c = 2 ), ( d = -4 ).2. Applied Vieta's formulas correctly:   - Sum of roots: ( frac{7}{3} )   - Sum of products: ( frac{2}{3} )   - Product of roots: ( frac{4}{3} )3. Used the identity ( (p + q + r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + pr + qr) ).4. Plugged in the values correctly:   - ( left( frac{7}{3} right)^2 = frac{49}{9} )   - ( 2 times frac{2}{3} = frac{4}{3} )5. Subtracted ( frac{4}{3} ) from ( frac{49}{9} ) after converting to a common denominator:   - ( frac{49}{9} - frac{12}{9} = frac{37}{9} )Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning. So, I'm confident that the sum of the squares of the roots is ( frac{37}{9} ).**Final Answer**The value of ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ) is boxed{dfrac{37}{9}}."},{"question":"Given that x > 0, y > 0, and x + 2y = 1, find the minimum value of frac{y}{x} + frac{1}{y}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that x is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x plus 2y equals 1, I need to find the minimum value of the expression y over x plus 1 over y. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that x and y are positive numbers, which is good because it means I don't have to worry about negative values messing things up. The equation x + 2y = 1 is a constraint that relates x and y. So, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other to substitute into the expression I need to minimize.Let me solve the equation x + 2y = 1 for x. If I subtract 2y from both sides, I get x = 1 - 2y. Since x has to be positive, that means 1 - 2y > 0, so 2y < 1, which implies y < 1/2. So, y has to be between 0 and 1/2.Now, I can substitute x = 1 - 2y into the expression y/x + 1/y. Let's do that:y/x + 1/y = y/(1 - 2y) + 1/y.Hmm, so now I have an expression in terms of y only. Maybe I can find the minimum value by taking the derivative with respect to y and setting it equal to zero. That sounds like calculus, which I remember is a method for finding maxima and minima.Let me denote the function as f(y) = y/(1 - 2y) + 1/y. I need to find f'(y) and set it to zero.First, let's compute the derivative of y/(1 - 2y). Using the quotient rule: if I have a function u/v, its derivative is (u'v - uv')/v². So, here, u = y, so u' = 1, and v = 1 - 2y, so v' = -2.So, the derivative of y/(1 - 2y) is [1*(1 - 2y) - y*(-2)] / (1 - 2y)². Simplifying the numerator: 1 - 2y + 2y = 1. So, the derivative is 1 / (1 - 2y)².Next, the derivative of 1/y is -1/y².So, putting it all together, f'(y) = 1/(1 - 2y)² - 1/y².To find the critical points, set f'(y) = 0:1/(1 - 2y)² - 1/y² = 0.So, 1/(1 - 2y)² = 1/y².Taking reciprocals on both sides, (1 - 2y)² = y².Taking square roots, |1 - 2y| = |y|. Since y is positive and less than 1/2, 1 - 2y is positive, so we can drop the absolute value:1 - 2y = y.Solving for y: 1 = 3y, so y = 1/3.Now, let's check if this is a minimum. Since we're dealing with a function that's defined on an interval (0, 1/2), and we found a critical point at y = 1/3, we can test the second derivative or check the behavior around y = 1/3.Alternatively, since the function f(y) tends to infinity as y approaches 0 and as y approaches 1/2, the critical point at y = 1/3 is likely to be a minimum.So, plugging y = 1/3 back into the expression for x: x = 1 - 2*(1/3) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.So, x = 1/3 and y = 1/3.Now, let's compute the expression y/x + 1/y with these values:y/x = (1/3)/(1/3) = 1.1/y = 1/(1/3) = 3.So, 1 + 3 = 4.Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is 4.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Expressed x in terms of y: x = 1 - 2y. That seems correct.2. Substituted into the expression: y/(1 - 2y) + 1/y. That looks right.3. Took the derivative: f'(y) = 1/(1 - 2y)² - 1/y². Let me verify the derivative:- For y/(1 - 2y), using quotient rule: [1*(1 - 2y) - y*(-2)] / (1 - 2y)² = [1 - 2y + 2y]/(1 - 2y)² = 1/(1 - 2y)². Correct.- For 1/y, derivative is -1/y². Correct.4. Set derivative equal to zero: 1/(1 - 2y)² = 1/y². Then, (1 - 2y)² = y². Expanding both sides: 1 - 4y + 4y² = y². So, 1 - 4y + 3y² = 0.Wait, hold on, earlier I said 1 - 2y = y, but actually, expanding (1 - 2y)² gives 1 - 4y + 4y², and setting that equal to y² gives 1 - 4y + 4y² = y², which simplifies to 1 - 4y + 3y² = 0.So, solving 3y² - 4y + 1 = 0.Using quadratic formula: y = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 12)] / 6 = [4 ± 2]/6.So, y = (4 + 2)/6 = 1 or y = (4 - 2)/6 = 1/3.But y must be less than 1/2, so y = 1 is invalid. Therefore, y = 1/3 is the only solution. So, that part was correct.Then, x = 1 - 2*(1/3) = 1/3. Correct.Then, plugging back into the expression: y/x + 1/y = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.So, all steps seem to check out. Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 4.Alternatively, I remember that sometimes using the AM-GM inequality can help in such optimization problems. Let me see if I can approach it that way.Given x + 2y = 1, and we need to minimize y/x + 1/y.Let me denote a = y/x and b = 1/y. Then, the expression is a + b.But I need to relate a and b through the constraint x + 2y = 1.Expressing x in terms of y: x = 1 - 2y.So, a = y/(1 - 2y).And b = 1/y.So, the expression is y/(1 - 2y) + 1/y.Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can manipulate the expression differently.Alternatively, let's consider the expression y/x + 1/y.Let me write it as y/x + 1/y = (y^2 + x)/xy.But since x + 2y = 1, x = 1 - 2y, so substituting:(y^2 + (1 - 2y))/y(1 - 2y) = (y^2 + 1 - 2y)/(y(1 - 2y)).Not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, let's consider variables substitution.Let me set t = y. Then, x = 1 - 2t.So, the expression becomes t/(1 - 2t) + 1/t.Which is the same as before. So, maybe calculus is the way to go, which we already did.Alternatively, maybe using substitution to make it a function of a single variable and then apply AM-GM.Wait, let me think differently.Let me consider the expression y/x + 1/y.Let me write it as y/x + 1/y = y/x + (x + 2y)/y.Because x + 2y = 1, so 1/y = (x + 2y)/y = x/y + 2.So, substituting back, y/x + 1/y = y/x + x/y + 2.Ah, that's interesting. So, the expression becomes y/x + x/y + 2.Now, y/x + x/y is a familiar form. By AM-GM inequality, y/x + x/y ≥ 2*sqrt((y/x)*(x/y)) = 2*sqrt(1) = 2.So, y/x + x/y ≥ 2, with equality when y/x = x/y, which implies x = y.So, the expression y/x + x/y + 2 ≥ 2 + 2 = 4.Therefore, the minimum value is 4, achieved when x = y.But wait, from the constraint x + 2y = 1, if x = y, then x + 2x = 1, so 3x = 1, x = 1/3, and y = 1/3.So, that's consistent with our earlier result.Therefore, using the AM-GM inequality, we can directly find that the minimum value is 4.So, both methods, calculus and AM-GM, lead us to the same conclusion.I think that solidifies the answer. So, the minimum value is indeed 4."},{"question":"Solve[arcsin (sin x) = frac{x}{2}.]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.","answer":"Alright, so I have this equation to solve: arcsin(sin x) equals x over 2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the arcsine function, or inverse sine function, has a specific range. It only outputs values between -π/2 and π/2. So, whatever is inside the arcsine, which is sin x in this case, has to be within that range. But wait, sin x itself is always between -1 and 1, so that part is fine. But the output of arcsin(sin x) will be between -π/2 and π/2. That means the right side of the equation, x/2, must also lie within this interval.So, if x/2 is between -π/2 and π/2, then x must be between -π and π. Okay, that gives me a domain to work within: x is between -π and π.Now, let's think about the equation itself: arcsin(sin x) = x/2. I know that arcsin(sin x) essentially gives me the angle y in the range [-π/2, π/2] such that sin y = sin x. So, y is equal to x if x is already in [-π/2, π/2], but if x is outside this range, y will be the reference angle in [-π/2, π/2] that has the same sine value as x.So, arcsin(sin x) is equal to x if x is between -π/2 and π/2. If x is between π/2 and 3π/2, arcsin(sin x) would be π - x, but wait, since we're only considering x up to π, maybe it's different.Wait, actually, for x in [π/2, 3π/2], arcsin(sin x) is π - x, but since our domain is limited to x between -π and π, let's see:- For x in [-π/2, π/2], arcsin(sin x) = x.- For x in [π/2, 3π/2], arcsin(sin x) = π - x.- For x in [-3π/2, -π/2], arcsin(sin x) = -π - x.But since our domain is x between -π and π, let's adjust accordingly:- For x in [-π/2, π/2], arcsin(sin x) = x.- For x in [π/2, π], arcsin(sin x) = π - x.- For x in [-π, -π/2], arcsin(sin x) = -π - x.Okay, so now I can break down the equation into different cases based on these intervals.**Case 1: x is in [-π/2, π/2]**In this interval, arcsin(sin x) = x. So, the equation becomes:x = x/2Subtract x/2 from both sides:x - x/2 = 0x/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2:x = 0So, x = 0 is a solution in this interval.**Case 2: x is in [π/2, π]**Here, arcsin(sin x) = π - x. So, the equation becomes:π - x = x/2Let's solve for x:π = x/2 + xπ = (3x)/2Multiply both sides by 2:2π = 3xDivide both sides by 3:x = (2π)/3Now, check if this solution is within the interval [π/2, π]. Since π/2 is approximately 1.57 and (2π)/3 is approximately 2.09, which is less than π (approximately 3.14). So, yes, x = (2π)/3 is a valid solution in this interval.**Case 3: x is in [-π, -π/2]**In this interval, arcsin(sin x) = -π - x. So, the equation becomes:-π - x = x/2Let's solve for x:-π = x/2 + x-π = (3x)/2Multiply both sides by 2:-2π = 3xDivide both sides by 3:x = (-2π)/3Now, check if this solution is within the interval [-π, -π/2]. Since -π is approximately -3.14 and -π/2 is approximately -1.57, (-2π)/3 is approximately -2.09, which is between -π and -π/2. So, x = (-2π)/3 is a valid solution in this interval.**Summary of Solutions:**From the three cases, we have found three solutions:1. x = 02. x = (2π)/33. x = (-2π)/3Let me just verify these solutions to make sure they satisfy the original equation.**Verification:**1. For x = 0:arcsin(sin 0) = arcsin(0) = 0Right side: 0/2 = 0So, 0 = 0, which is true.2. For x = (2π)/3:arcsin(sin (2π)/3) = arcsin(√3/2) = π/3Right side: (2π)/3 / 2 = π/3So, π/3 = π/3, which is true.3. For x = (-2π)/3:arcsin(sin (-2π)/3) = arcsin(-√3/2) = -π/3Right side: (-2π)/3 / 2 = -π/3So, -π/3 = -π/3, which is true.All three solutions satisfy the original equation, so they are all valid.**Final Answer**The solutions are boxed{-dfrac{2pi}{3}}, boxed{0}, and boxed{dfrac{2pi}{3}}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=Asin(omega x+varphi) (A>0, omega>0, 0<varphi<frac{π}{2}), the following four propositions are given:<br/>A: The distance between the adjacent two symmetry axes of the graph of this function is frac{π}{2};<br/>B: The graph of this function can be obtained by shifting the graph of y=cos2x-sqrt{3}sin2x to the right by frac{π}{4} units;<br/>C: The function is monotonically increasing on the interval (-frac{π}{12},frac{π}{6});<br/>D: The function satisfies f(frac{π}{3}+x)+f(frac{π}{3}-x)=0.<br/>If only one proposition is false, then the proposition is ( ).A: AB: BC: CD: D","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a function f(x) = A sin(ωx + φ), where A is positive, ω is positive, and φ is between 0 and π/2. There are four propositions given, and I need to figure out which one is false, knowing that only one is false.Let me go through each proposition one by one.**Proposition A**: The distance between the adjacent two symmetry axes of the graph of this function is π/2.Hmm, symmetry axes for a sine function... I remember that the sine function has symmetry axes at its peaks and troughs. For a standard sine function, like sin(x), the distance between symmetry axes would be half the period. The period of sin(x) is 2π, so half the period is π. But in this case, the function is f(x) = A sin(ωx + φ). The period of this function is 2π/ω. So half the period would be π/ω. Proposition A says this distance is π/2. So, π/ω = π/2, which implies ω = 2. So, if the period is π, then the distance between symmetry axes is π/2. That seems correct if ω is 2. But I don't know ω yet, so I'll keep that in mind.**Proposition B**: The graph of this function can be obtained by shifting the graph of y = cos(2x) - √3 sin(2x) to the right by π/4 units.Alright, let's see. The given function is y = cos(2x) - √3 sin(2x). I think I can rewrite this as a single sine or cosine function using the amplitude-phase form. Let me recall that a cosθ + b sinθ can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = √(a² + b²) and tanφ = b/a.So, for y = cos(2x) - √3 sin(2x), a = 1 and b = -√3. So, R = √(1 + 3) = √4 = 2. Then, tanφ = b/a = (-√3)/1 = -√3. So φ = arctan(-√3). Since φ is negative, it's equivalent to 2π/3 in the positive direction because tan(2π/3) = tan(-π/3) = -√3. Wait, actually, arctan(-√3) is -π/3, but since we're dealing with angles, we can represent it as 2π/3 if we're considering the positive angle.So, y = 2 cos(2x + π/3). Wait, is that right? Let me check. If I have R cos(θ - φ), then it's R cosθ cosφ + R sinθ sinφ. Comparing to the original equation, which is cos(2x) - √3 sin(2x), so that would be R cosφ = 1 and R sinφ = -√3. So, R = 2, cosφ = 1/2, sinφ = -√3/2. So φ is in the fourth quadrant, which is -π/3 or 5π/3. But since we usually take φ between 0 and 2π, it would be 5π/3. But in the problem statement, φ is between 0 and π/2, so maybe this isn't directly applicable.Wait, the proposition says that shifting y = cos(2x) - √3 sin(2x) to the right by π/4 units gives the graph of f(x). So, let's shift y = 2 cos(2x + π/3) to the right by π/4. To shift a function right by π/4, we replace x with x - π/4. So, y = 2 cos[2(x - π/4) + π/3] = 2 cos(2x - π/2 + π/3) = 2 cos(2x - π/6).But f(x) is given as A sin(ωx + φ). So, can 2 cos(2x - π/6) be written as A sin(ωx + φ)? Yes, because cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2). So, 2 cos(2x - π/6) = 2 sin(2x - π/6 + π/2) = 2 sin(2x + π/3). So, f(x) would be 2 sin(2x + π/3). So, A = 2, ω = 2, φ = π/3. Since φ is π/3, which is between 0 and π/2, that's okay. So, this seems correct. So, proposition B is true.**Proposition C**: The function is monotonically increasing on the interval (-π/12, π/6).Okay, so f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3). To find where it's increasing, we can take the derivative. The derivative f'(x) = 2 * 2 cos(2x + π/3) = 4 cos(2x + π/3). The function is increasing when the derivative is positive, so when cos(2x + π/3) > 0.Let's solve for x in (-π/12, π/6):First, let's find 2x + π/3 when x is in (-π/12, π/6):When x = -π/12: 2*(-π/12) + π/3 = -π/6 + π/3 = π/6.When x = π/6: 2*(π/6) + π/3 = π/3 + π/3 = 2π/3.So, 2x + π/3 ranges from π/6 to 2π/3.Now, cos(θ) is positive when θ is in (-π/2 + 2πk, π/2 + 2πk) for integers k. So, in the interval π/6 to 2π/3, cos(θ) is positive from π/6 to π/2, and negative from π/2 to 2π/3.So, cos(2x + π/3) is positive when 2x + π/3 < π/2, which is when 2x < π/2 - π/3 = π/6, so x < π/12.Similarly, cos(2x + π/3) is negative when x > π/12.So, in the interval (-π/12, π/6), the derivative is positive from x = -π/12 up to x = π/12, and negative from x = π/12 to x = π/6.Therefore, the function is increasing on (-π/12, π/12) and decreasing on (π/12, π/6). So, it's not monotonically increasing on the entire interval (-π/12, π/6). Therefore, proposition C is false.But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the derivative.f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3), so f'(x) = 4 cos(2x + π/3). Yes, that's correct.And solving for cos(2x + π/3) > 0:2x + π/3 ∈ (-π/2 + 2πk, π/2 + 2πk).So, solving for x:-π/2 < 2x + π/3 < π/2Subtract π/3:-π/2 - π/3 < 2x < π/2 - π/3Which is:-5π/6 < 2x < π/6Divide by 2:-5π/12 < x < π/12So, the function is increasing on (-5π/12, π/12) and decreasing elsewhere within the period.But the interval given in proposition C is (-π/12, π/6). So, within this interval, from -π/12 to π/12, it's increasing, and from π/12 to π/6, it's decreasing. Therefore, the function is not monotonically increasing on the entire interval (-π/12, π/6). So, proposition C is indeed false.**Proposition D**: The function satisfies f(π/3 + x) + f(π/3 - x) = 0.Let's check this. f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/3). So, f(π/3 + x) = 2 sin[2(π/3 + x) + π/3] = 2 sin(2π/3 + 2x + π/3) = 2 sin(π + 2x) = 2 sin(π + 2x). Sin(π + θ) = -sinθ, so this is -2 sin(2x).Similarly, f(π/3 - x) = 2 sin[2(π/3 - x) + π/3] = 2 sin(2π/3 - 2x + π/3) = 2 sin(π - 2x). Sin(π - θ) = sinθ, so this is 2 sin(2x).Therefore, f(π/3 + x) + f(π/3 - x) = -2 sin(2x) + 2 sin(2x) = 0. So, proposition D is true.So, summarizing:- Proposition A: True (if ω=2, which seems to be the case from proposition B)- Proposition B: True- Proposition C: False- Proposition D: TrueTherefore, the only false proposition is C."},{"question":"Given lines l_1: 2x+y+1=0 and l_2: 4x+2y-1=0, find the distance between l_1 and l_2 (    ).A: frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}B: frac{3sqrt{5}}{10}C: frac{sqrt{5}}{5}D: 2","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the distance between two lines, l₁ and l₂. The equations given are:l₁: 2x + y + 1 = 0l₂: 4x + 2y - 1 = 0Hmm, okay. I remember that to find the distance between two lines, they need to be parallel. If they're not parallel, they'll intersect at some point, and the distance between them isn't really defined because they get infinitely close. So first, I should check if these lines are parallel.To check if they're parallel, I can see if their slopes are equal. To find the slope, I can rewrite each equation in slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope.Starting with l₁: 2x + y + 1 = 0Let me solve for y:y = -2x - 1So the slope (m₁) is -2.Now for l₂: 4x + 2y - 1 = 0Solving for y:2y = -4x + 1y = -2x + 0.5So the slope (m₂) is also -2.Great, both lines have the same slope, which means they are indeed parallel. Now, since they are parallel, I can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.I recall the formula for the distance between two parallel lines Ax + By + C₁ = 0 and Ax + By + C₂ = 0 is:d = |C₁ - C₂| / sqrt(A² + B²)But wait, let me make sure I have the equations in the same form. Right now, l₁ is 2x + y + 1 = 0, and l₂ is 4x + 2y - 1 = 0. They don't look identical in coefficients for x and y. Maybe I should make them have the same coefficients to apply the formula directly.Looking at l₁: 2x + y + 1 = 0If I multiply the entire equation by 2, I get:4x + 2y + 2 = 0Now, l₁ becomes 4x + 2y + 2 = 0, and l₂ is 4x + 2y - 1 = 0.Perfect, now both equations have the same coefficients for x and y, which is what I needed.So now, I can apply the distance formula. Let me identify A, B, C₁, and C₂.From l₁: 4x + 2y + 2 = 0, so A = 4, B = 2, C₁ = 2From l₂: 4x + 2y - 1 = 0, so A = 4, B = 2, C₂ = -1Plugging these into the distance formula:d = |C₁ - C₂| / sqrt(A² + B²)d = |2 - (-1)| / sqrt(4² + 2²)d = |2 + 1| / sqrt(16 + 4)d = |3| / sqrt(20)d = 3 / sqrt(20)Hmm, sqrt(20) can be simplified. sqrt(20) is sqrt(4*5), which is 2*sqrt(5). So:d = 3 / (2*sqrt(5))To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5):d = (3*sqrt(5)) / (2*5)d = (3*sqrt(5)) / 10So the distance between the two lines is 3*sqrt(5)/10.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Converted both lines to slope-intercept form to confirm they are parallel. Both slopes were -2, so that's correct.2. Adjusted l₁ by multiplying by 2 to make the coefficients of x and y the same as in l₂. That gave me 4x + 2y + 2 = 0 for l₁ and 4x + 2y - 1 = 0 for l₂.3. Applied the distance formula: |C₁ - C₂| / sqrt(A² + B²). Plugged in C₁ = 2 and C₂ = -1, so |2 - (-1)| = 3.4. Calculated sqrt(4² + 2²) = sqrt(16 + 4) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5).5. Divided 3 by 2*sqrt(5) and rationalized the denominator to get 3*sqrt(5)/10.Everything seems to check out.

Prove that ( prod_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 + frac{1}{a_{n}}right) = e ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a sequence defined by ( a_1 = 1 ) and for ( n geq 2 ), ( a_n = n(a_{n-1} + 1) ). I need to prove that the infinite product ( prod_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 + frac{1}{a_n}right) ) equals ( e ). Hmm, interesting. I remember that ( e ) can be expressed as a limit involving factorials or exponentials, so maybe there's a connection here.First, let me try to understand the sequence ( a_n ). Starting with ( a_1 = 1 ), then:- ( a_2 = 2(a_1 + 1) = 2(1 + 1) = 4 )- ( a_3 = 3(a_2 + 1) = 3(4 + 1) = 15 )- ( a_4 = 4(a_3 + 1) = 4(15 + 1) = 64 )- ( a_5 = 5(a_4 + 1) = 5(64 + 1) = 325 )Wait, so the sequence is growing pretty fast. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for ( a_n ). Maybe I can write it recursively or find a relation that can be simplified.Given ( a_n = n(a_{n-1} + 1) ), let's rearrange it:( a_n = n a_{n-1} + n )This looks similar to a recurrence relation that can be solved using generating functions or perhaps by recognizing it as a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me see if I can manipulate it into a telescoping product or something.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( 1 + frac{1}{a_n} ) in terms of ( a_{n+1} ) or something else. Let's try that.Given ( a_{n+1} = (n+1)(a_n + 1) ), so ( a_n + 1 = frac{a_{n+1}}{n+1} ). Therefore, ( 1 + frac{1}{a_n} = frac{a_n + 1}{a_n} = frac{a_{n+1}}{(n+1)a_n} ).Ah, that seems useful. So each term in the product can be written as ( frac{a_{n+1}}{(n+1)a_n} ). Therefore, the product ( prod_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 + frac{1}{a_n}right) ) becomes ( prod_{n=1}^{infty} frac{a_{n+1}}{(n+1)a_n} ).Let me write out the first few terms of this product to see if it telescopes:- For ( n = 1 ): ( frac{a_2}{2 a_1} )- For ( n = 2 ): ( frac{a_3}{3 a_2} )- For ( n = 3 ): ( frac{a_4}{4 a_3} )- And so on...So when we multiply these together, most terms should cancel out. Let's see:( frac{a_2}{2 a_1} times frac{a_3}{3 a_2} times frac{a_4}{4 a_3} times cdots )Each ( a_n ) in the numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term. So after cancellation, we're left with ( frac{a_{N+1}}{(N+1)! a_1} ) for the partial product up to ( N ).Since ( a_1 = 1 ), this simplifies to ( frac{a_{N+1}}{(N+1)!} ). So the partial product ( P_N = prod_{n=1}^{N} left(1 + frac{1}{a_n}right) = frac{a_{N+1}}{(N+1)!} ).Now, if I can find an expression for ( a_{N+1} ), maybe I can relate it to factorials or something that can lead me to ( e ).Looking back at the recurrence relation ( a_n = n a_{n-1} + n ), let's try to solve it explicitly. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.The homogeneous part is ( a_n - n a_{n-1} = 0 ). The characteristic equation isn't straightforward here because the coefficients are variable (they depend on ( n )). Maybe another approach is better.Alternatively, let's write the recurrence as:( a_n = n a_{n-1} + n )Divide both sides by ( n! ):( frac{a_n}{n!} = frac{a_{n-1}}{(n-1)!} + frac{1}{(n-1)!} )Let me define ( b_n = frac{a_n}{n!} ). Then the recurrence becomes:( b_n = b_{n-1} + frac{1}{(n-1)!} )This is a much simpler recurrence! Now, we can write ( b_n ) as a sum:( b_n = b_1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{k!} )Since ( b_1 = frac{a_1}{1!} = 1 ), we have:( b_n = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{k!} )Therefore, ( a_n = n! times b_n = n! left(1 + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{k!}right) )So, ( a_{N+1} = (N+1)! left(1 + sum_{k=1}^{N} frac{1}{k!}right) )Plugging this back into the partial product ( P_N = frac{a_{N+1}}{(N+1)!} ), we get:( P_N = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{N} frac{1}{k!} )That's interesting! So the partial product ( P_N ) is equal to the sum ( 1 + sum_{k=1}^{N} frac{1}{k!} ). But wait, that sum is the partial sum of the series expansion of ( e ). Recall that ( e = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{1}{k!} ), so ( 1 + sum_{k=1}^{N} frac{1}{k!} = sum_{k=0}^{N} frac{1}{k!} ).Therefore, as ( N ) approaches infinity, ( P_N ) approaches ( e ). So the infinite product ( prod_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 + frac{1}{a_n}right) ) converges to ( e ).Wait, let me double-check this. If ( P_N = sum_{k=0}^{N} frac{1}{k!} ), then as ( N to infty ), ( P_N to e ). That makes sense because the exponential function's series converges to ( e ). So yes, the infinite product equals ( e ).I think that wraps it up. By expressing the product as a telescoping product, simplifying it to a partial sum of the exponential series, and then taking the limit, we've shown that the product converges to ( e )."},{"question":"A tetrahedron (ABCD) is divided into two parts by a plane parallel to (AB) and (CD). It is known that the ratio of the distance from (AB) to this plane to the distance from (CD) to the plane is (k). Find the ratio of the volumes of the two parts of the tetrahedron.","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a tetrahedron being divided by a plane parallel to two of its edges, AB and CD. The ratio of the distances from AB to the plane and from CD to the plane is given as k, and I need to find the ratio of the volumes of the two parts created by this plane.First, let me visualize the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, the edges AB and CD are skew lines because they don't intersect and aren't parallel. The plane that's cutting the tetrahedron is parallel to both AB and CD, so it must intersect the tetrahedron in such a way that the intersection is a quadrilateral, right? Because it's parallel to two edges, the intersection should create a four-sided figure.Let me denote the plane as α. This plane α will intersect the other edges of the tetrahedron, which are AC, AD, BC, and BD. So, the intersection points will be on these edges. Let me call the intersection points E, F, G, and H on edges AC, AD, BC, and BD respectively. So, the quadrilateral EFGH is formed by the intersection of plane α with the tetrahedron.Now, since plane α is parallel to both AB and CD, the lines EF and GH must be parallel to AB and CD. Similarly, FG and HE must be parallel to the other edges. Wait, no, actually, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the lines of intersection should be parallel to both AB and CD. Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully about this.Wait, if the plane is parallel to AB and CD, then the intersection lines on the faces of the tetrahedron should be parallel to AB and CD. So, on face ABC, the intersection line should be parallel to AB, and on face ACD, the intersection line should be parallel to CD. Similarly, on the other faces, the intersection lines should be parallel to AB and CD.Let me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron to make this more concrete. Maybe that will help me visualize it better. Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0), point B at (1, 0, 0), point C at (0, 1, 0), and point D at (0, 0, 1). So, AB is from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), CD is from (0,1,0) to (0,0,1). Now, the plane α is parallel to AB and CD. Since AB is along the x-axis and CD is along the line from (0,1,0) to (0,0,1), which is along the negative y and positive z direction.Wait, but a plane can't be parallel to two skew lines unless it's parallel to both directions. So, the plane α must be parallel to both the direction vector of AB, which is (1,0,0), and the direction vector of CD, which is (0,-1,1). So, the normal vector of the plane α must be perpendicular to both (1,0,0) and (0,-1,1). Let me compute the normal vector.The normal vector n can be found by taking the cross product of the direction vectors of AB and CD. So, n = AB × CD = (1,0,0) × (0,-1,1) = (0*1 - 0*(-1), 0*0 - 1*1, 1*(-1) - 0*0) = (0, -1, -1). So, the normal vector is (0, -1, -1), which simplifies to (0,1,1) when considering direction.So, the equation of plane α can be written as 0(x - x0) + 1(y - y0) + 1(z - z0) = 0. But since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, it doesn't necessarily pass through any specific point unless we fix it. However, the distance from AB to α and from CD to α is given in the ratio k. So, I need to find the specific plane α that divides the tetrahedron such that the ratio of these distances is k.Wait, maybe instead of coordinates, I should think about similar tetrahedrons. Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the portion of the tetrahedron above the plane (closer to AB) will be similar to the original tetrahedron, and the portion below the plane (closer to CD) will also be similar but scaled differently.Let me denote the distance from AB to the plane α as d1 and the distance from CD to the plane α as d2. Given that d1/d2 = k. So, d1 = k*d2. The total distance between AB and CD is d1 + d2 = k*d2 + d2 = (k + 1)d2. Therefore, d2 = (d1 + d2)/(k + 1) = total distance/(k + 1). Similarly, d1 = k/(k + 1)*total distance.But wait, in a tetrahedron, the distance between two skew lines AB and CD isn't straightforward. Maybe I need to compute the distance between AB and CD in my coordinate system.In my coordinate system, AB is from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), and CD is from (0,1,0) to (0,0,1). The distance between two skew lines can be calculated using the formula:Distance = |(C - A) ⋅ (n)| / |n|,where n is the cross product of the direction vectors of AB and CD.Wait, earlier I found n = (0,1,1). So, let's compute |(C - A) ⋅ n| / |n|.Point C is (0,1,0), so vector C - A is (0,1,0). The dot product with n = (0,1,1) is 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*1 = 1. The magnitude of n is sqrt(0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So, the distance between AB and CD is |1| / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2).So, the total distance between AB and CD is 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, d1 = k/(k + 1)*1/sqrt(2) and d2 = 1/(k + 1)*1/sqrt(2).But how does this help me find the volumes? Maybe I need to find the scaling factor of the similar tetrahedrons.Since the plane α is parallel to AB and CD, the portion of the tetrahedron above α (closer to AB) is similar to the original tetrahedron, scaled down by some factor. Similarly, the portion below α (closer to CD) is also similar but scaled differently.Wait, actually, the portion closer to AB is a smaller tetrahedron, and the portion closer to CD is a frustum-like shape, but since it's a tetrahedron, it's actually a truncated tetrahedron, which is a frustum.But in this case, since the plane is parallel to two edges, the resulting cross-section is a quadrilateral, so the upper part is a smaller tetrahedron, and the lower part is a kind of prismatoid.Wait, maybe I need to think about the ratio of the heights. If the plane is at a distance d1 from AB and d2 from CD, with d1/d2 = k, then the scaling factor for the upper tetrahedron would be proportional to d1, and the scaling factor for the lower part would be proportional to d2.But in a tetrahedron, the volume scales with the cube of the linear dimensions. So, if the upper part is scaled by a factor of s, its volume would be s^3 times the original volume. Similarly, the lower part would be scaled by (1 - s)^3? Wait, not exactly, because the lower part isn't a similar tetrahedron, it's a frustum.Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the heights. Let me consider the height of the tetrahedron along the line connecting AB and CD. The total height is 1/sqrt(2), as computed earlier. The plane α divides this height into d1 and d2, with d1 = k*d2.So, the height from AB to α is k*d2, and from α to CD is d2. Therefore, total height is (k + 1)d2 = 1/sqrt(2), so d2 = 1/(sqrt(2)(k + 1)).Now, the upper part, closer to AB, has a height of d1 = k/(sqrt(2)(k + 1)). The lower part has a height of d2 = 1/(sqrt(2)(k + 1)).But how does this relate to the volumes? Since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the cross-sectional area at any height is proportional to the square of the distance from AB or CD. Wait, no, actually, in a tetrahedron, the cross-sectional area parallel to a face scales with the square of the distance from that face.But in this case, the plane is parallel to two edges, not a face. So, maybe the scaling is different.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of similar tetrahedrons. If I consider the upper part, it's a smaller tetrahedron similar to the original one, scaled by a factor s. Similarly, the lower part is the original tetrahedron minus this smaller one.But wait, the plane is not parallel to a face, it's parallel to two edges. So, the upper part isn't a tetrahedron, it's a kind of prism with a quadrilateral base. Hmm, this is getting complicated.Maybe I should use coordinates to find the exact points where the plane intersects the edges, then compute the volumes using coordinates.Let me go back to my coordinate system:A = (0,0,0)B = (1,0,0)C = (0,1,0)D = (0,0,1)Plane α is parallel to AB and CD, which have direction vectors (1,0,0) and (0,-1,1). The normal vector of α is (0,1,1), as computed earlier.Let me denote the equation of plane α as y + z = c, where c is a constant. Since it's parallel to AB and CD, it doesn't intersect them, so c must be between the values of y + z on AB and CD.On AB, points are (x,0,0), so y + z = 0. On CD, points are (0,1 - t, t) for t in [0,1], so y + z = (1 - t) + t = 1. Therefore, c must be between 0 and 1.So, the plane α is y + z = c, where 0 < c < 1.Now, I need to find the intersection points of this plane with the edges AC, AD, BC, and BD.Edge AC goes from A(0,0,0) to C(0,1,0). Parametric equation: (0, t, 0), t ∈ [0,1]. Plugging into plane equation: t + 0 = c ⇒ t = c. So, intersection point E is (0, c, 0).Edge AD goes from A(0,0,0) to D(0,0,1). Parametric equation: (0,0,t), t ∈ [0,1]. Plugging into plane equation: 0 + t = c ⇒ t = c. So, intersection point F is (0,0,c).Edge BC goes from B(1,0,0) to C(0,1,0). Parametric equation: (1 - t, t, 0), t ∈ [0,1]. Plugging into plane equation: t + 0 = c ⇒ t = c. So, intersection point G is (1 - c, c, 0).Edge BD goes from B(1,0,0) to D(0,0,1). Parametric equation: (1 - t, 0, t), t ∈ [0,1]. Plugging into plane equation: 0 + t = c ⇒ t = c. So, intersection point H is (1 - c, 0, c).So, the quadrilateral EFGH has vertices at E(0,c,0), F(0,0,c), G(1 - c, c, 0), and H(1 - c, 0, c).Now, I need to compute the volumes of the two parts: the upper part (closer to AB) and the lower part (closer to CD).The upper part is bounded by AB, the plane α, and the original faces. The lower part is bounded by CD, the plane α, and the original faces.To compute the volumes, maybe I can use the coordinates of the intersection points and apply the formula for the volume of a polyhedron.Alternatively, since the plane is y + z = c, and the original tetrahedron has vertices at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), I can compute the volume above the plane and below the plane.Wait, actually, the original tetrahedron can be divided into two parts by the plane y + z = c. The part where y + z ≤ c is the lower part, closer to AB, and the part where y + z ≥ c is the upper part, closer to CD.Wait, no, actually, since AB is at y + z = 0 and CD is at y + z = 1, the plane y + z = c divides the tetrahedron into two parts: one where y + z ≤ c (closer to AB) and one where y + z ≥ c (closer to CD).So, the volume closer to AB is the region y + z ≤ c, and the volume closer to CD is y + z ≥ c.To find these volumes, I can set up integrals or use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron cut by a plane.Alternatively, since the plane is y + z = c, the intersection with the tetrahedron is the quadrilateral EFGH, as found earlier. So, the upper part (closer to CD) is a polyhedron with vertices C, D, G, H, E, F. Wait, no, actually, the upper part would be bounded by the original vertices C, D and the intersection points G, H, E, F.Wait, maybe it's better to compute the volume of the lower part (closer to AB) and subtract it from the total volume to get the upper part.The total volume of the tetrahedron is 1/6, since it's a unit tetrahedron.So, let's compute the volume of the lower part, which is the region y + z ≤ c.To compute this volume, I can set up a triple integral over the region y + z ≤ c within the tetrahedron.The tetrahedron is defined by x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0, and x + y + z ≤ 1.But since the plane is y + z = c, the region y + z ≤ c within the tetrahedron is a smaller tetrahedron?Wait, no, because y + z ≤ c intersects the original tetrahedron, which is bounded by x + y + z ≤ 1.So, the intersection is a polyhedron with vertices at A(0,0,0), E(0,c,0), F(0,0,c), and G(1 - c, c, 0), H(1 - c, 0, c). Wait, actually, the lower part is a polyhedron with vertices A, E, F, G, H.Wait, maybe it's a pentahedron, but actually, since it's bounded by the plane y + z = c and the original faces, it's a kind of truncated tetrahedron.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron cut by a plane. The volume can be found by integrating over the region y + z ≤ c within the original tetrahedron.Let me set up the integral.The original tetrahedron is defined by x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0, and x + y + z ≤ 1.The region y + z ≤ c within this tetrahedron is a subset.So, the volume V_lower is the integral over x from 0 to 1 - y - z, y from 0 to c - z, z from 0 to c.Wait, no, let me think carefully.Actually, for a given z, y can go from 0 to c - z, and x can go from 0 to 1 - y - z.But since y + z ≤ c, and x + y + z ≤ 1, we have x ≤ 1 - y - z.But since y + z ≤ c, then 1 - y - z ≥ 1 - c.Wait, maybe it's better to change the order of integration.Let me fix z first. z goes from 0 to c.For each z, y goes from 0 to c - z.For each y, x goes from 0 to 1 - y - z.So, the volume V_lower is:∫ (z=0 to c) ∫ (y=0 to c - z) ∫ (x=0 to 1 - y - z) dx dy dzCompute the inner integral first:∫ (x=0 to 1 - y - z) dx = 1 - y - zThen, integrate over y:∫ (y=0 to c - z) (1 - y - z) dyLet me make a substitution: let u = y + z, then when y=0, u=z, and when y=c - z, u = c.But maybe it's easier to expand the integrand:(1 - z) - ySo, integrating (1 - z) - y dy from 0 to c - z:= (1 - z)y - (1/2)y^2 evaluated from 0 to c - z= (1 - z)(c - z) - (1/2)(c - z)^2= (c - z - c z + z^2) - (1/2)(c^2 - 2c z + z^2)= c - z - c z + z^2 - (1/2)c^2 + c z - (1/2)z^2Simplify term by term:c - z - c z + z^2 - (1/2)c^2 + c z - (1/2)z^2Combine like terms:c - z - (1/2)c^2 + (z^2 - (1/2)z^2) + (-c z + c z)Simplify:c - z - (1/2)c^2 + (1/2)z^2So, the integral over y is c - z - (1/2)c^2 + (1/2)z^2Now, integrate this over z from 0 to c:∫ (z=0 to c) [c - z - (1/2)c^2 + (1/2)z^2] dzLet me break this into separate terms:∫ c dz - ∫ z dz - (1/2)c^2 ∫ dz + (1/2) ∫ z^2 dzCompute each integral:∫ c dz from 0 to c = c*z evaluated from 0 to c = c^2∫ z dz from 0 to c = (1/2)z^2 evaluated from 0 to c = (1/2)c^2∫ dz from 0 to c = z evaluated from 0 to c = c∫ z^2 dz from 0 to c = (1/3)z^3 evaluated from 0 to c = (1/3)c^3Putting it all together:c^2 - (1/2)c^2 - (1/2)c^2 + (1/2)(1/3)c^3Simplify:c^2 - (1/2)c^2 - (1/2)c^2 + (1/6)c^3= (c^2 - c^2) + (1/6)c^3= (1/6)c^3So, the volume of the lower part, V_lower = (1/6)c^3Similarly, the volume of the upper part, V_upper = Total volume - V_lower = (1/6) - (1/6)c^3 = (1/6)(1 - c^3)But wait, the problem states that the ratio of the distance from AB to the plane to the distance from CD to the plane is k. So, d1/d2 = k.Earlier, I found that the total distance between AB and CD is 1/sqrt(2), and d1 = k/(k + 1)*1/sqrt(2), d2 = 1/(k + 1)*1/sqrt(2).But in my coordinate system, the plane is y + z = c, and the distance from AB (which is along y + z = 0) to the plane is c / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = c / sqrt(2). Similarly, the distance from CD (which is along y + z = 1) to the plane is (1 - c)/sqrt(2).So, d1 = c / sqrt(2), d2 = (1 - c)/sqrt(2). Therefore, d1/d2 = c / (1 - c) = k.So, c / (1 - c) = k ⇒ c = k(1 - c) ⇒ c = k - k c ⇒ c + k c = k ⇒ c(1 + k) = k ⇒ c = k / (1 + k)So, c = k / (1 + k)Now, substitute c = k / (1 + k) into the volumes:V_lower = (1/6)c^3 = (1/6)(k / (1 + k))^3V_upper = (1/6)(1 - c^3) = (1/6)(1 - (k / (1 + k))^3)But wait, actually, in my earlier calculation, V_lower was the region y + z ≤ c, which is closer to AB, so that's correct.But the problem asks for the ratio of the volumes of the two parts. So, the ratio V_lower : V_upper is [(1/6)(k / (1 + k))^3] : [(1/6)(1 - (k / (1 + k))^3)]Simplify the ratio:= (k^3 / (1 + k)^3) : (1 - k^3 / (1 + k)^3)= (k^3) : ((1 + k)^3 - k^3)Compute (1 + k)^3 - k^3:= 1 + 3k + 3k^2 + k^3 - k^3= 1 + 3k + 3k^2So, the ratio is k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)But wait, let me double-check:(1 + k)^3 = 1 + 3k + 3k^2 + k^3So, (1 + k)^3 - k^3 = 1 + 3k + 3k^2Therefore, the ratio V_lower : V_upper = k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)But the problem asks for the ratio of the volumes of the two parts. It doesn't specify which part first, but usually, it's the order mentioned: the part closer to AB and the part closer to CD.So, if V_lower is closer to AB, and V_upper is closer to CD, then the ratio is V_lower : V_upper = k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)But let me check if this makes sense for some values of k.For example, if k = 1, meaning the distances are equal, then c = 1/2.Then, V_lower = (1/6)(1/2)^3 = 1/48V_upper = (1/6)(1 - (1/2)^3) = (1/6)(7/8) = 7/48So, the ratio is 1:7, which is 1^3 : (1 + 3*1 + 3*1^2) = 1:7, which matches.Another test: if k approaches 0, meaning the plane is very close to AB, then V_lower approaches 0, and V_upper approaches the total volume. Plugging k=0, ratio is 0 : (1 + 0 + 0) = 0:1, which is correct.If k approaches infinity, meaning the plane is very close to CD, then V_upper approaches 0, and V_lower approaches the total volume. Plugging k=∞, ratio is ∞ : (1 + 3∞ + 3∞^2) ≈ ∞ : ∞^2, which tends to 0, meaning V_upper is negligible, which is correct.So, the ratio seems to hold.But wait, the problem states that the plane is parallel to AB and CD, and divides the tetrahedron into two parts. The ratio of the distances from AB to the plane and from CD to the plane is k.In my calculation, I found that c = k / (1 + k), and the volumes are V_lower = (1/6)c^3 and V_upper = (1/6)(1 - c^3). Therefore, the ratio V_lower : V_upper = c^3 : (1 - c^3) = (k^3 / (1 + k)^3) : (1 - k^3 / (1 + k)^3) = k^3 : ( (1 + k)^3 - k^3 ) = k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)But wait, another way to write 1 + 3k + 3k^2 is (k + 1)^3 - k^3, which is what we have.Alternatively, factor 1 + 3k + 3k^2:1 + 3k + 3k^2 = 3k^2 + 3k + 1But it doesn't factor nicely.So, the ratio is k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But the problem asks for the ratio of the volumes of the two parts. It doesn't specify which part first, but in the problem statement, it's divided into two parts by the plane, and the ratio of distances from AB to plane to CD to plane is k.So, the volume closer to AB is V_lower, and closer to CD is V_upper.Therefore, the ratio is V_lower : V_upper = k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But let me check if this is the correct ratio.Wait, in my earlier calculation, V_lower = (1/6)c^3 and V_upper = (1/6)(1 - c^3). So, the ratio is V_lower : V_upper = c^3 : (1 - c^3)But c = k / (1 + k), so c^3 = k^3 / (1 + k)^31 - c^3 = 1 - k^3 / (1 + k)^3 = [(1 + k)^3 - k^3] / (1 + k)^3 = (1 + 3k + 3k^2) / (1 + k)^3Therefore, the ratio V_lower : V_upper = [k^3 / (1 + k)^3] : [ (1 + 3k + 3k^2) / (1 + k)^3 ] = k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)So, yes, that's correct.But wait, the problem might expect the ratio in the order of the two parts as divided by the plane. Since the plane is closer to AB with ratio k, the volume closer to AB is smaller if k < 1, and larger if k > 1.But in our ratio, V_lower : V_upper = k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2). So, if k=1, it's 1:7, which is correct.Alternatively, sometimes the ratio is expressed as the smaller part to the larger part, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think we should present it as V_lower : V_upper = k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)But let me see if this can be simplified or expressed differently.Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: k^3Denominator: 3k^2 + 3k + 1I don't think they have common factors, so the ratio is k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)Alternatively, we can write it as k^3 / (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But the problem asks for the ratio of the volumes of the two parts, so it's better to present it as k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But let me check if there's another approach.Alternatively, since the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the cross-section is a quadrilateral, and the volumes can be found using the areas of the cross-sections and integrating.But I think the approach I took with coordinates and integrating is correct.So, the final ratio is k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But wait, let me think again. The volume closer to AB is V_lower = (1/6)c^3, and the volume closer to CD is V_upper = (1/6)(1 - c^3). So, the ratio is V_lower : V_upper = c^3 : (1 - c^3)But c = k / (1 + k), so c^3 = k^3 / (1 + k)^3, and 1 - c^3 = (1 + 3k + 3k^2)/(1 + k)^3Therefore, the ratio is k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2)Yes, that's correct.So, the ratio of the volumes is k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But let me check if this can be simplified or if there's a different way to express it.Alternatively, factor the denominator:3k^2 + 3k + 1 = 3(k^2 + k) + 1But that doesn't help much.Alternatively, write it as k^3 : (1 + 3k + 3k^2) = k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)I think that's as simplified as it gets.So, the ratio of the volumes of the two parts is k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)Therefore, the final answer is boxed{dfrac{k^3}{3k^2 + 3k + 1}}Wait, but the problem asks for the ratio of the volumes of the two parts, not necessarily as a fraction. So, it could be expressed as k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1), but often ratios are expressed in fraction form.Alternatively, if we consider the ratio of the smaller volume to the larger volume, depending on k, but since k can be any positive real number, it's better to present it as k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1)But in the problem statement, it's just the ratio of the volumes of the two parts, so either way is acceptable, but since the user asked for the ratio, and in the thought process I derived it as k^3 : (3k^2 + 3k + 1), I think that's the answer.But wait, in the initial problem, the plane is parallel to AB and CD, and the ratio of distances is k. So, the volume closer to AB is V_lower and closer to CD is V_upper.

I remember that there are formulas for summing infinite series, especially geometric series, but this isn't a straightforward geometric series because of the k in the numerator. Maybe it's an arithmetic-geometric series? I think that's what it's called when each term is the product of an arithmetic sequence and a geometric sequence. Let me recall. For an infinite series where each term is k*r^k, the sum can be found using a specific formula. I think the formula is S = r/(1 - r)^2, where |r| < 1. Is that right? Let me check. If we have S = sum_{k=1}^∞ k*r^k, then yes, the sum is r/(1 - r)^2. Wait, in this case, our series is sum_{k=1}^∞ k/(4^k). So, that's the same as sum_{k=1}^∞ k*(1/4)^k. So, here, r is 1/4. Plugging into the formula, S should be (1/4)/(1 - 1/4)^2. Let me compute that. First, compute the denominator: 1 - 1/4 is 3/4. Then, square that: (3/4)^2 is 9/16. So, the denominator becomes 9/16. Then, the numerator is 1/4. So, S is (1/4) divided by (9/16). Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so (1/4)*(16/9) = 4/9. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should derive the formula to be sure. Let me denote S = sum_{k=1}^∞ k*r^k. Then, if I multiply both sides by r, I get rS = sum_{k=1}^∞ k*r^{k+1} = sum_{k=2}^∞ (k-1)*r^k. Now, subtract rS from S: S - rS = sum_{k=1}^∞ k*r^k - sum_{k=2}^∞ (k-1)*r^k. On the right-hand side, the first term is k=1: 1*r^1, and for k>=2, it's k*r^k - (k-1)*r^k = r^k. So, S(1 - r) = r + sum_{k=2}^∞ r^k. The sum from k=2 to infinity of r^k is a geometric series starting from k=2. The sum of a geometric series starting from k=0 is 1/(1 - r), so starting from k=2, it's sum_{k=2}^∞ r^k = (r^2)/(1 - r). Therefore, S(1 - r) = r + (r^2)/(1 - r). Let's combine these terms: r*(1 - r)/(1 - r) + r^2/(1 - r) = [r - r^2 + r^2]/(1 - r) = r/(1 - r). So, S(1 - r) = r/(1 - r), which implies S = r/(1 - r)^2. Okay, that confirms the formula. So, going back to our problem, r is 1/4. Therefore, S = (1/4)/(1 - 1/4)^2 = (1/4)/(9/16) = (1/4)*(16/9) = 4/9. Wait, so the sum is 4/9. That seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or calculus? Alternatively, I can think of the series as the derivative of a geometric series. Let me recall that the sum of a geometric series is sum_{k=0}^∞ r^k = 1/(1 - r). If I take the derivative with respect to r, I get sum_{k=0}^∞ k*r^{k-1} = 1/(1 - r)^2. Multiplying both sides by r gives sum_{k=0}^∞ k*r^k = r/(1 - r)^2. But our series starts at k=1, so it's the same as sum_{k=1}^∞ k*r^k = r/(1 - r)^2. Therefore, again, plugging in r = 1/4, we get S = (1/4)/(1 - 1/4)^2 = 4/9. Okay, so both methods give the same result. I think I'm confident that the sum is 4/9. Just to double-check, maybe compute the partial sums numerically and see if they approach 4/9. Let's compute the first few terms: Term 1: 1/4 = 0.25Term 2: 2/16 = 0.125, total so far: 0.375Term 3: 3/64 ≈ 0.046875, total: ≈0.421875Term 4: 4/256 = 0.015625, total: ≈0.4375Term 5: 5/1024 ≈0.0048828125, total:≈0.4423828125Term 6:6/4096≈0.00146484375, total≈0.44384765625Term7:7/16384≈0.000427, total≈0.444275Term8:8/65536≈0.000122, total≈0.444397Term9:9/262144≈0.0000343, total≈0.444431Term10:10/1048576≈0.0000095, total≈0.4444405So, after 10 terms, the partial sum is approximately 0.4444405. 4/9 is approximately 0.4444444444... So, it's converging to 4/9. That gives me more confidence.Therefore, I think the sum is indeed 4/9."},{"question":"Given sintheta + costheta = frac{1}{5}, with theta in (0,pi),1. Find the value of tantheta;2. Find the value of frac{1+sin 2theta + cos 2theta}{1+sin 2theta - cos 2theta}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given that sinθ + cosθ equals 1/5, and θ is between 0 and π. I need to find tanθ and then evaluate this fraction involving sin2θ and cos2θ. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, for part 1, finding tanθ. I remember that tanθ is sinθ over cosθ, so if I can find sinθ and cosθ individually, I can just divide them to get tanθ. But right now, I only know that their sum is 1/5. Maybe I can square both sides of the equation to get more information. Let me try that.So, if I square sinθ + cosθ, I get (sinθ + cosθ)^2 = (1/5)^2. Expanding the left side, that's sin²θ + 2sinθcosθ + cos²θ. I know that sin²θ + cos²θ equals 1, so substituting that in, I get 1 + 2sinθcosθ = 1/25. Hmm, so 2sinθcosθ must be 1/25 - 1, which is -24/25. Therefore, sinθcosθ is -12/25. Wait, no, 2sinθcosθ is -24/25, so sinθcosθ is -12/25. Okay, got that.Now, since θ is between 0 and π, sinθ is positive because sine is positive in the first and second quadrants. But cosθ could be positive or negative. Since their product sinθcosθ is negative, that means one of them is positive and the other is negative. Since sinθ is positive, cosθ must be negative. So θ is in the second quadrant where cosine is negative. That helps me know the signs of sinθ and cosθ.Maybe I can find sinθ - cosθ as well. Let me think. If I have sinθ + cosθ = 1/5 and sinθ - cosθ, I can square that too. Let me try that.So, (sinθ - cosθ)^2 = sin²θ - 2sinθcosθ + cos²θ. Again, sin²θ + cos²θ is 1, so this becomes 1 - 2sinθcosθ. I already know that sinθcosθ is -12/25, so plugging that in, it's 1 - 2*(-12/25) = 1 + 24/25 = 49/25. Taking the square root, sinθ - cosθ is 7/5. But wait, since θ is in the second quadrant, cosθ is negative, so sinθ - cosθ would be sinθ minus a negative, which is sinθ + |cosθ|. Since both sinθ and |cosθ| are positive, sinθ - cosθ is positive. So, sinθ - cosθ is 7/5.Now I have two equations:1. sinθ + cosθ = 1/52. sinθ - cosθ = 7/5I can solve these simultaneously. Let me add them together. Adding equation 1 and equation 2:(sinθ + cosθ) + (sinθ - cosθ) = 1/5 + 7/52sinθ = 8/5So, sinθ = 4/5.Now, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:(sinθ - cosθ) - (sinθ + cosθ) = 7/5 - 1/5-2cosθ = 6/5So, cosθ = -3/5.Great, so sinθ is 4/5 and cosθ is -3/5. Therefore, tanθ is sinθ over cosθ, which is (4/5)/(-3/5) = -4/3. So, tanθ is -4/3.Now, moving on to part 2. I need to find the value of [1 + sin2θ + cos2θ] divided by [1 + sin2θ - cos2θ]. Hmm, okay, let me recall some double-angle identities. I know that sin2θ is 2sinθcosθ and cos2θ can be expressed in a few ways, like cos²θ - sin²θ or 1 - 2sin²θ or 2cos²θ - 1. Maybe I'll use cos²θ - sin²θ because I already have sinθ and cosθ.So, let's compute sin2θ and cos2θ.First, sin2θ is 2*(4/5)*(-3/5) = 2*(-12/25) = -24/25.Next, cos2θ is cos²θ - sin²θ. So, cos²θ is (9/25) and sin²θ is (16/25). Therefore, cos2θ is 9/25 - 16/25 = -7/25.Now, let's plug these into the expression.Numerator: 1 + sin2θ + cos2θ = 1 + (-24/25) + (-7/25) = 1 - 24/25 - 7/25.Let me compute that. 1 is 25/25, so 25/25 - 24/25 - 7/25 = (25 - 24 - 7)/25 = (-6)/25.Denominator: 1 + sin2θ - cos2θ = 1 + (-24/25) - (-7/25) = 1 - 24/25 + 7/25.Again, 1 is 25/25, so 25/25 - 24/25 + 7/25 = (25 - 24 + 7)/25 = 8/25.So, the fraction becomes (-6/25) divided by (8/25). The 25s cancel out, so it's -6/8, which simplifies to -3/4.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For sin2θ: 2*(4/5)*(-3/5) = -24/25. That seems right.For cos2θ: (9/25) - (16/25) = -7/25. Correct.Numerator: 1 - 24/25 - 7/25 = (25 - 24 - 7)/25 = (-6)/25. Yes.Denominator: 1 - 24/25 + 7/25 = (25 - 24 + 7)/25 = 8/25. Correct.So, (-6/25)/(8/25) = -6/8 = -3/4. Yep, that seems right.So, the value of the expression is -3/4.I think that's all. I didn't see any mistakes in my steps, so I feel confident about these answers.**Final Answer**1. boxed{-dfrac{4}{3}}  2. boxed{-dfrac{3}{4}}"},{"question":"Let x and y be non-negative real numbers. Let m and M be the minimum value and maximum value of [frac{|x^2 - y^2|}{x + y},] respectively, where x+y neq 0. Find M - m.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the expression (frac{|x^2 - y^2|}{x + y}), where (x) and (y) are non-negative real numbers and (x + y neq 0). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I notice that the expression involves absolute values and a fraction. The numerator is (|x^2 - y^2|), which is the absolute difference of the squares of (x) and (y). The denominator is (x + y), which is the sum of (x) and (y). Since (x) and (y) are non-negative, (x + y) is also non-negative, and it's given that (x + y neq 0), so the denominator isn't zero. That means the expression is well-defined.I remember that (x^2 - y^2) can be factored as ((x - y)(x + y)). So, let me rewrite the numerator:[|x^2 - y^2| = |(x - y)(x + y)|]Since absolute value of a product is the product of absolute values, this becomes:[|x - y| cdot |x + y|]But (x) and (y) are non-negative, so (x + y) is non-negative, which means (|x + y| = x + y). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:[|x - y| cdot (x + y)]Now, substituting back into the original expression:[frac{|x^2 - y^2|}{x + y} = frac{|x - y| cdot (x + y)}{x + y}]Since (x + y neq 0), we can safely cancel out (x + y) in the numerator and denominator:[frac{|x - y| cdot (x + y)}{x + y} = |x - y|]Oh, so the original expression simplifies to just (|x - y|)! That makes things a lot easier. Now, instead of dealing with the fraction, I just need to find the minimum and maximum values of (|x - y|) given that (x) and (y) are non-negative real numbers.Let me think about the possible values of (|x - y|). Since (x) and (y) are non-negative, the smallest possible value of (|x - y|) occurs when (x = y). In that case, (|x - y| = 0). So, the minimum value (m) is 0.Now, what about the maximum value (M)? Since (x) and (y) can be any non-negative real numbers, (|x - y|) can be made as large as we want. For example, if we fix (y = 0) and let (x) approach infinity, then (|x - y| = |x - 0| = x) can become arbitrarily large. Similarly, if we fix (x = 0) and let (y) approach infinity, (|x - y| = |0 - y| = y) can also become arbitrarily large.Therefore, the maximum value (M) is unbounded; it can be made infinitely large. In mathematical terms, (M) approaches infinity.So, now I need to find (M - m). Since (m = 0) and (M) is infinity, the difference (M - m) is also infinity.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression simplifies to (|x - y|), which is correct because (x) and (y) are non-negative, so (x + y) is positive and cancels out. The minimum value is indeed 0 when (x = y), and the maximum is unbounded because (x) or (y) can be made as large as desired. Therefore, (M - m) is infinity.Hmm, but in some contexts, infinity minus zero is still infinity, so that makes sense.

Let me take it step by step.First, let's understand the setup: we have two non-coincident lines, m and n, and two planes, α and β. The propositions involve various relationships between these lines and planes, like parallelism and perpendicularity. I need to check each proposition one by one.Starting with proposition ①: If m is parallel to α, n is parallel to β, and α is parallel to β, then does it follow that m is parallel to n?Hmm, so m is parallel to plane α, which means m doesn't intersect α and lies in a direction that's parallel to α. Similarly, n is parallel to β, and since α is parallel to β, the planes themselves don't intersect. But does that mean m and n must be parallel?Wait, I think not necessarily. Because even if the planes are parallel, the lines m and n could be in different directions within their respective planes. For example, imagine two parallel planes, like two sheets of paper lying flat on a table. If I draw a horizontal line on the top sheet and a vertical line on the bottom sheet, both lines are parallel to their respective planes, but the lines themselves are not parallel—they could even be skew lines. So proposition ① doesn't hold. I think ① is false.Moving on to proposition ②: If m is parallel to n, m is contained in α, and n is perpendicular to β, then does it follow that α is perpendicular to β?Alright, so m and n are parallel lines, and m is in plane α. If n is perpendicular to plane β, that means n is a line that forms a right angle with every line in β. Since m is parallel to n, and m is in α, does that mean α must be perpendicular to β?Let me visualize this. If n is perpendicular to β, then any line parallel to n should also be perpendicular to β. Since m is parallel to n, m must also be perpendicular to β. But m is in plane α. So, if a line in α is perpendicular to β, does that make α perpendicular to β?Yes, I think so. Because if a line in one plane is perpendicular to another plane, then the two planes must be perpendicular to each other. So proposition ② seems to be true.Next is proposition ③: If the intersection of α and β is line m, and m is parallel to n, then does it follow that n is parallel to both α and β?Okay, so α and β intersect along line m, and n is parallel to m. Does that mean n is parallel to both planes?Well, if n is parallel to m, and m is the intersection line of α and β, then n should be parallel to both α and β. Because if a line is parallel to the intersection line of two planes, it doesn't intersect either plane, right? So n can't be intersecting α or β, which means it's parallel to both. So proposition ③ seems true.Wait, hold on. Is that always the case? Suppose n is parallel to m, but n is actually lying on one of the planes. For example, if n is in plane α, then n is not parallel to α, it's actually in α. But the proposition says n is parallel to α and β. Hmm, so if n is in α, it can't be parallel to α. So maybe the proposition is only true if n is not in either plane.But the problem statement says m and n are non-coincident lines, but it doesn't specify whether n is in α or β. So if n is in α, then it's not parallel to α. Therefore, the proposition might not always hold. So maybe proposition ③ is false.Wait, no. The proposition says \\"n is parallel to α and n is parallel to β.\\" If n is in α, it's not parallel to α. So if n is parallel to m, which is the intersection of α and β, n could be in α or β, making it not parallel to that plane. Therefore, proposition ③ is not necessarily true. So ③ is false.Finally, proposition ④: If the intersection of α and β is line m, and m is perpendicular to n, then does it follow that n is perpendicular to both α and β?So m is the intersection line, and n is perpendicular to m. Does that mean n is perpendicular to both planes α and β?Hmm, if a line is perpendicular to the intersection line of two planes, does that make it perpendicular to both planes? I don't think so. For a line to be perpendicular to a plane, it needs to be perpendicular to every line in that plane, not just the intersection line.For example, imagine two planes intersecting at line m. If n is perpendicular to m, it could be that n is only perpendicular to m but lies in one of the planes, making it not perpendicular to the other plane. Or n could be skew to both planes but only perpendicular to m.Wait, actually, if n is perpendicular to m, and m is the intersection of α and β, then n must be perpendicular to both α and β. Because if n is perpendicular to m, and m is in both α and β, then n must be perpendicular to every line in α and β that intersects m. But is that enough?No, I think not. Because to be perpendicular to a plane, a line must be perpendicular to every line in that plane, not just the intersection line. So n being perpendicular to m doesn't necessarily mean it's perpendicular to all lines in α and β. Therefore, proposition ④ is false.Wait, but if n is perpendicular to m, and m is the intersection of α and β, then n is perpendicular to both planes. Because if n is perpendicular to m, and m is in both planes, then n must be perpendicular to both planes. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.Let me think again. If n is perpendicular to m, which is in both α and β, then n is perpendicular to two lines in each plane: m and any other line in α or β that n intersects. But unless n is perpendicular to two non-parallel lines in each plane, it's not necessarily perpendicular to the entire plane.Wait, no. If n is perpendicular to m, and m is the intersection line, then n is perpendicular to both planes. Because if a line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of two planes, it's perpendicular to both planes. Is that a theorem?I think yes. If a line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of two planes, then it is perpendicular to both planes. So proposition ④ is true.Wait, but earlier I thought it wasn't. Maybe I was wrong. Let me confirm.If n is perpendicular to m, and m is the intersection of α and β, then n is perpendicular to both α and β. Because for a line to be perpendicular to a plane, it needs to be perpendicular to two non-parallel lines in that plane. Since m is in both α and β, and n is perpendicular to m, if n is also in a direction that makes it perpendicular to another line in α or β, then it would be perpendicular to the plane.But wait, the proposition only states that n is perpendicular to m. It doesn't say anything about n being in a particular direction relative to α or β. So maybe n is only perpendicular to m, but not necessarily to the entire plane.I think I need to recall the theorem. The theorem states that if a line is perpendicular to two intersecting lines at a point, then it is perpendicular to the plane. But in this case, n is only known to be perpendicular to m, which is the intersection line. So unless n is also perpendicular to another line in α or β, we can't conclude it's perpendicular to the entire plane.Therefore, proposition ④ is not necessarily true. So ④ is false.Wait, but if n is perpendicular to m, and m is the intersection of α and β, then n is perpendicular to both planes. Because m is in both planes, and n is perpendicular to m, so n must be perpendicular to both planes. Hmm, I'm confused.Maybe I should look up the theorem. According to the theorem, if a line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of two planes, then it is perpendicular to both planes. So yes, proposition ④ is true.But earlier, I thought it wasn't. Maybe I was wrong. So, proposition ④ is true.Wait, but in my initial thought, I thought it was false. Now, after considering the theorem, I think it's true. So maybe I need to correct myself.So, summarizing:①: False②: True③: False④: TrueBut wait, earlier I thought ③ was false because n could be in one of the planes, making it not parallel. But the proposition says \\"n is parallel to α and n is parallel to β.\\" If n is in α, it's not parallel to α. So the proposition is only true if n is not in α or β. But the problem doesn't specify that. So, since n could be in one of the planes, making it not parallel, the proposition isn't necessarily true. So ③ is false.Similarly, for ④, based on the theorem, if n is perpendicular to m, the intersection line, then n is perpendicular to both planes. So ④ is true.Wait, but I'm still unsure about ④. Let me think of an example. Suppose α and β are two planes intersecting along m. If n is perpendicular to m, does n have to be perpendicular to both α and β?Imagine α is the xy-plane and β is the xz-plane, intersecting along the x-axis (m). If n is a line perpendicular to the x-axis, say along the y-axis, then n is perpendicular to α (the xy-plane) but not to β (the xz-plane). Wait, no. If n is along the y-axis, it's perpendicular to the x-axis, but it's not perpendicular to the xz-plane. Because in the xz-plane, the y-axis is perpendicular, but n is along the y-axis, which is perpendicular to the xz-plane.Wait, actually, if n is along the y-axis, it is perpendicular to the xz-plane (β) because it's perpendicular to every line in β. Similarly, it's perpendicular to the xy-plane (α) because it's perpendicular to every line in α. So in this case, n is perpendicular to both planes.But what if n is not along the y-axis? Suppose n is in some other direction, still perpendicular to m (the x-axis). For example, n could be in the direction of (0,1,1). Is that line perpendicular to both planes?Wait, no. If n is in the direction (0,1,1), it's not perpendicular to the xy-plane because it has a z-component. Similarly, it's not perpendicular to the xz-plane because it has a y-component. So in this case, n is perpendicular to m (the x-axis), but not perpendicular to either plane.Wait, so that contradicts the theorem I thought of earlier. So maybe the theorem requires n to be perpendicular to m and also lie in a specific orientation.Wait, no. The theorem says if a line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of two planes, then it is perpendicular to both planes. But in my example, n is perpendicular to m but not to the planes. So maybe the theorem is not as general as I thought.I think the confusion arises because the theorem might require the line to be perpendicular to the planes, not just the intersection line. So, if n is perpendicular to m, it doesn't necessarily mean it's perpendicular to the entire plane unless it's also perpendicular to another line in the plane.Therefore, proposition ④ is false.Wait, so now I'm back to thinking ④ is false. This is confusing.Let me try to clarify. If a line is perpendicular to the line of intersection of two planes, is it necessarily perpendicular to both planes?No, because being perpendicular to the intersection line doesn't ensure it's perpendicular to every line in the plane. It only ensures it's perpendicular to that specific line. To be perpendicular to the plane, it needs to be perpendicular to two non-parallel lines in the plane.Therefore, proposition ④ is false.So, going back:①: False②: True③: False④: FalseWait, but earlier I thought ④ was true based on a theorem, but now I'm convinced it's false because of the counterexample.So, the only true proposition is ②.But wait, let me double-check proposition ③. If α and β intersect along m, and n is parallel to m, does n have to be parallel to both α and β?If n is parallel to m, then n doesn't intersect m. Since m is in both α and β, n doesn't intersect α or β, so n must be parallel to both planes. But wait, if n is in one of the planes, say α, then n is not parallel to α. So the proposition is only true if n is not in either plane.But the problem states that m and n are non-coincident lines, but it doesn't specify whether n is in α or β. So, n could be in α or β, making it not parallel to that plane. Therefore, proposition ③ is not necessarily true. So ③ is false.Therefore, the only true proposition is ②."},{"question":"Let mathbf{B} be a matrix such that[mathbf{B} begin{pmatrix} 4  -1 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 12  -3 end{pmatrix}.]Find mathbf{B}^4 begin{pmatrix} 4  -1 end{pmatrix}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given a matrix **B** such that when it's multiplied by the vector (4, -1), it gives (12, -3). I need to find **B**⁴ multiplied by the same vector (4, -1). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down what I know. The matrix **B** times the vector (4, -1) equals (12, -3). So, in equation form, that's:**B** * [4; -1] = [12; -3]Hmm, interesting. I notice that [12; -3] is just 3 times [4; -1]. Let me check that:3 * [4; -1] = [12; -3]Yes, that's correct. So, that means when I multiply **B** by the vector [4; -1], I'm just scaling that vector by 3. So, in other words, **B** is acting like a scalar multiple on this specific vector. That makes me think that [4; -1] is an eigenvector of **B**, and 3 is the corresponding eigenvalue. Wait, what's an eigenvector again? If I remember correctly, an eigenvector of a matrix is a non-zero vector that only changes by a scalar factor when that matrix is applied to it. The scalar factor is called the eigenvalue. So, in this case, [4; -1] is an eigenvector, and 3 is the eigenvalue because **B** * [4; -1] = 3 * [4; -1].Okay, so if that's the case, then applying **B** multiple times would just scale the vector by 3 each time. So, **B** squared times [4; -1] would be **B** times **B** times [4; -1]. But since **B** times [4; -1] is 3 times [4; -1], then **B** squared times [4; -1] would be **B** times 3 times [4; -1], which is 3 times **B** times [4; -1], which is 3 times 3 times [4; -1], so 3 squared times [4; -1].Similarly, **B** cubed times [4; -1] would be 3 cubed times [4; -1], and so on. So, in general, **B** to the power of n times [4; -1] would be 3 to the power of n times [4; -1].Therefore, for **B**⁴ times [4; -1], that should be 3⁴ times [4; -1]. Let me compute 3⁴. 3 squared is 9, so 3⁴ is 9 squared, which is 81. So, 81 times [4; -1] would be [81*4; 81*(-1)].Calculating that, 81 times 4 is 324, and 81 times -1 is -81. So, putting that together, **B**⁴ times [4; -1] should be [324; -81].Wait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. So, starting from **B** * [4; -1] = 3*[4; -1], then **B**² * [4; -1] = **B***(**B** * [4; -1]) = **B***(3*[4; -1]) = 3*(**B** * [4; -1]) = 3*(3*[4; -1]) = 9*[4; -1]. That seems right.Then, **B**³ * [4; -1] = **B***(**B**² * [4; -1]) = **B***(9*[4; -1]) = 9*(**B** * [4; -1]) = 9*(3*[4; -1]) = 27*[4; -1]. Yep, that's 3 cubed.Continuing, **B**⁴ * [4; -1] = **B***(**B**³ * [4; -1]) = **B***(27*[4; -1]) = 27*(**B** * [4; -1]) = 27*(3*[4; -1]) = 81*[4; -1]. So, that's 3⁴, which is 81, times the vector [4; -1], resulting in [324; -81]. I think that makes sense. So, each time I apply **B**, I'm just scaling the vector by 3, so applying it four times scales it by 3 four times, which is 81. Is there another way to think about this? Maybe by actually finding the matrix **B**? Let me see if that's possible. If I can find **B**, then I can compute **B**⁴ and multiply it by [4; -1]. But I'm not sure if I have enough information to uniquely determine **B**. I know that **B** is a 2x2 matrix because it's multiplying a 2x1 vector and giving a 2x1 vector. So, let me denote **B** as:[ a  b ][ c  d ]Then, multiplying **B** by [4; -1] gives:[ a*4 + b*(-1) ][ c*4 + d*(-1) ]Which equals [12; -3]. So, setting up the equations:4a - b = 124c - d = -3So, I have two equations with four variables. That means there are infinitely many solutions for **B**. Without more information, I can't uniquely determine **B**. So, maybe that approach isn't helpful here. But since I don't need the actual matrix **B**, just the result of **B**⁴ times [4; -1], and I noticed that [4; -1] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 3, I can use that property to find the result without knowing the entire matrix. That seems much more straightforward.So, in summary, since **B** acting on [4; -1] scales it by 3, applying **B** four times will scale it by 3⁴, which is 81. Therefore, the result is 81 times [4; -1], which is [324; -81].I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the alternative approach of trying to find **B** just complicates things unnecessarily since we don't have enough information. So, I'm confident that the answer is [324; -81].**Final Answer**The result of (mathbf{B}^4 begin{pmatrix} 4  -1 end{pmatrix}) is boxed{begin{pmatrix} 324  -81 end{pmatrix}}."},{"question":"A natural number ( k ) has the property: if ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), then the number formed by writing the digits of ( n ) in reverse order is also divisible by ( k ). Prove that ( k ) is a factor of 99.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: A natural number ( k ) has the property that if ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), then the number formed by writing the digits of ( n ) in reverse order is also divisible by ( k ). I need to prove that ( k ) is a factor of 99. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this.First, let's understand the property. If ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), then reversing its digits also gives a number divisible by ( k ). So, ( k ) has this symmetry in a way with respect to divisibility when digits are reversed. Interesting.Maybe I should start by considering some examples. Let's take ( k = 9 ). If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9. Reversing the digits doesn't change the sum of the digits, so the reversed number should also be divisible by 9. That works. Similarly, ( k = 11 ) has a divisibility rule where the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions must be a multiple of 11. Reversing the digits would flip the positions, but the difference would still be a multiple of 11. So, ( k = 11 ) also has this property.Wait, both 9 and 11 are factors of 99. So, maybe ( k ) has to be a factor of 99? That seems to be the case with these examples. But I need to prove it in general.Let me think about how reversing the digits affects a number. Suppose ( n ) is a number with digits ( d_1d_2d_3...d_m ). Then ( n ) can be expressed as:[n = d_1 times 10^{m-1} + d_2 times 10^{m-2} + dots + d_{m-1} times 10 + d_m]When we reverse the digits, we get:[text{reverse}(n) = d_m times 10^{m-1} + d_{m-1} times 10^{m-2} + dots + d_2 times 10 + d_1]So, the reversed number is a different linear combination of the digits, scaled by powers of 10.Since ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), we have ( n equiv 0 mod k ). We need to show that ( text{reverse}(n) equiv 0 mod k ).Maybe I can express ( text{reverse}(n) ) in terms of ( n ) and some other terms. Let's see.Let me consider a two-digit number first to simplify. Suppose ( n = 10a + b ). Then ( text{reverse}(n) = 10b + a ). If ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), then ( 10a + b equiv 0 mod k ). We need ( 10b + a equiv 0 mod k ).From ( 10a + b equiv 0 mod k ), we can write ( 10a equiv -b mod k ). Then, substituting into the reversed number:[10b + a equiv 10b + a mod k]But from ( 10a equiv -b mod k ), we can solve for ( a ):[a equiv -frac{b}{10} mod k]Wait, but division by 10 modulo ( k ) requires that 10 and ( k ) are coprime. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, let's consider the difference between ( n ) and ( text{reverse}(n) ):[n - text{reverse}(n) = (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 9a - 9b = 9(a - b)]So, ( n - text{reverse}(n) = 9(a - b) ). If ( k ) divides ( n ), and ( k ) divides ( text{reverse}(n) ), then ( k ) must divide their difference, which is ( 9(a - b) ). Therefore, ( k ) divides ( 9(a - b) ). But since ( k ) divides ( n = 10a + b ), and ( k ) divides ( 9(a - b) ), perhaps ( k ) must divide some combination of these.This seems a bit too specific to two-digit numbers. Maybe I should generalize.Suppose ( n ) is a number with ( m ) digits: ( n = d_1 times 10^{m-1} + d_2 times 10^{m-2} + dots + d_{m-1} times 10 + d_m ). Then ( text{reverse}(n) = d_m times 10^{m-1} + d_{m-1} times 10^{m-2} + dots + d_2 times 10 + d_1 ).If ( n equiv 0 mod k ), then ( text{reverse}(n) equiv 0 mod k ). So, ( n equiv text{reverse}(n) equiv 0 mod k ).Let me consider the difference ( n - text{reverse}(n) ). This difference must be divisible by ( k ) as well. Let's compute this difference:[n - text{reverse}(n) = (d_1 times 10^{m-1} + d_2 times 10^{m-2} + dots + d_{m-1} times 10 + d_m) - (d_m times 10^{m-1} + d_{m-1} times 10^{m-2} + dots + d_2 times 10 + d_1)]This simplifies to:[(d_1 - d_m) times 10^{m-1} + (d_2 - d_{m-1}) times 10^{m-2} + dots + (d_{m-1} - d_2) times 10 + (d_m - d_1)]Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let's see.Notice that each pair ( (d_i - d_{m+1-i}) ) is multiplied by ( 10^{m-i} ) and ( 10^{i-1} ) in some fashion. It might be helpful to consider specific cases, like when ( m ) is even or odd.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( text{reverse}(n) ) in terms of ( n ) and some multiple of 99. Wait, 99 is 9*11, and both 9 and 11 have these digit-related divisibility rules. Maybe this is a clue.Let me think about the properties of 99. Any number and its reverse differ by a multiple of 99. Is that always true? Let's test it with a number.Take ( n = 1234 ). Then ( text{reverse}(n) = 4321 ). The difference is ( 4321 - 1234 = 3087 ). Is 3087 divisible by 99? Let's check: 99*31 = 3069, 99*32 = 3168. So, 3087 is not divisible by 99. Hmm, so that's not always true.Wait, maybe it's not always a multiple of 99, but perhaps under certain conditions. Maybe if ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), then ( text{reverse}(n) ) is also divisible by ( k ), implying that ( k ) divides the difference ( n - text{reverse}(n) ). So, ( k ) divides ( n - text{reverse}(n) ).But ( n - text{reverse}(n) ) is a multiple of 99 in some cases, but not always. So, perhaps ( k ) must divide 99? Because if ( k ) divides ( n - text{reverse}(n) ) for all ( n ) divisible by ( k ), then ( k ) must be a factor of 99.Wait, that seems plausible. Let me try to formalize this.Suppose ( k ) has the property that if ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), then ( text{reverse}(n) ) is also divisible by ( k ). Then, for any ( n ) divisible by ( k ), ( n - text{reverse}(n) ) is divisible by ( k ). Therefore, ( k ) divides ( n - text{reverse}(n) ).But ( n - text{reverse}(n) ) can be written as a linear combination of the digits scaled by powers of 10. Specifically, as I wrote earlier:[n - text{reverse}(n) = sum_{i=1}^{m} (d_i - d_{m+1-i}) times 10^{m-i} - sum_{i=1}^{m} (d_i - d_{m+1-i}) times 10^{i-1}]This is a bit complicated, but perhaps I can factor out some terms. Let's consider that each term ( (d_i - d_{m+1-i}) ) is multiplied by ( 10^{m-i} - 10^{i-1} ).So,[n - text{reverse}(n) = sum_{i=1}^{m} (d_i - d_{m+1-i}) times (10^{m-i} - 10^{i-1})]Now, notice that ( 10^{m-i} - 10^{i-1} ) can be factored as ( 10^{i-1}(10^{m-2i+1} - 1) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, let's consider that ( 10^{m-i} - 10^{i-1} = 10^{i-1}(10^{m-2i+1} - 1) ). So, each term is a multiple of ( 10^{i-1} ) times something.But I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think about specific properties of ( k ).Since ( k ) divides both ( n ) and ( text{reverse}(n) ), it must divide their difference. So, ( k ) divides ( n - text{reverse}(n) ). But ( n - text{reverse}(n) ) is a multiple of 99 in some cases, but not always. So, perhaps ( k ) must be a factor of 99 to ensure that it divides this difference for any ( n ) divisible by ( k ).Wait, let's think about the fact that 99 is the least common multiple of 9 and 11, which are both factors related to digit sums and alternating sums. Since reversing the digits doesn't change the digit sum (for 9) or the alternating sum (for 11), maybe ( k ) must be a factor of 99 to maintain these properties.Alternatively, consider that if ( k ) divides ( n ) and ( text{reverse}(n) ), then ( k ) must divide any linear combination of ( n ) and ( text{reverse}(n) ). In particular, ( k ) must divide ( 10^{m}n - text{reverse}(n) times 10^{m} ) or something like that. Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe I can construct a specific number ( n ) such that ( n ) is divisible by ( k ), and then show that ( k ) must divide 99.Let me try to construct ( n ) as follows: Let ( n = 10a + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are digits. Then ( text{reverse}(n) = 10b + a ). If ( k ) divides ( n ), then ( k ) divides ( 10a + b ), and ( k ) divides ( 10b + a ).So, ( 10a + b equiv 0 mod k ) and ( 10b + a equiv 0 mod k ).Subtracting these two congruences:[(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 9a - 9b equiv 0 mod k]So, ( 9(a - b) equiv 0 mod k ). Therefore, ( k ) divides ( 9(a - b) ).But ( k ) also divides ( 10a + b ). So, ( k ) divides both ( 10a + b ) and ( 9(a - b) ).Let me see if I can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( k ). Suppose ( k ) divides ( 10a + b ), so ( 10a + b = mk ) for some integer ( m ). Similarly, ( 9(a - b) = nk ) for some integer ( n ).From ( 10a + b = mk ), we can write ( b = mk - 10a ). Substituting into ( 9(a - b) = nk ):[9(a - (mk - 10a)) = nk 9(a - mk + 10a) = nk 9(11a - mk) = nk 99a - 9mk = nk 99a = nk + 9mk 99a = k(n + 9m)]So, ( k ) divides ( 99a ). Since ( a ) is a digit (0-9), unless ( a = 0 ), ( k ) must divide 99. If ( a = 0 ), then ( n = b ), and ( text{reverse}(n) = b ), so ( k ) divides ( b ), which is a single digit. But ( k ) is a natural number, so ( k ) could be 1, which trivially divides everything. But since we're looking for non-trivial factors, ( k ) must divide 99.Wait, this seems to suggest that ( k ) divides 99. So, ( k ) is a factor of 99.But let me check if this holds for numbers with more digits. Suppose ( n ) is a three-digit number: ( n = 100a + 10b + c ). Then ( text{reverse}(n) = 100c + 10b + a ).If ( k ) divides ( n ), then ( k ) divides ( 100a + 10b + c ). We need ( k ) to divide ( 100c + 10b + a ).Subtracting these:[(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)]So, ( k ) divides ( 99(a - c) ). Since ( k ) divides ( n = 100a + 10b + c ), and ( k ) divides ( 99(a - c) ), similar to the two-digit case, ( k ) must divide 99.This pattern seems to hold. For an ( m )-digit number, the difference ( n - text{reverse}(n) ) is a multiple of 99. Therefore, ( k ) must divide 99.Hence, ( k ) is a factor of 99."},{"question":"In order to encourage residents to strengthen physical exercise, a community activity center is preparing to purchase 10 pairs of badminton rackets of a certain brand, with each pair of rackets coming with x (xgeqslant 3) shuttlecocks for residents in the community to borrow for free.

Please answer the following questions:<br/>(1) Write down the relationship between y_{A}, y_{B}, and x respectively;<br/>(2) If the activity center only purchases from one supermarket, which supermarket do you think is more cost-effective?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a community activity center wanting to buy badminton rackets and shuttlecocks. They need to decide between two supermarkets, A and B, based on which one is more cost-effective. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says they need 10 pairs of badminton rackets, and each pair comes with x shuttlecocks, where x is at least 3. Both supermarkets sell the same brand, with each racket costing 40 yuan and each shuttlecock costing 4 yuan. But each supermarket has a different promotion.Supermarket A offers a 20% discount on all products. So, everything is sold at 80% of the marked price. That means both the rackets and the shuttlecocks will be cheaper by 20%.Supermarket B has a different promotion: for every pair of badminton rackets you buy, you get 3 shuttlecocks for free. So, if you buy 10 pairs, you get 30 shuttlecocks for free. But you still have to pay for any additional shuttlecocks beyond that.The problem asks for two things:1. To write down the relationship between the total cost (y_A and y_B) and x for both supermarkets.2. To determine which supermarket is more cost-effective if the activity center only purchases from one.Okay, let's tackle the first part.**For Supermarket A:**Since everything is discounted by 20%, the cost of each racket is 40 yuan, so with a 20% discount, that's 40 * 0.8 = 32 yuan per racket. They need 10 pairs, so that's 10 * 32 = 320 yuan for the rackets.For the shuttlecocks, each one is 4 yuan, but with a 20% discount, that's 4 * 0.8 = 3.2 yuan per shuttlecock. They need x shuttlecocks per pair, so for 10 pairs, that's 10x shuttlecocks. So, the cost for shuttlecocks is 3.2 * 10x = 32x yuan.Therefore, the total cost at Supermarket A, y_A, is the sum of the cost for rackets and shuttlecocks:y_A = 320 + 32x**For Supermarket B:**Here, the promotion is \\"buy one pair, get 3 shuttlecocks free.\\" So, for each pair of rackets, you get 3 free shuttlecocks. Since they're buying 10 pairs, they get 10 * 3 = 30 shuttlecocks for free.They need x shuttlecocks per pair, so for 10 pairs, that's 10x shuttlecocks in total. But since they get 30 for free, they only need to pay for 10x - 30 shuttlecocks.The cost for the rackets is straightforward: 10 pairs at 40 yuan each, so 10 * 40 = 400 yuan.For the shuttlecocks, they need to pay for 10x - 30 shuttlecocks at 4 yuan each. So, the cost for shuttlecocks is 4 * (10x - 30) = 40x - 120 yuan.Therefore, the total cost at Supermarket B, y_B, is the sum of the cost for rackets and shuttlecocks:y_B = 400 + 40x - 120 = 40x + 280So, summarizing:y_A = 32x + 320y_B = 40x + 280Now, moving on to the second part: determining which supermarket is more cost-effective depending on the value of x.To compare y_A and y_B, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x to find the break-even point.Set y_A = y_B:32x + 320 = 40x + 280Let's solve for x:32x + 320 = 40x + 280Subtract 32x from both sides:320 = 8x + 280Subtract 280 from both sides:40 = 8xDivide both sides by 8:x = 5So, when x = 5, both supermarkets cost the same.Now, to determine which is cheaper when x is less than 5 or greater than 5, we can analyze the equations.For x < 5:Let's pick x = 4 (since x must be at least 3):y_A = 32*4 + 320 = 128 + 320 = 448 yuany_B = 40*4 + 280 = 160 + 280 = 440 yuanSo, y_B is cheaper when x = 4.For x > 5:Let's pick x = 6:y_A = 32*6 + 320 = 192 + 320 = 512 yuany_B = 40*6 + 280 = 240 + 280 = 520 yuanSo, y_A is cheaper when x = 6.Therefore, the conclusion is:- If x < 5, Supermarket B is more cost-effective.- If x = 5, both supermarkets cost the same.- If x > 5, Supermarket A is more cost-effective.This makes sense because Supermarket B gives a fixed number of free shuttlecocks per racket, which is beneficial when the number of shuttlecocks needed per racket is low. However, as the number of shuttlecocks needed increases, the discount at Supermarket A becomes more advantageous because it applies to all products, including the additional shuttlecocks.I think that's a thorough breakdown. I considered setting up the equations, solving for the break-even point, and testing values around that point to confirm which supermarket is cheaper in different scenarios. It's important to remember that the promotional offers affect the total cost differently based on the quantity of shuttlecocks needed."},{"question":"Given an even function fleft(xright), for any x, 2fleft(xright)+xf'left(xright) gt 6. Also, fleft(1right)=2. The solution set of the inequality x^{2}fleft(xright) gt 3x^{2}-1 is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given an even function ( f(x) ), for any ( x ), ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). Also, ( f(1) = 2 ). I need to find the solution set of the inequality ( x^2f(x) > 3x^2 - 1 ). Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.First, I know that ( f(x) ) is an even function, which means ( f(-x) = f(x) ). That might be useful later on, especially when considering symmetry in the solution set.Next, the condition ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ) is given for any ( x ). This looks like a differential inequality. Maybe I can manipulate this to find some properties of ( f(x) ).I also have the specific value ( f(1) = 2 ). That might help in determining constants or specific behaviors of the function.The inequality I need to solve is ( x^2f(x) > 3x^2 - 1 ). Let me rearrange this inequality to make it easier to handle. If I subtract ( 3x^2 ) from both sides, I get:( x^2f(x) - 3x^2 > -1 )Factor out ( x^2 ):( x^2(f(x) - 3) > -1 )Hmm, this might be useful. Maybe I can define a new function to simplify this expression. Let me define ( g(x) = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 ). Then the inequality becomes ( g(x) > -1 ).So, if I can find where ( g(x) > -1 ), that will solve the problem. Now, let's analyze ( g(x) ).Given that ( f(x) ) is even, ( f(-x) = f(x) ), so ( g(-x) = (-x)^2f(-x) - 3(-x)^2 = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 = g(x) ). Therefore, ( g(x) ) is also an even function. That means the behavior of ( g(x) ) for positive ( x ) will mirror its behavior for negative ( x ). So, I can focus on ( x > 0 ) and then extend the solution to ( x < 0 ) using symmetry.Now, let's find the derivative of ( g(x) ) to understand its behavior. For ( x > 0 ):( g(x) = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 )Taking the derivative with respect to ( x ):( g'(x) = 2xf(x) + x^2f'(x) - 6x )Factor out ( x ):( g'(x) = x(2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6) )But from the given condition, ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). So, ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6 > 0 ). Therefore, for ( x > 0 ):( g'(x) = x(text{something positive}) > 0 )Since ( x > 0 ) and ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6 > 0 ), it follows that ( g'(x) > 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ). This means that ( g(x) ) is strictly increasing on ( (0, infty) ).Given that ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ), and it's even, it must be decreasing for ( x < 0 ). So, the function ( g(x) ) has a minimum at ( x = 0 ).Wait, let me check that. If ( g(x) ) is even and increasing for ( x > 0 ), then for ( x < 0 ), as ( x ) becomes more negative, ( g(x) ) increases because ( g(-x) = g(x) ). So, actually, ( g(x) ) is decreasing on ( (-infty, 0) ) and increasing on ( (0, infty) ). So, it has a minimum at ( x = 0 ).Now, let's evaluate ( g(1) ). Since ( f(1) = 2 ):( g(1) = (1)^2f(1) - 3(1)^2 = 1*2 - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 )So, ( g(1) = -1 ). That's interesting because our inequality is ( g(x) > -1 ). So, at ( x = 1 ), ( g(x) = -1 ), which is the boundary of our inequality.Since ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ), and ( g(1) = -1 ), then for ( x > 1 ), ( g(x) > -1 ) because it's increasing beyond that point. Similarly, for ( x < -1 ), since ( g(x) ) is even, ( g(x) = g(-x) ), and since ( g(-x) > -1 ) when ( -x > 1 ) (i.e., ( x < -1 )), then ( g(x) > -1 ) for ( x < -1 ).What about between ( -1 ) and ( 1 )? Since ( g(x) ) has a minimum at ( x = 0 ), let's evaluate ( g(0) ):( g(0) = (0)^2f(0) - 3(0)^2 = 0 - 0 = 0 )So, ( g(0) = 0 ), which is greater than ( -1 ). Therefore, at ( x = 0 ), the inequality ( g(x) > -1 ) holds.But wait, what about values between ( 0 ) and ( 1 )? Since ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ), and ( g(1) = -1 ), it must be that ( g(x) ) is less than ( -1 ) for ( x ) between ( 0 ) and ( 1 ). Wait, that contradicts ( g(0) = 0 ). Let me think.If ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ), starting from ( g(0) = 0 ), and reaching ( g(1) = -1 ), that would mean it's decreasing, not increasing. But earlier, I concluded ( g'(x) > 0 ) for ( x > 0 ), implying it's increasing.This seems contradictory. Maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let's double-check the derivative:( g'(x) = x(2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6) )Given that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ), so ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6 > 0 ). Therefore, ( g'(x) = x(text{positive}) ). For ( x > 0 ), ( g'(x) > 0 ), so ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ).But if ( g(0) = 0 ) and ( g(1) = -1 ), how can ( g(x) ) be increasing? It should go from 0 to -1, which is decreasing. That's a contradiction.Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ( g(1) ). Let me recalculate:( g(1) = (1)^2f(1) - 3(1)^2 = 1*2 - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 ). That seems correct.Wait, maybe I misapplied the derivative. Let me re-examine the derivative calculation.( g(x) = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 )Then,( g'(x) = 2xf(x) + x^2f'(x) - 6x )Factor out ( x ):( g'(x) = x(2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6) )Given that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ), so ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6 > 0 ). Therefore, ( g'(x) = x(text{positive}) ). For ( x > 0 ), ( g'(x) > 0 ), so ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ).But if ( g(0) = 0 ) and ( g(1) = -1 ), that would mean that ( g(x) ) decreases from 0 to -1 as ( x ) increases from 0 to 1, which contradicts the fact that ( g(x) ) is increasing.This suggests that my initial assumption or calculation might be wrong. Let me check the definition of ( g(x) ).I defined ( g(x) = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 ). The inequality ( x^2f(x) > 3x^2 - 1 ) leads to ( g(x) > -1 ). That seems correct.Wait, maybe I should consider the behavior of ( g(x) ) more carefully. If ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ), starting from ( g(0) = 0 ), then as ( x ) increases, ( g(x) ) should increase. But ( g(1) = -1 ), which is less than ( g(0) = 0 ). That can't happen if ( g(x) ) is increasing.This inconsistency suggests that perhaps my derivative calculation is incorrect or I misapplied the given condition.Wait, let's go back to the given condition: ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). So, ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6 > 0 ). Therefore, ( g'(x) = x(text{positive}) ). So, for ( x > 0 ), ( g'(x) > 0 ), meaning ( g(x) ) is increasing.But if ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ), starting from ( g(0) = 0 ), then ( g(x) ) should be greater than 0 for ( x > 0 ). But ( g(1) = -1 ), which is less than 0. That's a contradiction.This suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning. Maybe I misapplied the given condition or miscalculated the derivative.Wait, perhaps I should consider the given condition more carefully. The condition is ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). Let me write this as:( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 )This is a first-order linear differential inequality. Maybe I can solve the corresponding differential equation to find more information about ( f(x) ).The corresponding differential equation is:( 2f(x) + xf'(x) = 6 )Let me solve this ODE to find the general solution, which might help me understand the behavior of ( f(x) ).Rewriting the ODE:( xf'(x) + 2f(x) = 6 )This is a linear ODE of the form ( f'(x) + P(x)f(x) = Q(x) ). Let's write it in standard form:( f'(x) + (2/x)f(x) = 6/x )Here, ( P(x) = 2/x ) and ( Q(x) = 6/x ).The integrating factor ( mu(x) ) is:( mu(x) = e^{int P(x) dx} = e^{int (2/x) dx} = e^{2ln|x|} = x^2 )Multiply both sides of the ODE by ( mu(x) ):( x^2f'(x) + 2x f(x) = 6x )Notice that the left side is the derivative of ( x^2f(x) ):( frac{d}{dx}(x^2f(x)) = 6x )Integrate both sides:( x^2f(x) = int 6x dx = 3x^2 + C )Therefore,( f(x) = 3 + frac{C}{x^2} )But since ( f(x) ) is even, ( f(-x) = f(x) ). Let's check if this solution satisfies that.( f(-x) = 3 + frac{C}{(-x)^2} = 3 + frac{C}{x^2} = f(x) )Yes, it does. So, the general solution is ( f(x) = 3 + frac{C}{x^2} ).Now, we have the condition ( f(1) = 2 ). Let's use that to find ( C ):( f(1) = 3 + frac{C}{1^2} = 3 + C = 2 )So, ( C = 2 - 3 = -1 )Therefore, the specific solution is:( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} )Now, let's check if this satisfies the original differential inequality ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ).First, compute ( f'(x) ):( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} )( f'(x) = 0 - (-2)x^{-3} = frac{2}{x^3} )Now, compute ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ):( 2f(x) + xf'(x) = 2left(3 - frac{1}{x^2}right) + xleft(frac{2}{x^3}right) = 6 - frac{2}{x^2} + frac{2}{x^2} = 6 )Wait, that's exactly 6, not greater than 6. But the given condition is ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). So, this suggests that our solution ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ) satisfies the equality, not the inequality.This is a problem because the given condition is strict: ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). So, our solution doesn't satisfy the strict inequality. Therefore, perhaps the function ( f(x) ) is such that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) is slightly greater than 6, not exactly 6.Alternatively, maybe the general solution is ( f(x) = 3 + frac{C}{x^2} ), and we need to choose ( C ) such that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ).Let me compute ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) in terms of ( C ):( f(x) = 3 + frac{C}{x^2} )( f'(x) = -frac{2C}{x^3} )Then,( 2f(x) + xf'(x) = 2left(3 + frac{C}{x^2}right) + xleft(-frac{2C}{x^3}right) = 6 + frac{2C}{x^2} - frac{2C}{x^2} = 6 )Again, it's exactly 6, regardless of ( C ). So, no matter what ( C ) we choose, ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) = 6 ). But the given condition is ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). This suggests that our approach might be missing something.Perhaps the function ( f(x) ) is not exactly ( 3 + frac{C}{x^2} ), but something slightly different. Maybe there's a perturbation or another term that makes ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) greater than 6.Alternatively, maybe the function ( f(x) ) is such that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) is always greater than 6, but when we solve the equality, we get ( f(x) = 3 + frac{C}{x^2} ). So, perhaps the actual function ( f(x) ) is slightly larger than ( 3 + frac{C}{x^2} ) to make ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) greater than 6.But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the function ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ) and see if it leads to a consistent solution, even though it only satisfies the equality.Given that ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), let's compute ( g(x) = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 ):( g(x) = x^2left(3 - frac{1}{x^2}right) - 3x^2 = 3x^2 - 1 - 3x^2 = -1 )So, ( g(x) = -1 ) for all ( x neq 0 ). But we have ( g(0) = 0 ) as before.Wait, that's interesting. So, ( g(x) = -1 ) for all ( x neq 0 ), and ( g(0) = 0 ). Therefore, the inequality ( g(x) > -1 ) would hold only at ( x = 0 ), because for all other ( x ), ( g(x) = -1 ), which is not greater than -1.But this contradicts our earlier analysis where we thought ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ). It seems that with ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), ( g(x) ) is constant at -1 for all ( x neq 0 ).This suggests that perhaps the function ( f(x) ) is exactly ( 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), making ( g(x) = -1 ) for all ( x neq 0 ). But then, the inequality ( g(x) > -1 ) would only hold at ( x = 0 ).However, the problem states that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ), which is not satisfied by ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ) because it only equals 6. So, perhaps the function ( f(x) ) is slightly larger than ( 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), making ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) slightly larger than 6.If that's the case, then ( g'(x) = x(2f(x) + xf'(x) - 6) > 0 ) for ( x > 0 ), meaning ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ). Given that ( g(1) = -1 ), and ( g(x) ) is increasing, then for ( x > 1 ), ( g(x) > -1 ), and for ( x < 1 ), ( g(x) < -1 ).But wait, ( g(0) = 0 ), which is greater than -1. So, there's a contradiction here because if ( g(x) ) is increasing on ( (0, infty) ), starting from ( g(0) = 0 ), it should increase beyond that, but ( g(1) = -1 ), which is less than 0.This suggests that my initial assumption about the behavior of ( g(x) ) might be incorrect. Maybe ( g(x) ) has a minimum at some point other than 0.Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ), but since ( g(1) = -1 ), and ( g(0) = 0 ), it must be that ( g(x) ) decreases from 0 to -1 as ( x ) increases from 0 to 1, which contradicts the fact that ( g'(x) > 0 ).This is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Let me consider the inequality ( x^2f(x) > 3x^2 - 1 ). Rearranging, we get ( x^2(f(x) - 3) > -1 ). Let me define ( h(x) = f(x) - 3 ). Then the inequality becomes ( x^2h(x) > -1 ).Given that ( f(x) ) is even, ( h(x) = f(x) - 3 ) is also even.Now, let's look at the given condition ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). Substituting ( f(x) = h(x) + 3 ), we get:( 2(h(x) + 3) + x(h'(x) + 0) > 6 )Simplify:( 2h(x) + 6 + xh'(x) > 6 )Subtract 6 from both sides:( 2h(x) + xh'(x) > 0 )So, ( xh'(x) + 2h(x) > 0 )This is another differential inequality. Let's analyze this.For ( x > 0 ), we can write:( h'(x) + frac{2}{x}h(x) > 0 )This is a linear differential inequality. The corresponding homogeneous equation is:( h'(x) + frac{2}{x}h(x) = 0 )The integrating factor is:( mu(x) = e^{int frac{2}{x} dx} = e^{2ln x} = x^2 )Multiplying both sides by ( mu(x) ):( x^2h'(x) + 2xh(x) = 0 )Which is:( frac{d}{dx}(x^2h(x)) = 0 )Integrating:( x^2h(x) = C )So, ( h(x) = frac{C}{x^2} )But since ( h(x) = f(x) - 3 ), and ( f(x) ) is even, ( h(x) ) is also even, so ( C ) must be a constant.Given that ( f(1) = 2 ), ( h(1) = f(1) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 ). Therefore,( h(1) = frac{C}{1^2} = C = -1 )So, ( h(x) = -frac{1}{x^2} ), which implies ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} )But again, this leads us back to the same problem where ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) = 6 ), not greater than 6.This suggests that the function ( f(x) ) must be such that ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) ) is strictly greater than 6, which would mean that ( h(x) ) must be slightly larger than ( -frac{1}{x^2} ), making ( 2h(x) + xh'(x) > 0 ).But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should proceed with the function ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ) and see what the inequality ( x^2f(x) > 3x^2 - 1 ) becomes.Substituting ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ):( x^2left(3 - frac{1}{x^2}right) > 3x^2 - 1 )Simplify:( 3x^2 - 1 > 3x^2 - 1 )Which simplifies to:( -1 > -1 )Which is not true. So, the inequality ( x^2f(x) > 3x^2 - 1 ) is never satisfied for ( x neq 0 ) with this function.But we know that ( g(0) = 0 ), which is greater than -1, so the inequality holds at ( x = 0 ).This suggests that the only solution is ( x = 0 ). But that seems too restrictive.Wait, perhaps I need to consider that ( f(x) ) is slightly larger than ( 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), making ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ). If ( f(x) ) is larger, then ( g(x) = x^2f(x) - 3x^2 ) would be larger as well.Given that ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ), and ( g(1) = -1 ), then for ( x > 1 ), ( g(x) > -1 ), and for ( x < 1 ), ( g(x) < -1 ).But since ( g(x) ) is even, the same applies for ( x < -1 ). So, the inequality ( g(x) > -1 ) holds for ( |x| > 1 ).Additionally, at ( x = 0 ), ( g(0) = 0 > -1 ), so the inequality holds.Therefore, the solution set is ( x = 0 ) and ( |x| > 1 ), which is ( x < -1 ) or ( x > 1 ), or ( x = 0 ).But wait, earlier I thought ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ), starting from ( g(0) = 0 ), but with ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), ( g(x) = -1 ) for ( x neq 0 ). This inconsistency suggests that my analysis might be flawed.Perhaps I need to consider that ( f(x) ) is not exactly ( 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), but slightly larger, so that ( g(x) ) is increasing and crosses ( -1 ) at ( x = 1 ). Therefore, for ( x > 1 ), ( g(x) > -1 ), and for ( x < 1 ), ( g(x) < -1 ).Given that ( g(x) ) is even, the same applies for ( x < -1 ). So, the inequality ( g(x) > -1 ) holds for ( |x| > 1 ) and at ( x = 0 ).Therefore, the solution set is ( x = 0 ) or ( |x| > 1 ), which can be written as ( x < -1 ) or ( x > 1 ), or ( x = 0 ).But I'm still a bit confused because when I plug in ( f(x) = 3 - frac{1}{x^2} ), the inequality doesn't hold except at ( x = 0 ). However, if ( f(x) ) is slightly larger, then ( g(x) ) would be slightly larger than -1 for ( x > 1 ) and ( x < -1 ).So, considering the given condition ( 2f(x) + xf'(x) > 6 ), which implies that ( g(x) ) is increasing for ( x > 0 ), and knowing that ( g(1) = -1 ), the inequality ( g(x) > -1 ) must hold for ( x > 1 ) and ( x < -1 ), as well as at ( x = 0 ).Therefore, the solution set is all real numbers ( x ) such that ( x = 0 ) or ( |x| > 1 )."},{"question":"The point P lies on the side  CD  of the parallelogram  ABCD  with  angle DBA = angle CBP . Point  O  is the center of the circle passing through the points  D  and  P  and tangent to the straight line  AD  at point  D . Prove that  AO = OC .","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about a parallelogram ABCD. Point P is on side CD, and there's this condition that angle DBA is equal to angle CBP. Then, there's a point O, which is the center of a circle that passes through points D and P and is tangent to the line AD at point D. I need to prove that AO equals OC. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me visualize the parallelogram ABCD. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so AB is parallel and equal to CD, and AD is parallel and equal to BC. Now, point P is somewhere on side CD. The condition given is that angle DBA is equal to angle CBP. That seems important. Maybe I can use some triangle properties or angle relationships here.Since ABCD is a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Maybe I should focus on the angles first. So, angle DBA equals angle CBP. Let me denote angle DBA as x, so angle CBP is also x. That might help in setting up some equations or similar triangles.Now, point O is the center of the circle passing through D and P and tangent to AD at D. Tangent at D means that the radius at point D is perpendicular to AD. Since O is the center, OD is the radius, so OD is perpendicular to AD. That gives me a right angle at D between OD and AD.So, OD is perpendicular to AD. That might help in figuring out the coordinates or the position of O relative to the parallelogram. Maybe coordinate geometry could be a good approach here. Let me try assigning coordinates to the points to make things more concrete.Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a parallelogram, let me assign coordinates as follows:- A: (0,0)- B: (a,0)- D: (0,b)- C: (a,b)So, side AB is from (0,0) to (a,0), AD is from (0,0) to (0,b), and so on. Now, point P is on CD. Since CD goes from (a,b) to (0,b), any point P on CD can be represented as (p, b), where p is between 0 and a.Given that angle DBA equals angle CBP, let me try to express these angles in terms of coordinates. Angle DBA is the angle at point B between points D and A. Similarly, angle CBP is the angle at point B between points C and P.Wait, maybe using vectors or slopes could help here. Let me compute the slopes of the lines involved.First, the slope of BD: points B(a,0) to D(0,b). The slope is (b - 0)/(0 - a) = -b/a.Similarly, the slope of BP: points B(a,0) to P(p,b). The slope is (b - 0)/(p - a) = b/(p - a).Given that angle DBA equals angle CBP, which are angles at point B. Maybe I can use the tangent of these angles, which would relate to the slopes.The tangent of angle DBA would be the absolute value of the difference of slopes divided by (1 plus the product of slopes). Wait, actually, the tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|.So, for angle DBA, the two lines are BA and BD. BA is from B(a,0) to A(0,0), which is along the x-axis, so its slope is 0. BD is from B(a,0) to D(0,b), slope is -b/a.So, tan(angle DBA) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = |(-b/a - 0)/(1 + 0)| = | -b/a | = b/a.Similarly, angle CBP is the angle between BC and BP. BC is from B(a,0) to C(a,b), which is vertical, so its slope is undefined. BP is from B(a,0) to P(p,b), slope is b/(p - a).Hmm, dealing with a vertical line complicates things. Maybe I should approach this differently.Alternatively, since BC is vertical, the angle CBP is the angle between the vertical line BC and the line BP. So, the tangent of angle CBP would be the horizontal change over the vertical change from B to P.From B(a,0) to P(p,b), the horizontal change is (p - a) and the vertical change is b. So, tan(angle CBP) = |(p - a)/b|.Given that angle DBA equals angle CBP, their tangents should be equal. So,tan(angle DBA) = tan(angle CBP)b/a = |(p - a)/b|Since p is between 0 and a, (p - a) is negative, so |(p - a)/b| = (a - p)/b.Therefore,b/a = (a - p)/bCross-multiplying:b^2 = a(a - p)So,b^2 = a^2 - a pTherefore,a p = a^2 - b^2So,p = (a^2 - b^2)/a = a - (b^2)/aOkay, so p is determined in terms of a and b. So, point P has coordinates (a - (b^2)/a, b).Alright, that's a good start. Now, moving on to the circle passing through D and P and tangent to AD at D. Let's recall that the circle is tangent to AD at D, so the radius at D is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,b)), the tangent at D is horizontal. Therefore, the radius OD is horizontal. So, OD is horizontal, meaning that the center O lies somewhere on the horizontal line passing through D, which is y = b.Wait, no. Wait, AD is vertical, so the tangent at D is horizontal. Therefore, the radius OD is perpendicular to AD, which is vertical, so OD must be horizontal. Therefore, the center O lies somewhere on the horizontal line passing through D, which is y = b. So, the y-coordinate of O is b.But wait, point D is at (0,b), and the circle passes through D and P, which is at (a - (b^2)/a, b). So, both D and P are on the circle, and the center O is somewhere on y = b.Wait, that seems interesting. So, if both D and P are on the circle, and the center is on y = b, then the circle is centered at (h, b) for some h. The distance from O to D must equal the distance from O to P.So, distance from O(h, b) to D(0, b) is |h - 0| = |h|.Distance from O(h, b) to P(a - (b^2)/a, b) is |h - (a - (b^2)/a)|.Since these distances are equal,|h| = |h - (a - (b^2)/a)|Let me solve this equation for h.Case 1: h >= 0Then,h = |h - (a - (b^2)/a)|So, two possibilities:Subcase 1a: h - (a - (b^2)/a) >= 0Then,h = h - (a - (b^2)/a)Which simplifies to 0 = - (a - (b^2)/a), which implies a - (b^2)/a = 0, so a^2 = b^2, which would mean a = b (since lengths are positive). But in a parallelogram, a and b can be different, so this might not hold unless it's a rhombus. But the problem doesn't specify that, so this might not be the case.Subcase 1b: h - (a - (b^2)/a) < 0Then,h = -(h - (a - (b^2)/a)) = -h + (a - (b^2)/a)Bringing h to the left,2h = a - (b^2)/aThus,h = (a/2) - (b^2)/(2a)Case 2: h < 0Then,|h| = -hSo,-h = |h - (a - (b^2)/a)|Again, two possibilities:Subcase 2a: h - (a - (b^2)/a) >= 0Then,-h = h - (a - (b^2)/a)Bringing h to the left,-2h = - (a - (b^2)/a)Multiply both sides by -1,2h = a - (b^2)/aSo,h = (a/2) - (b^2)/(2a)But in this case, h < 0, so we have:(a/2) - (b^2)/(2a) < 0Which implies,a/2 < (b^2)/(2a)Multiply both sides by 2a (positive),a^2 < b^2So,a < bBut in a parallelogram, sides can be of any length, so this is possible. However, in our earlier assumption, we set point P on CD, which is from (a,b) to (0,b). If a < b, then the coordinates might still hold, but let's see.Subcase 2b: h - (a - (b^2)/a) < 0Then,-h = -(h - (a - (b^2)/a)) = -h + (a - (b^2)/a)Adding h to both sides,0 = (a - (b^2)/a)Which again implies a^2 = b^2, so a = b.But this is similar to Subcase 1a, which only holds if a = b, which is not necessarily the case.Therefore, the only valid solution is h = (a/2) - (b^2)/(2a). So, the center O is at ((a/2) - (b^2)/(2a), b).Simplify h:h = (a^2 - b^2)/(2a)So, O is at ((a^2 - b^2)/(2a), b).Alright, now I need to find AO and OC and show that they are equal.Point A is at (0,0), and point O is at ((a^2 - b^2)/(2a), b). So, the distance AO is the distance between these two points.Compute AO:AO = sqrt[ ( ( (a^2 - b^2)/(2a) - 0 )^2 + (b - 0)^2 ) ]Simplify:= sqrt[ ( (a^2 - b^2)^2 / (4a^2) ) + b^2 ]Similarly, point C is at (a, b). So, distance OC is the distance between O((a^2 - b^2)/(2a), b) and C(a, b).Compute OC:OC = sqrt[ ( a - (a^2 - b^2)/(2a) )^2 + (b - b)^2 ]Simplify:= sqrt[ ( (2a^2 - a^2 + b^2)/(2a) )^2 + 0 ]= sqrt[ ( (a^2 + b^2)/(2a) )^2 ]= (a^2 + b^2)/(2a)Now, let's compute AO:AO = sqrt[ ( (a^2 - b^2)^2 / (4a^2) ) + b^2 ]Let me compute the expression inside the square root:= (a^4 - 2a^2b^2 + b^4)/(4a^2) + b^2= (a^4 - 2a^2b^2 + b^4 + 4a^2b^2)/(4a^2)= (a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4)/(4a^2)Notice that the numerator is (a^2 + b^2)^2.So,= (a^2 + b^2)^2 / (4a^2)Therefore,AO = sqrt[ (a^2 + b^2)^2 / (4a^2) ) ] = (a^2 + b^2)/(2a)Which is the same as OC.Therefore, AO = OC.So, I've shown that AO equals OC by computing their distances using coordinates. It seems that regardless of the specific values of a and b (as long as they satisfy the given conditions), AO and OC are equal. Therefore, the proof is complete.**Final Answer**boxed{AO = OC}"},{"question":"Given a sequence {a_{n}} that satisfies {a}_{n+1}={a}_{n}^{2}+k,n∈{N}_{+},k∈R.<br/>(1) If a_{1}=1 and the sequence {a_{n}} is an increasing sequence, find the range of real number k;<br/>(2) If a_{1}=3 and k=0, find the general formula of the sequence {a_{n}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence problem here, and I need to solve two parts.

We're given that ( a_1 = 1 ) and that the sequence is increasing.

Let me check the next term to see if there's any additional constraint.Compute ( a_3 ):( a_3 = a_2^2 + k = (1 + k)^2 + k = 1 + 2k + k^2 + k = 1 + 3k + k^2 ).Since the sequence is increasing, ( a_3 > a_2 ):( 1 + 3k + k^2 > 1 + k ).Subtracting ( 1 + k ) from both sides:( 2k + k^2 > 0 ).Factor out ( k ):( k(k + 2) > 0 ).Now, since ( k > 0 ) from the first condition, and ( k + 2 ) is always positive when ( k > 0 ), the product is positive. So this doesn't give us any new information. It just confirms that ( k > 0 ) is sufficient for ( a_3 > a_2 ).Let me check ( a_4 ) to see if there's any further restriction.( a_4 = a_3^2 + k = (1 + 3k + k^2)^2 + k ).Expanding this would be a bit messy, but I can see that as ( n ) increases, each term is the square of the previous term plus ( k ). Since ( a_n ) is increasing, each subsequent term will be significantly larger than the previous one, especially since we're squaring each time.But since ( k > 0 ), each term will keep getting larger because we're adding a positive ( k ) each time. So, it seems that as long as ( k > 0 ), the sequence will keep increasing.Wait, but is there an upper limit on ( k )? For example, if ( k ) is too large, could the sequence diverge or something? But in this case, since we're just adding ( k ) each time after squaring, which is a very fast-growing function, I don't think ( k ) being too large would cause any issues. The sequence would just grow faster.Therefore, I think the only condition needed is ( k > 0 ). So, the range of ( k ) is all positive real numbers.Moving on to part (2). Here, we have ( a_1 = 3 ) and ( k = 0 ). We need to find the general formula for the sequence ( {a_n} ).Given ( a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + 0 = a_n^2 ), so each term is the square of the previous term. Starting with ( a_1 = 3 ), let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern.( a_1 = 3 )( a_2 = 3^2 = 9 )( a_3 = 9^2 = 81 )( a_4 = 81^2 = 6561 )Hmm, so each term is 3 raised to a power that doubles each time. Let's see:( a_1 = 3 = 3^{2^0} )( a_2 = 9 = 3^{2^1} )( a_3 = 81 = 3^{2^2} )( a_4 = 6561 = 3^{2^3} )So, it looks like ( a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} ). Let me test this formula.For ( n = 1 ):( 3^{2^{0}} = 3^1 = 3 ). Correct.For ( n = 2 ):( 3^{2^{1}} = 3^2 = 9 ). Correct.For ( n = 3 ):( 3^{2^{2}} = 3^4 = 81 ). Correct.For ( n = 4 ):( 3^{2^{3}} = 3^8 = 6561 ). Correct.So, the general formula seems to be ( a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} ).Alternatively, this can be written using exponents of exponents, but I think ( 3^{2^{n-1}} ) is the simplest form.Let me see if I can derive this more formally. Since each term is the square of the previous term, we can write:( a_{n} = (a_{n-1})^2 )( a_{n-1} = (a_{n-2})^2 )Substituting back:( a_n = ((a_{n-2})^2)^2 = (a_{n-2})^{2^2} )Continuing this way, each substitution squares the exponent:( a_n = (a_{n-3})^{2^3} )And so on, until we get to:( a_n = (a_1)^{2^{n-1}} )Since ( a_1 = 3 ), this becomes:( a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} )Yes, that's a solid derivation. So, the general formula is indeed ( a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} ).I think that's it for both parts. For part (1), ( k ) must be positive, and for part (2), the general term is ( 3 ) raised to the power of ( 2^{n-1} ).**Final Answer**(1) The range of ( k ) is boxed{(0, +infty)}.(2) The general formula is boxed{a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}}}."},{"question":"In a quadratic equation with integer coefficients, the sum of the coefficients of the terms containing the variable is an even number, and the constant term (the term not containing the variable) is an odd number. Prove that if the equation has a rational root, the simplest form of this root will have an even denominator.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation with integer coefficients. The problem says that the sum of the coefficients of the terms containing the variable is even, and the constant term is odd. I need to prove that if the equation has a rational root, then the simplest form of this root will have an even denominator.Alright, let me start by writing down the quadratic equation. It's in the form:[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ]Here, ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are integers. The sum of the coefficients of the terms with the variable is ( a + b ), and this sum is even. Also, the constant term ( c ) is odd.Now, I need to consider the possibility of a rational root. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root, when expressed in its simplest form ( frac{p}{q} ), must have ( p ) as a factor of the constant term ( c ) and ( q ) as a factor of the leading coefficient ( a ). So, ( p ) divides ( c ) and ( q ) divides ( a ).Since ( c ) is odd, all its factors ( p ) must also be odd. Similarly, ( a ) could be either even or odd, but since ( a + b ) is even, if ( a ) is even, ( b ) must also be even, and if ( a ) is odd, ( b ) must also be odd.Let me assume that ( frac{p}{q} ) is a root of the equation. Then, substituting ( x = frac{p}{q} ) into the equation gives:[ aleft(frac{p}{q}right)^2 + bleft(frac{p}{q}right) + c = 0 ]Multiplying both sides by ( q^2 ) to eliminate the denominators:[ a p^2 + b p q + c q^2 = 0 ]So, the equation simplifies to:[ a p^2 + b p q + c q^2 = 0 ]Now, I need to analyze the parity (whether each term is even or odd) of each term in this equation.First, let's recall that ( c ) is odd, so ( c q^2 ) will be odd if ( q ) is odd, and even if ( q ) is even.Next, consider ( a p^2 ) and ( b p q ). Since ( p ) is a factor of ( c ), and ( c ) is odd, ( p ) must be odd. Therefore, ( p^2 ) is also odd, and ( p q ) will be odd if ( q ) is odd, and even if ( q ) is even.Now, let's analyze the sum ( a p^2 + b p q ). Remember that ( a + b ) is even. There are two cases:1. Both ( a ) and ( b ) are even.2. Both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd.**Case 1: Both ( a ) and ( b ) are even.**If ( a ) and ( b ) are even, then ( a p^2 ) and ( b p q ) are both even because they are products of even numbers. So, their sum ( a p^2 + b p q ) is even.Now, looking at the entire equation:- If ( q ) is odd, then ( c q^2 ) is odd (since ( c ) is odd and ( q^2 ) is odd).- Therefore, ( a p^2 + b p q + c q^2 ) is even + odd = odd.But the equation equals zero, which is even. So, we have an odd number equal to an even number, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( q ) cannot be odd in this case.**Case 2: Both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd.**If ( a ) and ( b ) are odd, let's see what happens with ( a p^2 ) and ( b p q ).- ( a p^2 ): ( a ) is odd, ( p^2 ) is odd (since ( p ) is odd), so ( a p^2 ) is odd.- ( b p q ): ( b ) is odd, ( p ) is odd, so ( p q ) is odd if ( q ) is odd, and even if ( q ) is even.Therefore:- If ( q ) is odd, ( b p q ) is odd, so ( a p^2 + b p q ) is odd + odd = even.- Then, ( c q^2 ) is odd (since ( c ) is odd and ( q^2 ) is odd).- So, the entire equation becomes even + odd = odd, which again contradicts the equation being zero (even).- If ( q ) is even, ( b p q ) is even (since ( q ) is even), so ( a p^2 + b p q ) is odd + even = odd.- Then, ( c q^2 ) is even (since ( q^2 ) is even).- So, the entire equation becomes odd + even = odd, which again contradicts the equation being zero.Wait, that doesn't make sense. If both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd, regardless of whether ( q ) is odd or even, the sum ( a p^2 + b p q + c q^2 ) is odd, which can't be zero. So, does that mean there are no rational roots in this case?But the problem states that if there is a rational root, then the denominator must be even. So, maybe in the case where both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd, there are no rational roots, which is consistent with the conclusion.But let me double-check.Wait, in Case 2, if ( q ) is even, then ( c q^2 ) is even, and ( a p^2 + b p q ) is odd + even = odd. So, odd + even = odd, which is not zero. If ( q ) is odd, then ( a p^2 + b p q ) is even, and ( c q^2 ) is odd, so even + odd = odd, which is still not zero.Therefore, in Case 2, regardless of ( q ) being even or odd, the sum is odd, which can't be zero. Therefore, there are no rational roots when both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd.But the problem says that if the equation has a rational root, then the denominator is even. So, in the case where ( a ) and ( b ) are both even, we saw that if ( q ) is odd, we get a contradiction, so ( q ) must be even.In the case where ( a ) and ( b ) are both odd, there are no rational roots, so the condition is vacuously true.Therefore, in the only case where there can be a rational root (when ( a ) and ( b ) are both even), the denominator ( q ) must be even.So, putting it all together, if the quadratic equation has a rational root, the denominator in the simplest form must be even.I think that covers all the cases. I might have made a mistake in the parity analysis, but it seems consistent. Let me just recap:- If ( a + b ) is even, either both are even or both are odd.- If both are even, then ( q ) must be even to avoid a contradiction.- If both are odd, there are no rational roots.- Therefore, any rational root must have an even denominator.Yeah, that makes sense. I think I've got it."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = |ln(x-1)|, and f(a) > f(4-a), what is the range of the real number a?A: (1, 2)B: (2, 3)C: (1, 3)D: (2, 4)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given the function f(x) = |ln(x - 1)|, and we're told that f(a) > f(4 - a). We need to find the range of the real number a. The options are A: (1, 2), B: (2, 3), C: (1, 3), D: (2, 4). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand the function f(x) = |ln(x - 1)|. The absolute value of the natural logarithm of (x - 1). So, this function is defined when the argument inside the logarithm is positive, meaning x - 1 > 0, so x > 1. That gives me the domain of f(x) as (1, ∞).Now, the function is the absolute value of ln(x - 1). So, let me think about what that looks like. The natural logarithm function, ln(x), is negative for 0 < x < 1 and positive for x > 1. But in this case, since we have ln(x - 1), the function ln(x - 1) will be negative when x - 1 < 1, which means x < 2, and positive when x > 2. So, |ln(x - 1)| will be equal to -ln(x - 1) when x is between 1 and 2, and equal to ln(x - 1) when x is greater than or equal to 2.So, f(x) can be written as a piecewise function:- f(x) = -ln(x - 1) for 1 < x < 2- f(x) = ln(x - 1) for x ≥ 2Alright, so now I know the behavior of f(x). It's decreasing on (1, 2) because the derivative of -ln(x - 1) is -1/(x - 1), which is negative, so the function is decreasing. Then, for x ≥ 2, f(x) = ln(x - 1), whose derivative is 1/(x - 1), which is positive, so the function is increasing on (2, ∞).So, f(x) decreases from x = 1 to x = 2 and then increases from x = 2 onwards.Now, the problem states that f(a) > f(4 - a). So, I need to find the values of a where this inequality holds.First, let's determine the domain of a. Since f(x) is defined for x > 1, both a and 4 - a must be greater than 1.So, for a:- a > 1- 4 - a > 1 ⇒ 4 - a > 1 ⇒ -a > -3 ⇒ a < 3So, combining these two, a must be in (1, 3). So, the possible range of a is between 1 and 3. That already tells me that option C: (1, 3) is a possible range, but we need to see if it's the correct one or if it's narrower.Now, let's analyze f(a) > f(4 - a). Since f(x) is defined piecewise, I need to consider different cases based on where a and 4 - a fall in the domain.Case 1: Both a and 4 - a are in (1, 2). So, if a is in (1, 2), then 4 - a would be in (2, 3). Wait, because if a is 1.5, 4 - a is 2.5. So, if a is in (1, 2), 4 - a is in (2, 3). So, in this case, f(a) is -ln(a - 1) and f(4 - a) is ln((4 - a) - 1) = ln(3 - a).So, the inequality becomes:-ln(a - 1) > ln(3 - a)Let me write that down:-ln(a - 1) > ln(3 - a)I can rewrite -ln(a - 1) as ln(1/(a - 1)), so:ln(1/(a - 1)) > ln(3 - a)Since ln is a monotonically increasing function, the inequality of the logarithms implies the inequality of their arguments:1/(a - 1) > 3 - aSo, 1/(a - 1) > 3 - aLet me solve this inequality. First, note that a is in (1, 2), so a - 1 is positive, and 3 - a is also positive because a < 3, which is already satisfied since a < 2.So, I can multiply both sides by (a - 1) without changing the inequality direction:1 > (3 - a)(a - 1)Let me compute (3 - a)(a - 1):(3 - a)(a - 1) = 3(a - 1) - a(a - 1) = 3a - 3 - a² + a = (3a + a) - 3 - a² = 4a - 3 - a²So, 1 > 4a - 3 - a²Let me rearrange this:a² - 4a + 4 < 0Wait, let's see:1 > -a² + 4a - 3Bring all terms to the left:0 > -a² + 4a - 3 - 10 > -a² + 4a - 4Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):0 < a² - 4a + 4So, a² - 4a + 4 > 0Factor the quadratic:a² - 4a + 4 = (a - 2)²So, (a - 2)² > 0This inequality holds for all real numbers except a = 2, where it's equal to zero.But in this case, a is in (1, 2). So, (a - 2)² is always positive in this interval, so the inequality holds for all a in (1, 2). Wait, but that seems contradictory because earlier, when I set up the inequality, I thought there might be specific solutions.Wait, let me double-check my steps.Starting from:1/(a - 1) > 3 - aMultiply both sides by (a - 1):1 > (3 - a)(a - 1)Which led to:1 > -a² + 4a - 3Then:0 > -a² + 4a - 4Multiply by -1:0 < a² - 4a + 4Which is (a - 2)² > 0So, yes, that's correct. So, in this case, for a in (1, 2), the inequality f(a) > f(4 - a) reduces to (a - 2)² > 0, which is always true except at a = 2, which isn't in this interval. So, in this case, for all a in (1, 2), f(a) > f(4 - a).Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because f(a) is decreasing on (1, 2) and f(4 - a) is increasing on (2, 3). So, as a increases from 1 to 2, 4 - a decreases from 3 to 2. So, f(a) is decreasing, and f(4 - a) is increasing. So, maybe the inequality holds throughout?But let me test with specific values.Let me pick a = 1.5, which is in (1, 2). Then, 4 - a = 2.5, which is in (2, 3).Compute f(a) = |ln(1.5 - 1)| = |ln(0.5)| = | -ln(2) | = ln(2) ≈ 0.693Compute f(4 - a) = |ln(2.5 - 1)| = |ln(1.5)| ≈ 0.405So, f(a) ≈ 0.693 > f(4 - a) ≈ 0.405. So, the inequality holds.Another test: a = 1.1, 4 - a = 2.9f(a) = |ln(0.1)| = | -2.302 | = 2.302f(4 - a) = |ln(1.9)| ≈ 0.6419So, 2.302 > 0.6419, which holds.Another test: a approaching 2 from the left, say a = 1.99f(a) = |ln(0.99)| ≈ | -0.01005 | ≈ 0.01005f(4 - a) = |ln(2.01)| ≈ 0.703Wait, hold on, 0.01005 is not greater than 0.703. So, in this case, f(a) < f(4 - a). That contradicts my earlier conclusion.Hmm, so something's wrong here. Let me check my calculations.Wait, when a approaches 2 from the left, 4 - a approaches 2 from the right. So, f(a) = |ln(a - 1)| = |ln(1.99 - 1)| = |ln(0.99)| ≈ 0.01005f(4 - a) = |ln(2.01 - 1)| = |ln(1.01)| ≈ 0.00995Wait, 0.01005 > 0.00995, so actually, f(a) is still slightly greater than f(4 - a). So, in this case, the inequality holds.Wait, but when a is 1.99, 4 - a is 2.01, so f(a) is |ln(0.99)| ≈ 0.01005, and f(4 - a) is |ln(1.01)| ≈ 0.00995. So, 0.01005 > 0.00995, so f(a) > f(4 - a).Wait, but when a is 1.99, 4 - a is 2.01, so f(a) is |ln(0.99)| ≈ 0.01005, and f(4 - a) is |ln(1.01)| ≈ 0.00995. So, 0.01005 > 0.00995, so f(a) > f(4 - a).Wait, but when a is 1.5, f(a) is ln(2) ≈ 0.693, and f(4 - a) is ln(1.5) ≈ 0.405, so f(a) > f(4 - a).When a approaches 1, say a = 1.1, f(a) is |ln(0.1)| ≈ 2.302, and f(4 - a) is |ln(2.9)| ≈ 1.064, so f(a) > f(4 - a).Wait, but when a approaches 2 from the left, f(a) approaches |ln(1)| = 0, and f(4 - a) approaches |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693. Wait, no, when a approaches 2 from the left, 4 - a approaches 2 from the right, so f(4 - a) approaches |ln(1)| = 0. So, actually, as a approaches 2 from the left, f(a) approaches 0, and f(4 - a) approaches 0 as well.Wait, but let me compute f(a) and f(4 - a) when a is 1.99:f(a) = |ln(1.99 - 1)| = |ln(0.99)| ≈ 0.01005f(4 - a) = |ln(2.01 - 1)| = |ln(1.01)| ≈ 0.00995So, f(a) is slightly larger than f(4 - a). So, the inequality holds.Wait, but when a is exactly 2, f(a) = |ln(1)| = 0, and f(4 - a) = |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693, so f(a) < f(4 - a). But a = 2 is not in the interval (1, 2), it's the boundary.So, in the interval (1, 2), f(a) > f(4 - a) holds for all a in (1, 2).Wait, but earlier when I thought about a approaching 2, I thought f(a) was approaching 0, and f(4 - a) was approaching 0, but actually, f(4 - a) when a approaches 2 from the left is approaching |ln(1)| = 0, so both approach 0, but f(a) is slightly larger.Wait, but let me think about this again. When a is in (1, 2), 4 - a is in (2, 3). So, f(a) is decreasing from ln(1) = 0 to ln(1) = 0, but actually, f(a) is |ln(x - 1)|, so when x approaches 1 from the right, ln(x - 1) approaches -infty, so |ln(x - 1)| approaches +infty. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when x approaches 1 from the right, x - 1 approaches 0 from the right, so ln(x - 1) approaches -infty, so |ln(x - 1)| approaches +infty. So, f(x) approaches +infty as x approaches 1 from the right.Wait, so when a approaches 1 from the right, f(a) approaches +infty, and f(4 - a) approaches |ln(3 - 1)| = |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693. So, f(a) is much larger than f(4 - a) near a = 1.As a increases towards 2, f(a) decreases towards 0, and f(4 - a) increases from |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693 towards |ln(1)| = 0. Wait, no, when a approaches 2 from the left, 4 - a approaches 2 from the right, so f(4 - a) approaches |ln(1)| = 0.Wait, so f(a) is decreasing from +infty to 0 as a goes from 1 to 2, and f(4 - a) is decreasing from |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693 to 0 as a goes from 1 to 2.Wait, no, when a increases from 1 to 2, 4 - a decreases from 3 to 2, so f(4 - a) is |ln((4 - a) - 1)| = |ln(3 - a)|. As a increases from 1 to 2, 3 - a decreases from 2 to 1, so ln(3 - a) decreases from ln(2) ≈ 0.693 to ln(1) = 0. So, f(4 - a) decreases from 0.693 to 0.So, f(a) is decreasing from +infty to 0, and f(4 - a) is decreasing from 0.693 to 0. So, f(a) starts much larger than f(4 - a) and remains larger throughout the interval (1, 2). So, f(a) > f(4 - a) holds for all a in (1, 2).Wait, but earlier when I thought about a = 1.99, f(a) was 0.01005 and f(4 - a) was 0.00995, so f(a) is still slightly larger. So, in this case, the inequality holds for all a in (1, 2).Now, let's consider the next case.Case 2: a is in (2, 3). So, a is greater than 2 but less than 3. Then, 4 - a would be in (1, 2), because if a is 2.5, 4 - a is 1.5.So, in this case, f(a) = ln(a - 1) because a ≥ 2, and f(4 - a) = -ln((4 - a) - 1) = -ln(3 - a) because 4 - a is in (1, 2).So, the inequality f(a) > f(4 - a) becomes:ln(a - 1) > -ln(3 - a)Let me rewrite this:ln(a - 1) + ln(3 - a) > 0Because I can add ln(3 - a) to both sides:ln(a - 1) > -ln(3 - a)ln(a - 1) + ln(3 - a) > 0Using logarithm properties, ln(a - 1) + ln(3 - a) = ln((a - 1)(3 - a))So, ln((a - 1)(3 - a)) > 0Which implies that:(a - 1)(3 - a) > 1Because ln(x) > 0 when x > 1.So, (a - 1)(3 - a) > 1Let me expand the left side:(a - 1)(3 - a) = -a² + 4a - 3So, the inequality becomes:-a² + 4a - 3 > 1Bring 1 to the left:-a² + 4a - 4 > 0Multiply both sides by -1 (which reverses the inequality):a² - 4a + 4 < 0Factor the quadratic:(a - 2)² < 0But (a - 2)² is always non-negative, so the inequality (a - 2)² < 0 has no solution.Wait, that can't be right. So, in this case, there is no solution for a in (2, 3) where f(a) > f(4 - a). But that contradicts my earlier thought.Wait, let me check my steps again.Starting from:ln(a - 1) > -ln(3 - a)Which can be rewritten as:ln(a - 1) + ln(3 - a) > 0Which is:ln((a - 1)(3 - a)) > 0So, (a - 1)(3 - a) > 1Expanding:(a - 1)(3 - a) = -a² + 4a - 3So, -a² + 4a - 3 > 1Bring 1 to the left:-a² + 4a - 4 > 0Multiply by -1:a² - 4a + 4 < 0Which is (a - 2)² < 0Which has no solution because a square is always non-negative.So, in this case, for a in (2, 3), there is no solution where f(a) > f(4 - a). So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.Wait, but let me test with a specific value. Let me pick a = 2.5, which is in (2, 3). Then, 4 - a = 1.5, which is in (1, 2).Compute f(a) = |ln(2.5 - 1)| = |ln(1.5)| ≈ 0.405Compute f(4 - a) = |ln(1.5 - 1)| = |ln(0.5)| = ln(2) ≈ 0.693So, f(a) ≈ 0.405 < f(4 - a) ≈ 0.693. So, the inequality does not hold here.Another test: a = 2.1, 4 - a = 1.9f(a) = |ln(1.1)| ≈ 0.0953f(4 - a) = |ln(0.9)| ≈ 0.1054So, f(a) ≈ 0.0953 < f(4 - a) ≈ 0.1054. So, inequality does not hold.Another test: a approaching 2 from the right, say a = 2.01f(a) = |ln(1.01)| ≈ 0.00995f(4 - a) = |ln(1.99)| ≈ 0.01005So, f(a) ≈ 0.00995 < f(4 - a) ≈ 0.01005. So, inequality does not hold.Wait, but when a approaches 3 from the left, say a = 2.99f(a) = |ln(1.99)| ≈ 0.01005f(4 - a) = |ln(1.01)| ≈ 0.00995So, f(a) ≈ 0.01005 > f(4 - a) ≈ 0.00995. So, in this case, f(a) > f(4 - a).Wait, that's interesting. So, near a = 3, f(a) is slightly larger than f(4 - a). So, maybe there's a point where the inequality flips.Wait, let me think about this. When a is in (2, 3), f(a) = ln(a - 1) and f(4 - a) = -ln(3 - a). So, the inequality is ln(a - 1) > -ln(3 - a).Let me rewrite this as:ln(a - 1) + ln(3 - a) > 0Which is:ln((a - 1)(3 - a)) > 0So, (a - 1)(3 - a) > 1Which simplifies to:-a² + 4a - 3 > 1-a² + 4a - 4 > 0a² - 4a + 4 < 0(a - 2)² < 0Which has no solution, as before.But wait, when a approaches 3 from the left, (a - 1)(3 - a) approaches (2)(0) = 0, which is less than 1. So, the inequality (a - 1)(3 - a) > 1 is not satisfied.Wait, but when a is exactly 2, (a - 1)(3 - a) = (1)(1) = 1, which is equal to 1. So, at a = 2, (a - 1)(3 - a) = 1, so ln(1) = 0, so the inequality ln((a - 1)(3 - a)) > 0 becomes 0 > 0, which is false.Wait, but when a is slightly greater than 2, say a = 2.1, (a - 1)(3 - a) = (1.1)(0.9) = 0.99, which is less than 1, so ln(0.99) ≈ -0.01 < 0, so the inequality does not hold.When a approaches 3 from the left, (a - 1)(3 - a) approaches 0, so ln(0) is undefined, but approaching from the left, it's negative infinity, so the inequality does not hold.Wait, but earlier when I tested a = 2.99, f(a) was slightly larger than f(4 - a). Let me compute (a - 1)(3 - a) when a = 2.99:(2.99 - 1)(3 - 2.99) = (1.99)(0.01) = 0.0199So, ln(0.0199) ≈ -4.00, which is less than 0, so the inequality ln((a - 1)(3 - a)) > 0 is not satisfied.Wait, but f(a) = ln(a - 1) ≈ ln(1.99) ≈ 0.693f(4 - a) = |ln(0.01)| ≈ 4.605Wait, no, wait, when a = 2.99, 4 - a = 1.01So, f(4 - a) = |ln(1.01 - 1)| = |ln(0.01)| ≈ 4.605Wait, that's a big number. So, f(a) ≈ 0.693 < f(4 - a) ≈ 4.605. So, the inequality does not hold.Wait, but earlier when I thought a = 2.99, f(a) was 0.01005 and f(4 - a) was 0.00995, but that was a mistake because when a = 2.99, 4 - a = 1.01, so f(4 - a) = |ln(0.01)| ≈ 4.605, not 0.00995.Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought a = 2.99, 4 - a = 1.01, so f(4 - a) = |ln(0.01)| ≈ 4.605, which is much larger than f(a) ≈ 0.693.So, in reality, for a in (2, 3), f(a) is less than f(4 - a), except perhaps near a = 2, but even there, as we saw, f(a) is slightly less than f(4 - a).Wait, but when a approaches 2 from the right, f(a) approaches |ln(1)| = 0, and f(4 - a) approaches |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693, so f(a) < f(4 - a).Wait, so in this case, for a in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a), so the inequality f(a) > f(4 - a) does not hold.Wait, but earlier when I thought about a = 2.99, I thought f(a) was slightly larger, but that was a mistake because I miscalculated f(4 - a). So, in reality, for a in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a).So, putting it all together:- For a in (1, 2), f(a) > f(4 - a)- For a in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a)At a = 2, f(a) = f(4 - a) = 0, so the inequality does not hold.So, the range of a where f(a) > f(4 - a) is (1, 2).Wait, but the options are A: (1, 2), B: (2, 3), C: (1, 3), D: (2, 4). So, according to this, the answer should be A: (1, 2).But wait, in the initial analysis, I thought that in (1, 2), f(a) > f(4 - a), and in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a). So, the solution is a in (1, 2).But wait, let me think again. When a is in (1, 2), 4 - a is in (2, 3). So, f(a) is decreasing from +infty to 0, and f(4 - a) is increasing from |ln(2)| ≈ 0.693 to |ln(1)| = 0. Wait, no, f(4 - a) when a is in (1, 2) is f(4 - a) = ln(3 - a), which is decreasing from ln(2) ≈ 0.693 to ln(1) = 0 as a increases from 1 to 2.So, f(a) is decreasing from +infty to 0, and f(4 - a) is decreasing from 0.693 to 0. So, f(a) starts much larger than f(4 - a) and remains larger throughout the interval (1, 2).Wait, but when a approaches 2 from the left, f(a) approaches 0, and f(4 - a) approaches 0 as well, but f(a) is slightly larger than f(4 - a) near a = 2.So, the inequality f(a) > f(4 - a) holds for all a in (1, 2).But wait, earlier when I thought about a = 2.99, I made a mistake in calculating f(4 - a). So, in reality, for a in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a).So, the solution is a in (1, 2), which is option A.Wait, but the initial problem statement says f(a) > f(4 - a). So, according to my analysis, the answer should be A: (1, 2).But wait, the initial problem statement says f(a) > f(4 - a). So, according to my analysis, the answer should be A: (1, 2).But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:A: (1, 2)B: (2, 3)C: (1, 3)D: (2, 4)So, according to my analysis, the correct answer is A: (1, 2).But wait, in the initial problem, the assistant's answer was B: (2, 3). So, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.Wait, let me go back to the initial analysis.The assistant wrote:\\"Thus, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1, 2) and monotonically increasing on (2, +∞).From the problem, we know thatbegin{cases}  text{a-1>0}   text{4-a-1>0}end{cases}This implies that 1 < a < 3.Now, let's discuss three cases:1. When 1 < a < 2, a - 4 > 2.   If f(a) > f(4-a), then -ln(a-1) > ln(3-a).   By transforming the inequality, we get (a-1)(a-3) > 1.   Solving this inequality gives us a < 2 - √2 or a > 2 + √2.   However, considering 1 < a < 2, there is no solution in this case.2. When a = 2, 4 - a = 2, and f(a) = f(4-a), which does not satisfy the problem's condition.3. When 2 < a < 3, 0 < 4 - a < 2.   If f(a) > f(4-a), then ln(a-1) > -ln(3-a).   By transforming the inequality, we get (a-1)(a-3) < 1.   Solving this inequality gives us 2 - √2 < a < 2 + √2.Therefore, the range of a is (2, 3).Hence, the answer is boxed{text{B}}.\\"Wait, so the assistant concluded that the solution is (2, 3), but according to my analysis, it's (1, 2). So, where is the mistake?Wait, let me look at the assistant's steps.In case 1, when 1 < a < 2, the assistant wrote:\\"If f(a) > f(4-a), then -ln(a-1) > ln(3-a).By transforming the inequality, we get (a-1)(a-3) > 1.\\"Wait, let me check that step.Starting from:-ln(a - 1) > ln(3 - a)Which is equivalent to:ln(1/(a - 1)) > ln(3 - a)Since ln is increasing, this implies:1/(a - 1) > 3 - aWhich is:1 > (3 - a)(a - 1)Expanding:1 > -a² + 4a - 3Which is:0 > -a² + 4a - 4Multiply by -1:0 < a² - 4a + 4Which is:(a - 2)² > 0Which is always true except at a = 2.But the assistant wrote:\\"By transforming the inequality, we get (a-1)(a-3) > 1.\\"Wait, that's incorrect. Because (a - 1)(a - 3) = a² - 4a + 3, which is different from the expression we have.Wait, let me see:From 1 > (3 - a)(a - 1)Which is 1 > -a² + 4a - 3So, 1 > -a² + 4a - 3Bring 1 to the right:0 > -a² + 4a - 4Multiply by -1:0 < a² - 4a + 4Which is (a - 2)² > 0So, the assistant incorrectly transformed the inequality to (a - 1)(a - 3) > 1, which is not correct.So, the assistant made a mistake in the transformation, leading to an incorrect conclusion.Therefore, the correct solution is that for a in (1, 2), f(a) > f(4 - a), and for a in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a). So, the range of a is (1, 2), which is option A.But wait, the assistant's answer was B: (2, 3), which is incorrect.Wait, but in the initial problem, the function is f(x) = |ln(x - 1)|, and f(a) > f(4 - a). So, according to my analysis, the correct answer is A: (1, 2).But the assistant concluded B: (2, 3). So, perhaps the assistant made a mistake in the transformation.Wait, let me think again.When a is in (1, 2), f(a) = -ln(a - 1), and f(4 - a) = ln(3 - a). So, the inequality is:-ln(a - 1) > ln(3 - a)Which is equivalent to:ln(1/(a - 1)) > ln(3 - a)Which implies:1/(a - 1) > 3 - aWhich is:1 > (3 - a)(a - 1)Which is:1 > -a² + 4a - 3Which is:0 > -a² + 4a - 4Which is:a² - 4a + 4 < 0Which is:(a - 2)² < 0Which has no solution.Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.Wait, so according to this, in case 1, when a is in (1, 2), the inequality f(a) > f(4 - a) reduces to (a - 2)² < 0, which has no solution. So, in this case, there is no a in (1, 2) that satisfies the inequality.Wait, but earlier when I tested a = 1.5, f(a) was larger than f(4 - a). So, there must be a mistake in this transformation.Wait, let me go back.Starting from:-ln(a - 1) > ln(3 - a)Which is:ln(1/(a - 1)) > ln(3 - a)Since ln is increasing, this implies:1/(a - 1) > 3 - aBut 1/(a - 1) is positive because a > 1, and 3 - a is positive because a < 3.So, multiplying both sides by (a - 1) (positive), we get:1 > (3 - a)(a - 1)Which is:1 > -a² + 4a - 3Bring 1 to the right:0 > -a² + 4a - 4Multiply by -1 (reversing inequality):0 < a² - 4a + 4Which is:(a - 2)² > 0Which is always true except at a = 2.So, in this case, for a in (1, 2), the inequality holds for all a except a = 2, which is not in this interval.So, the inequality f(a) > f(4 - a) holds for all a in (1, 2).But according to the assistant's analysis, they transformed the inequality to (a - 1)(a - 3) > 1, which is incorrect.So, the correct conclusion is that for a in (1, 2), f(a) > f(4 - a), and for a in (2, 3), f(a) < f(4 - a).Therefore, the range of a is (1, 2), which is option A.But the assistant's answer was B: (2, 3), which is incorrect.So, the correct answer should be A: (1, 2)."},{"question":"The number of subsets of the set {1, 2, 3} is ______.","answer":"First, identify the number of elements in the set ({1, 2, 3}).

The conditions are that (a) and (b) are the roots of the second trinomial, and (c) and (d) are the roots of the first trinomial. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that for a quadratic trinomial (x^2 + px + q), the sum of the roots is (-p) and the product of the roots is (q). This is known as Vieta's formulas. So, maybe I can apply that here.Let me denote the first trinomial as (T_1(x) = x^2 + a x + b) and the second trinomial as (T_2(x) = x^2 + c x + d). According to the problem, (a) and (b) are the roots of (T_2(x)), and (c) and (d) are the roots of (T_1(x)).Applying Vieta's formulas to (T_2(x)), since (a) and (b) are its roots, the sum of the roots (a + b) should be equal to (-c), and the product (a cdot b) should be equal to (d). So, I can write:1. (a + b = -c)2. (a cdot b = d)Similarly, applying Vieta's formulas to (T_1(x)), since (c) and (d) are its roots, the sum (c + d) should be equal to (-a), and the product (c cdot d) should be equal to (b). So, I have:3. (c + d = -a)4. (c cdot d = b)Now, I have four equations:1. (a + b = -c)2. (a b = d)3. (c + d = -a)4. (c d = b)I need to solve these equations to find the values of (a), (b), (c), and (d). Let me see how I can manipulate these equations.From equation 1: (a + b = -c). Let me solve for (c):(c = -(a + b))Similarly, from equation 3: (c + d = -a). Let me substitute (c) from equation 1 into equation 3:(-(a + b) + d = -a)Simplify:(-a - b + d = -a)Add (a) to both sides:(-b + d = 0)So, (d = b)Wait, that's interesting. So, (d = b). Let me note that down.Now, from equation 2: (a b = d). But since (d = b), substitute that in:(a b = b)Hmm, so (a b = b). Let me subtract (b) from both sides:(a b - b = 0)Factor out (b):(b(a - 1) = 0)So, this equation gives us two possibilities:Either (b = 0) or (a - 1 = 0), which means (a = 1).Let me consider both cases separately.**Case 1: (b = 0)**If (b = 0), then from equation 1: (a + 0 = -c) which simplifies to (a = -c). So, (c = -a).From equation 4: (c d = b). Since (b = 0), this becomes (c d = 0). So, either (c = 0) or (d = 0).But from (c = -a), if (c = 0), then (a = 0). Alternatively, if (d = 0), we already have (b = 0), so (d = 0) is already satisfied.Wait, but let me think. If (c = 0), then from equation 3: (c + d = -a), which becomes (0 + d = -a), so (d = -a). But since (d = b = 0), this implies (a = 0).So, if (c = 0), then (a = 0), (b = 0), (d = 0). So, both trinomials become (x^2). Let me check if this satisfies all the conditions.First trinomial: (x^2 + 0x + 0 = x^2). Its roots are both 0. So, (c = 0) and (d = 0), which are indeed the roots of the first trinomial.Second trinomial: (x^2 + 0x + 0 = x^2). Its roots are both 0, which are (a = 0) and (b = 0). So, this works.Alternatively, if (d = 0), since (d = b = 0), we already have that. So, this case gives us the pair of trinomials (x^2) and (x^2).But wait, is this the only possibility when (b = 0)? Let me see.If (b = 0), then (d = b = 0). From equation 4: (c d = b), which becomes (c cdot 0 = 0), which is always true, regardless of (c). So, (c) can be any value, but from equation 1: (a + b = -c), which is (a + 0 = -c), so (c = -a). So, (c) is determined by (a). Then, from equation 3: (c + d = -a), which is (-a + 0 = -a), which is always true.So, in this case, (a) can be any real number, (b = 0), (c = -a), and (d = 0). Therefore, the trinomials are (x^2 + a x) and (x^2 - a x). Let me verify this.First trinomial: (x^2 + a x). Its roots are (0) and (-a). So, (c = -a) and (d = 0), which are the coefficients of the second trinomial. So, the second trinomial is (x^2 + (-a) x + 0 = x^2 - a x). Its roots are (a) and (0), which are (a) and (b = 0). So, this works.So, in this case, we have an infinite number of solutions where the trinomials are (x^2 + a x) and (x^2 - a x) for any real number (a).**Case 2: (a = 1)**Now, let's consider the other possibility where (a = 1). Then, from equation 1: (1 + b = -c), so (c = -(1 + b)).From equation 2: (1 cdot b = d), so (d = b).From equation 4: (c cdot d = b). Substitute (c = -(1 + b)) and (d = b):(-(1 + b) cdot b = b)Simplify:(-b(1 + b) = b)Multiply out:(-b - b^2 = b)Bring all terms to one side:(-b - b^2 - b = 0)Combine like terms:(-2b - b^2 = 0)Factor:(-b(2 + b) = 0)So, either (-b = 0) which implies (b = 0), or (2 + b = 0) which implies (b = -2).But we are in the case where (a = 1), so let's consider both subcases.**Subcase 2.1: (b = 0)**If (b = 0), then from equation 1: (1 + 0 = -c), so (c = -1).From equation 2: (1 cdot 0 = d), so (d = 0).From equation 3: (c + d = -a), which is (-1 + 0 = -1), which is equal to (-a = -1). So, this holds.From equation 4: (c cdot d = b), which is (-1 cdot 0 = 0), which is equal to (b = 0). So, this holds.Therefore, when (a = 1) and (b = 0), we get (c = -1) and (d = 0). So, the trinomials are (x^2 + x) and (x^2 - x). Wait, but this is actually the same as the previous case when (a = 1). So, this is just a specific instance of the general solution in Case 1.**Subcase 2.2: (b = -2)**Now, if (b = -2), let's see what happens.From equation 1: (1 + (-2) = -c), so (-1 = -c), which implies (c = 1).From equation 2: (1 cdot (-2) = d), so (d = -2).From equation 3: (c + d = -a), which is (1 + (-2) = -1), which is equal to (-a = -1). So, this holds.From equation 4: (c cdot d = b), which is (1 cdot (-2) = -2), which is equal to (b = -2). So, this holds.Therefore, when (a = 1) and (b = -2), we get (c = 1) and (d = -2). So, both trinomials are (x^2 + x - 2).Let me check this. The first trinomial is (x^2 + x - 2). Its roots can be found using the quadratic formula:(x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 3}{2}), so the roots are (1) and (-2). So, (c = 1) and (d = -2), which are the coefficients of the second trinomial. The second trinomial is also (x^2 + x - 2), which has the same roots (1) and (-2), which are (a = 1) and (b = -2). So, this works.So, in this case, we have a specific solution where both trinomials are the same: (x^2 + x - 2).Therefore, combining both cases, we have two types of solutions:1. For any real number (a), the pair of trinomials (x^2 + a x) and (x^2 - a x).2. The specific pair where both trinomials are (x^2 + x - 2).I think that's all the possibilities. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.We started with four equations from Vieta's formulas, substituted and solved them, leading to two cases: (b = 0) and (a = 1). In the first case, (b = 0) leads to a general solution with parameter (a). In the second case, (a = 1) leads to either a specific solution or a repetition of the general solution. The only new solution from the second case is when (b = -2), giving the specific trinomial (x^2 + x - 2).I don't think there are any other solutions because we've exhausted both possibilities from the equation (b(a - 1) = 0). So, I believe these are all the pairs that satisfy the given conditions."},{"question":"Let f be a rational function (i.e. the quotient of two real polynomials) and suppose that  f(n)  is an integer for infinitely many integers n. Prove that f is a polynomial.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: Let f be a rational function, which means it's the quotient of two real polynomials. The problem states that if f(n) is an integer for infinitely many integers n, then f must be a polynomial. Hmm, interesting. I need to prove that f is a polynomial under these conditions.Okay, first, let's recall what a rational function is. It's a function of the form f(x) = P(x)/Q(x), where P and Q are polynomials. So, f is a ratio of two polynomials. Now, the problem says that f(n) is an integer for infinitely many integers n. That means when we plug in infinitely many integer values for x, the result is an integer. I need to show that under this condition, f must actually be a polynomial, not just a rational function.So, if f is a polynomial, that means Q(x) must be a constant polynomial, right? Because if Q(x) is not constant, then f(x) would be a proper rational function, not a polynomial. So, the goal is to show that Q(x) is a constant polynomial.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use some properties of polynomials or rational functions. Since f(n) is an integer for infinitely many integers n, perhaps I can use the fact that polynomials with integer outputs at integer inputs have certain properties.Wait, but f is a rational function, not necessarily a polynomial. So, I need to find a way to show that the denominator Q(x) must divide the numerator P(x) for infinitely many x, which would imply that Q(x) is a constant.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if a rational function takes integer values at infinitely many integers, then it must be a polynomial. I think I've heard something like that before, but I need to recall the exact reasoning.Let me try to formalize this. Suppose f(x) = P(x)/Q(x), where P and Q are polynomials with real coefficients. We know that f(n) is an integer for infinitely many integers n. So, for these n, P(n)/Q(n) is an integer. That means Q(n) divides P(n) in the integers, right? Because if you have a fraction that's an integer, the denominator must divide the numerator.So, Q(n) divides P(n) for infinitely many integers n. Now, Q(x) is a polynomial, so it can only have a finite number of roots unless it's the zero polynomial, which it's not because f is a rational function. So, Q(x) has finitely many roots. Therefore, outside of these roots, Q(x) is non-zero.But we have infinitely many integers n where Q(n) divides P(n). So, Q(n) must divide P(n) for infinitely many n. Now, if Q(x) is not a constant polynomial, then it has a degree of at least 1. Let's say deg(Q) = d ≥ 1. Then, as n grows large, Q(n) grows like n^d, and P(n) grows like n^m, where m is the degree of P.If m < d, then P(n)/Q(n) tends to zero as n goes to infinity, but since f(n) is an integer, it would have to be zero for infinitely many n, which would imply that P(x) is the zero polynomial, which contradicts f being a rational function. So, m must be at least d.If m = d, then P(n)/Q(n) tends to the leading coefficient of P divided by the leading coefficient of Q. If this limit is not an integer, then for large n, P(n)/Q(n) would not be an integer, which contradicts the assumption. So, the leading coefficients must be such that their ratio is an integer.But even if the leading coefficients give an integer ratio, the lower degree terms could cause problems. For example, consider P(x) = 2x + 1 and Q(x) = x. Then, P(n)/Q(n) = 2 + 1/n, which is not an integer for any integer n except n = ±1. So, in this case, f(n) is not an integer for infinitely many n.Wait, but in our case, f(n) is an integer for infinitely many n. So, maybe the lower degree terms must also align in such a way that Q(n) divides P(n) for infinitely many n. But how can that happen unless Q(x) divides P(x) as polynomials?Because if Q(x) divides P(x), then P(x) = Q(x) * S(x) for some polynomial S(x), and then f(x) = S(x), which is a polynomial. So, if Q(x) divides P(x), then f is a polynomial.But how do we show that Q(x) must divide P(x)? Well, if Q(n) divides P(n) for infinitely many n, then perhaps we can use the fact that a polynomial that has infinitely many roots must be the zero polynomial.Let me think. Suppose that Q(x) does not divide P(x). Then, P(x) = Q(x) * S(x) + R(x), where R(x) is a polynomial of degree less than deg(Q). If Q(x) does not divide P(x), then R(x) is not the zero polynomial.Now, for each n where Q(n) divides P(n), we have P(n) = Q(n) * k_n for some integer k_n. So, substituting into the equation, we get Q(n) * k_n = Q(n) * S(n) + R(n). Therefore, R(n) = Q(n) * (k_n - S(n)).But R(n) is a polynomial of degree less than deg(Q), and Q(n) is a polynomial of degree d ≥ 1. So, R(n) is being expressed as Q(n) times some integer (k_n - S(n)). But R(n) has degree less than d, while Q(n) has degree d. So, unless R(n) is the zero polynomial, this can't hold for infinitely many n.Because if R(n) is not zero, then for large n, |R(n)| < |Q(n)|, since deg(R) < deg(Q). Therefore, |R(n)| < |Q(n)|, but R(n) = Q(n) * (k_n - S(n)). So, |k_n - S(n)| = |R(n)/Q(n)| < 1. But k_n and S(n) are integers (since f(n) is integer and S(n) is a polynomial with real coefficients? Wait, no, S(n) is a polynomial with real coefficients, so S(n) might not be an integer.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't quite right. Let me think again.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) is integer for infinitely many integers x, then Q(x) must divide P(x) in the polynomial ring. Because if Q(x) doesn't divide P(x), then there are only finitely many x where Q(x) divides P(x), which contradicts the assumption.But how to formalize this? Maybe consider the polynomial R(x) = P(x) - Q(x) * k, where k is an integer. If f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) is integer for infinitely many x, then for each such x, there exists an integer k_x such that P(x) = Q(x) * k_x. So, P(x) - Q(x) * k_x = 0 for infinitely many x.But P(x) - Q(x) * k_x is a polynomial, and if it has infinitely many roots, it must be the zero polynomial. However, k_x depends on x, so this might not directly apply.Wait, but if we fix k, then P(x) - Q(x) * k can have only finitely many roots. So, if we have infinitely many x where P(x)/Q(x) is integer, meaning P(x) = Q(x) * k_x for some integer k_x depending on x, then we can't directly say that P(x) - Q(x) * k is zero for infinitely many x unless k is fixed.Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's consider the difference f(x) - g(x), where g(x) is some polynomial that agrees with f(x) at infinitely many points. Since f(x) is a rational function, if it agrees with a polynomial at infinitely many points, then f(x) must be that polynomial.But how do we know such a polynomial g(x) exists? Well, if f(x) takes integer values at infinitely many integers, then perhaps we can construct a polynomial that interpolates these values.Wait, but interpolation usually requires a finite number of points. However, if we have infinitely many points, maybe we can use the identity theorem for polynomials, which states that two polynomials that agree on infinitely many points must be identical.But f(x) is a rational function, not necessarily a polynomial. So, if we can show that f(x) agrees with some polynomial g(x) on infinitely many points, then f(x) must be equal to g(x), hence a polynomial.But how do we construct such a polynomial g(x)? Maybe by considering the values of f(x) at these infinitely many integers and constructing a polynomial that passes through those points.But constructing such a polynomial might not be straightforward, especially since we don't know the degree of g(x). However, we can use the fact that f(x) is a rational function, so it has a certain structure.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) is integer for infinitely many integers x, then Q(x) must divide P(x) for infinitely many x, which would imply that Q(x) divides P(x) as polynomials, hence f(x) is a polynomial.But I need to make this precise. Let's suppose that Q(x) does not divide P(x). Then, as I mentioned earlier, P(x) = Q(x) * S(x) + R(x), where R(x) is a polynomial of degree less than deg(Q). If Q(x) does not divide P(x), then R(x) is not zero.Now, for each x where Q(x) divides P(x), we have R(x) = 0. But R(x) is a polynomial of degree less than deg(Q). So, R(x) can have at most deg(Q) - 1 roots. Therefore, there can be at most deg(Q) - 1 such x where Q(x) divides P(x). But the problem states that there are infinitely many such x, which contradicts the fact that R(x) can only have finitely many roots.Therefore, our assumption that Q(x) does not divide P(x) must be false. Hence, Q(x) divides P(x), which implies that f(x) = P(x)/Q(x) is a polynomial.Wait, does this make sense? Let me double-check.If Q(x) divides P(x), then P(x) = Q(x) * S(x) for some polynomial S(x), so f(x) = S(x), which is a polynomial. Therefore, f is a polynomial.Yes, that seems to work. So, the key idea is that if Q(x) does not divide P(x), then the remainder R(x) would have to have infinitely many roots, which is impossible unless R(x) is the zero polynomial. Hence, Q(x) must divide P(x), making f a polynomial.I think this is a solid argument. It uses the division algorithm for polynomials and the fact that a non-zero polynomial can only have finitely many roots. Therefore, if we have infinitely many x where Q(x) divides P(x), it must be that Q(x) divides P(x) identically, meaning f is a polynomial.Another way to think about it is using the concept of polynomial identities. If two polynomials agree on infinitely many points, they must be identical. In this case, if f(x) is a rational function that agrees with a polynomial (which is integer-valued at those points) on infinitely many points, then f(x) must be that polynomial.But I think the first approach using the division algorithm is more straightforward and doesn't require assuming the existence of another polynomial. It directly shows that Q(x) must divide P(x) because otherwise, the remainder would have too many roots.So, to summarize:1. Assume f(x) = P(x)/Q(x), where P and Q are polynomials.2. Suppose f(n) is integer for infinitely many integers n.3. If Q(x) does not divide P(x), then P(x) = Q(x) * S(x) + R(x), with R(x) ≠ 0 and deg(R) < deg(Q).4. For each n where Q(n) divides P(n), R(n) = 0.5. But R(x) can have at most deg(Q) - 1 roots, contradicting the infinitely many n.6. Therefore, Q(x) must divide P(x), so f(x) is a polynomial.Yes, that seems correct. I think I've got it."},{"question":"Given that ( A ) and ( B ) are two subsets of the set ({1,2,3, cdots, 100}), satisfying ( |A| = |B| ) and ( A cap B = varnothing ). If ( x in A ) always implies ( 2x + 2 in B ), what is the maximum number of elements in the set ( A cup B )?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum number of elements in the union of two subsets, A and B, of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. The conditions are that the sizes of A and B are equal, they don't overlap (their intersection is empty), and for every element x in A, the element 2x + 2 must be in B. First, I need to understand the constraints. Since A and B are subsets of {1, 2, ..., 100}, and they can't have any elements in common, their union will have at most 100 elements. But because of the specific condition that for every x in A, 2x + 2 is in B, there's a dependency between elements of A and B. Let me think about this dependency. If x is in A, then 2x + 2 must be in B. So, for each x in A, there's a corresponding element in B. Since |A| = |B|, this makes sense because each element in A maps to a unique element in B. But wait, does each x in A map to a unique 2x + 2 in B? Let me check. Suppose x and y are two different elements in A. Then 2x + 2 and 2y + 2 must be different because if 2x + 2 = 2y + 2, then x = y. So yes, each x in A maps to a unique element in B, which means that the mapping is injective. Since |A| = |B|, this mapping is also surjective, meaning every element in B is of the form 2x + 2 for some x in A. So, the key here is that B is entirely determined by A. Therefore, to maximize |A ∪ B|, I need to maximize |A| + |B|, which is 2|A|, since |A| = |B|. So, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible |A| such that all elements of the form 2x + 2 are within {1, 2, ..., 100} and don't overlap with A.Let me figure out the maximum x such that 2x + 2 ≤ 100. Solving for x, we get 2x ≤ 98, so x ≤ 49. Therefore, A can only contain numbers from 1 to 49 because if x were 50 or higher, 2x + 2 would exceed 100, which isn't allowed. So, A must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., 49}. Now, I need to choose A such that none of the elements in B (which are 2x + 2 for x in A) overlap with A. That is, for any x in A, 2x + 2 should not be in A. This sounds like a problem where I need to avoid certain elements in A to prevent overlaps. Maybe I can model this as a graph where each number from 1 to 49 is a node, and there's an edge from x to 2x + 2. Then, A should be an independent set in this graph, meaning no two nodes in A are connected by an edge. Alternatively, perhaps I can partition the set {1, 2, ..., 49} into chains where each chain is of the form x, 2x + 2, 2(2x + 2) + 2, etc., until we exceed 49. Then, in each chain, I can select every other element to include in A, ensuring that no two selected elements are connected by an edge. Let me try to construct such chains. Starting with x = 1: 1, 2*1 + 2 = 4, 2*4 + 2 = 10, 2*10 + 2 = 22, 2*22 + 2 = 46, 2*46 + 2 = 94. But 94 is beyond 49, so the chain is 1, 4, 10, 22, 46. Similarly, starting with x = 2: 2, 2*2 + 2 = 6, 2*6 + 2 = 14, 2*14 + 2 = 30, 2*30 + 2 = 62, which is beyond 49. So the chain is 2, 6, 14, 30. Continuing this way, let's list out all possible chains:1. 1, 4, 10, 22, 462. 2, 6, 14, 303. 3, 8, 18, 384. 5, 12, 26, 54 (but 54 > 49, so chain is 5, 12, 26)5. 7, 16, 346. 9, 20, 427. 11, 24, 50 (50 > 49, so chain is 11, 24)8. 13, 28, 58 (58 > 49, so chain is 13, 28)9. 15, 32, 66 (66 > 49, so chain is 15, 32)10. 17, 36, 74 (74 > 49, so chain is 17, 36)11. 19, 40, 82 (82 > 49, so chain is 19, 40)12. 21, 44, 90 (90 > 49, so chain is 21, 44)13. 23, 48, 98 (98 > 49, so chain is 23, 48)14. 25, 52 (52 > 49, so chain is 25)15. 27, 56 (56 > 49, so chain is 27)16. 29, 60 (60 > 49, so chain is 29)17. 31, 64 (64 > 49, so chain is 31)18. 33, 68 (68 > 49, so chain is 33)19. 35, 72 (72 > 49, so chain is 35)20. 37, 76 (76 > 49, so chain is 37)21. 39, 80 (80 > 49, so chain is 39)22. 41, 84 (84 > 49, so chain is 41)23. 43, 88 (88 > 49, so chain is 43)24. 45, 92 (92 > 49, so chain is 45)25. 47, 96 (96 > 49, so chain is 47)26. 49, 100 (100 is allowed, so chain is 49, 100)Wait, but 100 is in the original set, so 49 maps to 100, which is fine. Now, looking at these chains, each chain is a sequence where each element is mapped to the next by x → 2x + 2. To form A, I need to select elements such that no two elements are in the same chain, and importantly, if I select an element x from a chain, I cannot select 2x + 2 from the same chain. This is similar to selecting an independent set in each chain. For each chain, the maximum independent set is the number of elements you can choose without selecting two consecutive elements in the chain. For example, in the first chain: 1, 4, 10, 22, 46. The maximum independent set here would be selecting every other element. Let's see: if I pick 1, I can't pick 4, but I can pick 10, then skip 22, pick 46. So that's 3 elements. Alternatively, if I skip 1, pick 4, skip 10, pick 22, skip 46. That's also 3 elements. So the maximum independent set for this chain is 3.Similarly, for the second chain: 2, 6, 14, 30. The maximum independent set would be 2 elements. For example, pick 2 and 14, or 6 and 30.Wait, actually, for a chain of length n, the maximum independent set is the floor((n + 1)/2). So for a chain of length 5, it's 3; for a chain of length 4, it's 2; for a chain of length 3, it's 2; for a chain of length 2, it's 1; and for a chain of length 1, it's 1.So, let's go through each chain and calculate the maximum independent set size:1. Chain 1: 1, 4, 10, 22, 46 → length 5 → 32. Chain 2: 2, 6, 14, 30 → length 4 → 23. Chain 3: 3, 8, 18, 38 → length 4 → 24. Chain 4: 5, 12, 26 → length 3 → 25. Chain 5: 7, 16, 34 → length 3 → 26. Chain 6: 9, 20, 42 → length 3 → 27. Chain 7: 11, 24 → length 2 → 18. Chain 8: 13, 28 → length 2 → 19. Chain 9: 15, 32 → length 2 → 110. Chain 10: 17, 36 → length 2 → 111. Chain 11: 19, 40 → length 2 → 112. Chain 12: 21, 44 → length 2 → 113. Chain 13: 23, 48 → length 2 → 114. Chain 14: 25 → length 1 → 115. Chain 15: 27 → length 1 → 116. Chain 16: 29 → length 1 → 117. Chain 17: 31 → length 1 → 118. Chain 18: 33 → length 1 → 119. Chain 19: 35 → length 1 → 120. Chain 20: 37 → length 1 → 121. Chain 21: 39 → length 1 → 122. Chain 22: 41 → length 1 → 123. Chain 23: 43 → length 1 → 124. Chain 24: 45 → length 1 → 125. Chain 25: 47 → length 1 → 126. Chain 26: 49, 100 → length 2 → 1Now, let's sum up the maximum independent set sizes for each chain:- Chains 1-3: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7- Chains 4-6: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6- Chains 7-13: 1 each, 7 chains → 7- Chains 14-25: 1 each, 12 chains → 12- Chain 26: 1Wait, let me recount:Chains 1: 3Chains 2-3: 2 each → 2 + 2 = 4Chains 4-6: 2 each → 2 + 2 + 2 = 6Chains 7-13: 1 each, that's 7 chains → 7Chains 14-25: 1 each, that's 12 chains → 12Chain 26: 1Total: 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 12 + 1 = 33So, the total maximum independent set size is 33. This means that the maximum size of A is 33, which implies that |B| is also 33, so |A ∪ B| = 33 + 33 = 66.But wait, let me verify this. If A has 33 elements, and each element in A maps to a unique element in B, and since A and B are disjoint, their union should indeed be 66 elements. Is there a way to get a larger A? Let me think. If I try to include more elements in A, say 34, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the chains would have two elements from A, which would mean that for some x in A, 2x + 2 is also in A, which contradicts the condition that 2x + 2 must be in B, not in A. Therefore, 33 is indeed the maximum size for A.So, the maximum number of elements in A ∪ B is 66."},{"question":"Given positive numbers a, b, c satisfy ab + a + b = bc + b + c = ac + a + c = 3, then (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)= ?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given three positive numbers a, b, and c. They satisfy these three equations: ab + a + b = 3, bc + b + c = 3, and ac + a + c = 3. I need to find the value of (a+1)(b+1)(c+1). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, looking at the equations, each of them is of the form xy + x + y = 3, where x and y are two of the variables a, b, c. I remember that expressions like xy + x + y can sometimes be factored or rewritten in a more manageable form. Let me try that.If I take the first equation, ab + a + b = 3. I can factor this by adding 1 to both sides. So, ab + a + b + 1 = 4. Now, the left side can be factored as (a + 1)(b + 1). So, (a + 1)(b + 1) = 4. That's interesting. Let me write that down:1. (a + 1)(b + 1) = 4Similarly, let's apply the same logic to the second equation: bc + b + c = 3. Adding 1 to both sides gives bc + b + c + 1 = 4, which factors to (b + 1)(c + 1) = 4.2. (b + 1)(c + 1) = 4And the third equation: ac + a + c = 3. Adding 1 to both sides, we get ac + a + c + 1 = 4, which factors to (a + 1)(c + 1) = 4.3. (a + 1)(c + 1) = 4So now I have three equations:1. (a + 1)(b + 1) = 42. (b + 1)(c + 1) = 43. (a + 1)(c + 1) = 4I need to find (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1). Let's denote this product as P. So, P = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1). If I can find P, that would solve the problem.Looking at the three equations, each pair of terms in P is equal to 4. So, if I multiply all three equations together, I get:[(a + 1)(b + 1)] * [(b + 1)(c + 1)] * [(a + 1)(c + 1)] = 4 * 4 * 4Simplifying the left side, we have (a + 1)^2 * (b + 1)^2 * (c + 1)^2, which is equal to [ (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) ]^2. So,[ (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) ]^2 = 4^3 = 64Taking the square root of both sides, we get:(a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) = sqrt(64) = 8But wait, since a, b, c are positive numbers, each of (a + 1), (b + 1), (c + 1) is greater than 1, so their product must be positive. Therefore, we don't need to consider the negative square root.So, (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) = 8.Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by factoring each equation, which gave me three products equal to 4. Then, I multiplied them together, which gave me the square of the desired product. Taking the square root gave me 8, which makes sense because all terms are positive. Yeah, that seems right.I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by solving for each variable individually. Let me try that quickly.From the first equation, (a + 1)(b + 1) = 4. Let's solve for one variable in terms of another. Let's say, solve for b in terms of a.From (a + 1)(b + 1) = 4, we can write b + 1 = 4 / (a + 1), so b = (4 / (a + 1)) - 1 = (4 - (a + 1)) / (a + 1) = (3 - a) / (a + 1).Similarly, from the second equation, (b + 1)(c + 1) = 4. Substitute b from above:[(3 - a)/(a + 1) + 1] * (c + 1) = 4Simplify the first term:[(3 - a + a + 1)/(a + 1)] = (4)/(a + 1)So, (4)/(a + 1) * (c + 1) = 4Multiply both sides by (a + 1)/4:(c + 1) = (a + 1)So, c + 1 = a + 1, which implies c = a.Interesting, so c equals a. Let me note that: c = a.Now, let's use the third equation: (a + 1)(c + 1) = 4. Since c = a, this becomes (a + 1)^2 = 4. Taking square roots, a + 1 = 2, so a = 1.Therefore, a = 1, c = 1.Now, let's find b. From earlier, b = (3 - a)/(a + 1). Substituting a = 1:b = (3 - 1)/(1 + 1) = 2/2 = 1.So, a = b = c = 1.Therefore, (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) = (1 + 1)^3 = 2^3 = 8.Okay, that confirms the earlier result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.I think I've got it. The value of (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) is 8.**Final Answer**The value of (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Let a < b < c be the solutions of the equation 2016 x^{3} - 4 x + frac{3}{sqrt{2016}} = 0. Determine the value of -1 / (a b^{2} c).","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: 2016x³ - 4x + 3/√2016 = 0. I need to find the value of -1/(ab²c), where a < b < c are the solutions of the equation. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.First, I notice that the equation has a term with √2016 in the denominator. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let me try substituting y = √2016 * x. That way, x = y / √2016. Let's substitute that into the equation.So, replacing x with y / √2016, the equation becomes:2016*(y / √2016)³ - 4*(y / √2016) + 3/√2016 = 0.Let me compute each term step by step.First term: 2016*(y³ / (√2016)³) = 2016*y³ / (2016√2016) = y³ / √2016.Second term: -4*(y / √2016) = -4y / √2016.Third term: 3/√2016.So putting it all together, the equation becomes:(y³ / √2016) - (4y / √2016) + (3 / √2016) = 0.I can factor out 1/√2016:(1/√2016)(y³ - 4y + 3) = 0.Since 1/√2016 is not zero, the equation simplifies to:y³ - 4y + 3 = 0.Okay, that's a simpler cubic equation. Now, I need to solve y³ - 4y + 3 = 0.Let me try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±3.Let me test y = 1:1³ - 4*1 + 3 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0. Oh, y = 1 is a root.So, I can factor out (y - 1) from the cubic equation.Using polynomial division or synthetic division, let's divide y³ - 4y + 3 by (y - 1).Using synthetic division:1 | 1  0  -4  3          1   1  -3      1  1  -3  0So, the cubic factors as (y - 1)(y² + y - 3) = 0.Now, set each factor equal to zero:1. y - 1 = 0 ⇒ y = 1.2. y² + y - 3 = 0.Let's solve the quadratic equation y² + y - 3 = 0 using the quadratic formula:y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a) = [-1 ± √(1 + 12)] / 2 = [-1 ± √13] / 2.So, the solutions are y = 1, y = (-1 + √13)/2, and y = (-1 - √13)/2.Now, since we substituted y = √2016 * x, we can find the corresponding x values.So, x = y / √2016.Therefore, the solutions for x are:x₁ = 1 / √2016,x₂ = [(-1 + √13)/2] / √2016,x₃ = [(-1 - √13)/2] / √2016.Let me write them more clearly:a = [(-1 - √13)/2] / √2016,b = 1 / √2016,c = [(-1 + √13)/2] / √2016.Wait, the problem says a < b < c. Let me check the numerical values to confirm the order.Compute approximate values:√13 ≈ 3.6055,So,a ≈ [(-1 - 3.6055)/2] / √2016 ≈ (-4.6055/2) / 44.911 ≈ (-2.30275) / 44.911 ≈ -0.0513.b ≈ 1 / 44.911 ≈ 0.02226.c ≈ [(-1 + 3.6055)/2] / 44.911 ≈ (2.6055/2) / 44.911 ≈ 1.30275 / 44.911 ≈ 0.029.Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.029 is less than 0.02226? Wait, no, 0.029 is greater than 0.02226. So, a ≈ -0.0513, b ≈ 0.02226, c ≈ 0.029.Wait, so a is negative, and b and c are positive. So, a < b < c is correct because -0.0513 < 0.02226 < 0.029.Wait, but 0.02226 is less than 0.029, so b < c. So, order is a < b < c.Okay, so now I have a, b, c.Now, I need to compute -1/(a b² c).Let me write a, b, c in terms of y:a = [(-1 - √13)/2] / √2016,b = 1 / √2016,c = [(-1 + √13)/2] / √2016.So, let's compute a * b² * c.First, compute a * c:a * c = [(-1 - √13)/2] / √2016 * [(-1 + √13)/2] / √2016.Multiply the numerators:[(-1 - √13)(-1 + √13)] / (2 * 2) = [(-1)^2 - (√13)^2] / 4 = (1 - 13) / 4 = (-12)/4 = -3.Denominator: (√2016)^2 = 2016.So, a * c = (-3)/2016.Now, b² is (1 / √2016)^2 = 1 / 2016.So, a * b² * c = (a * c) * b² = (-3 / 2016) * (1 / 2016) = (-3) / (2016^2).Therefore, -1 / (a b² c) = -1 / [(-3)/(2016^2)] = -1 * [2016^2 / (-3)] = (2016^2)/3.Compute 2016^2:2016 * 2016. Let me compute that.2016 * 2000 = 4,032,000,2016 * 16 = 32,256,So, 4,032,000 + 32,256 = 4,064,256.Wait, but 2016^2 is actually 2016*2016. Let me compute it properly.2016 * 2016:Break it down:2000 * 2000 = 4,000,000,2000 * 16 = 32,000,16 * 2000 = 32,000,16 * 16 = 256.So, (2000 + 16)^2 = 2000² + 2*2000*16 + 16² = 4,000,000 + 64,000 + 256 = 4,064,256.So, 2016² = 4,064,256.Therefore, (2016²)/3 = 4,064,256 / 3.Compute 4,064,256 ÷ 3:3 into 4 is 1, remainder 1.3 into 10 is 3, remainder 1.3 into 16 is 5, remainder 1.3 into 14 is 4, remainder 2.3 into 22 is 7, remainder 1.3 into 15 is 5, remainder 0.3 into 6 is 2.So, 4,064,256 ÷ 3 = 1,354,752.So, -1/(a b² c) = 1,354,752.Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, substitution y = √2016 x, leading to y³ - 4y + 3 = 0. Factored as (y - 1)(y² + y - 3) = 0, giving roots y = 1 and y = [-1 ± √13]/2. Then converted back to x, giving a, b, c.Computed a * c as [(-1 - √13)/2 * (-1 + √13)/2] = (-12)/4 = -3, divided by (√2016)^2 = 2016, so a * c = -3/2016.Then, b² = 1/2016, so a * b² * c = (-3/2016)*(1/2016) = -3/(2016²).Thus, -1/(a b² c) = -1/(-3/(2016²)) = 2016² / 3 = 4,064,256 / 3 = 1,354,752.Yes, that seems correct."},{"question":"The base of the pyramid S A B C D is an arbitrary quadrilateral A B C D. Construct the line of intersection of the planes A B S and C D S.","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about a pyramid with a quadrilateral base. The pyramid is labeled SABCD, and the base is ABCD, which is an arbitrary quadrilateral. The question is asking me to construct the line of intersection of the planes ABS and CDS. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, I need to recall what a pyramid with a quadrilateral base looks like. It has a base that's a four-sided figure, and then four triangular faces that meet at the apex S. So, the base is ABCD, and the apex is S. The planes in question are ABS and CDS. Plane ABS is the triangular face formed by points A, B, and S, and plane CDS is the triangular face formed by points C, D, and S.Now, the line of intersection of two planes is a line that lies on both planes. So, I need to find a line that is common to both plane ABS and plane CDS. Since both planes share the apex S, I know that point S is definitely on both planes. So, the line of intersection must pass through S.But where else does this line pass through? Well, in plane ABS, besides S, we have points A and B. In plane CDS, besides S, we have points C and D. So, the line of intersection can't be just any line through S; it has to lie on both planes. That means it must pass through another point that is common to both planes.Wait, but the planes ABS and CDS don't necessarily share any other points besides S unless lines AB and CD intersect. Hmm, so maybe I need to consider whether lines AB and CD intersect or not.If lines AB and CD intersect, then their point of intersection would be a common point to both planes ABS and CDS. Let's call that intersection point M. So, if AB and CD intersect at M, then point M is on both planes ABS and CDS. Therefore, the line of intersection would be the line passing through points S and M.But what if lines AB and CD don't intersect? That would mean they are skew lines or parallel lines. Since we're dealing with a quadrilateral base, which is a planar figure, lines AB and CD can't be skew because they lie on the same plane. So, if they don't intersect, they must be parallel.If AB and CD are parallel, then planes ABS and CDS are both planes that contain the apex S and are each defined by a pair of parallel lines (AB and CD). In this case, the line of intersection would still pass through S, but it would also be parallel to both AB and CD because the planes are kind of \\"sliding\\" along these parallel lines.So, to summarize, there are two cases:1. If lines AB and CD intersect at a point M, then the line of intersection of planes ABS and CDS is the line SM.2. If lines AB and CD are parallel, then the line of intersection is a line through S that is parallel to both AB and CD.But wait, in the case where AB and CD are parallel, how exactly do we construct that line? Since both planes ABS and CDS contain S and are parallel to AB and CD, respectively, their intersection should be a line that maintains that parallelism. So, if I were to draw a line through S that's parallel to AB (or CD), that should be the line of intersection.Let me try to confirm this with some geometric reasoning. In plane ABS, any line through S will lie on that plane. Similarly, in plane CDS, any line through S will lie on that plane. But the line of intersection must lie on both planes, so it has to satisfy both conditions. If AB and CD are parallel, then the direction of the line of intersection must align with that parallelism to ensure it's common to both planes.Alternatively, if AB and CD intersect, then their intersection point M gives us another point on both planes, so the line SM is the natural intersection line.I think that makes sense. So, depending on whether AB and CD intersect or are parallel, the line of intersection of the two planes will either pass through their intersection point M and S or will be parallel to both AB and CD and pass through S.To construct this line, I would first check if AB and CD intersect. If they do, I would draw the line connecting S and M. If they don't intersect, meaning they're parallel, I would draw a line through S that's parallel to AB (or CD).I wonder if there's a way to generalize this without having to check for intersection each time. Maybe by considering the properties of the pyramid and the quadrilateral base. Since the base is arbitrary, it could be convex, concave, or even self-intersecting, but in standard cases, it's usually convex.In a convex quadrilateral, lines AB and CD might intersect outside the base or not at all if they're parallel. So, in a typical convex quadrilateral, if AB and CD are not parallel, they will intersect at some point M, which might be inside or outside the base. Then, connecting S to M gives the intersection line.If the quadrilateral is such that AB and CD are parallel, like in a trapezoid, then the intersection line would be parallel to these sides and pass through S.I think I've got a good grasp on this now. The key is to determine whether AB and CD intersect and then construct the line accordingly. If they intersect, connect S to that intersection point. If they don't, draw a parallel line through S.Just to make sure, let me think about a specific example. Suppose ABCD is a square, so AB and CD are parallel. Then, the line of intersection would be a line through S parallel to AB and CD. If ABCD is a kite where AB and CD intersect at some point inside the kite, then the line of intersection would be SM, where M is that intersection point.Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the construction depends on the relative positions of AB and CD in the base quadrilateral.Another thought: in 3D space, two planes intersect along a line. Since both planes ABS and CDS contain point S, their intersection must be a line passing through S. The direction of this line is determined by the orientation of the planes, which in turn depends on the positions of AB and CD.So, if AB and CD are skew, but wait, in a pyramid, AB and CD are both on the base, which is a plane, so they can't be skew. They can only be intersecting or parallel. That simplifies things because we don't have to consider skew lines.Therefore, the line of intersection is either SM (if AB and CD intersect at M) or a line through S parallel to AB (if AB and CD are parallel).I think I've covered all the cases. So, the construction is straightforward once we determine the relationship between AB and CD.**Final Answer**The line of intersection is boxed{SM} if lines (AB) and (CD) intersect at point (M). If (AB) and (CD) are parallel, the line of intersection is a line through (S) parallel to (AB)."},{"question":"If the coordinates of point P(x,y) satisfy x+y=xy, then point P is called a \\"beautiful point\\". If the distance from a certain \\"beautiful point\\" M to the y-axis is 2, then the coordinates of point M are ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a \\"beautiful point\\" M. The definition says that a point P(x, y) is beautiful if it satisfies the equation x + y = xy. Interesting. And the problem tells me that the distance from this beautiful point M to the y-axis is 2. I need to find the coordinates of point M.First, let me recall what it means for a point to be a certain distance from the y-axis. The distance from a point to the y-axis is just the absolute value of its x-coordinate. So, if the distance is 2, that means |x| = 2. Therefore, x can be either 2 or -2. So, the x-coordinate of point M is either 2 or -2.Now, since M is a beautiful point, it must satisfy the equation x + y = xy. So, I can plug in x = 2 and x = -2 into this equation to find the corresponding y-values.Let me start with x = 2. Plugging into the equation:2 + y = 2yHmm, let's solve for y. Subtract y from both sides:2 = ySo, when x = 2, y = 2. That gives me the point (2, 2).Now, let's try x = -2. Plugging into the equation:-2 + y = (-2)yLet me solve this step by step. First, I can write it as:-2 + y = -2yNow, I want to get all the y terms on one side. Let me add 2y to both sides:-2 + y + 2y = 0Simplify:-2 + 3y = 0Now, add 2 to both sides:3y = 2Divide both sides by 3:y = 2/3So, when x = -2, y = 2/3. That gives me the point (-2, 2/3).Therefore, the coordinates of point M can be either (2, 2) or (-2, 2/3).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.For x = 2:2 + y = 2ySubtract y from both sides:2 = yThat seems correct.For x = -2:-2 + y = -2yAdding 2y to both sides:-2 + 3y = 0Adding 2:3y = 2Dividing by 3:y = 2/3Yes, that also looks correct.So, both points (2, 2) and (-2, 2/3) satisfy the condition x + y = xy and are at a distance of 2 from the y-axis.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The coordinates of point ( M ) are boxed{(2, 2)} and boxed{(-2, frac{2}{3})}."},{"question":"When a number is divided by 5, the result is 40 more than if the number had been divided by 6. What is the number?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"When a number is divided by 5, the result is 40 more than if the number had been divided by 6. What is the number?\\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's saying that if I take some number, divide it by 5, and then compare that result to when I divide the same number by 6, the first result is 40 more than the second one. So, I need to find what that number is.Let me denote the unknown number as ( x ). So, when ( x ) is divided by 5, it's ( frac{x}{5} ). And when ( x ) is divided by 6, it's ( frac{x}{6} ). According to the problem, ( frac{x}{5} ) is 40 more than ( frac{x}{6} ). So, I can write this as an equation:[frac{x}{5} = frac{x}{6} + 40]Okay, now I have an equation to solve for ( x ). Let me see how to do that. I think I need to get rid of the fractions to make it easier to solve. To eliminate the denominators, I can find a common multiple of 5 and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6 is 30. So, if I multiply both sides of the equation by 30, that should help.Multiplying both sides by 30:[30 times frac{x}{5} = 30 times left( frac{x}{6} + 40 right)]Let me compute each term separately. On the left side:[30 times frac{x}{5} = 6x]Because 30 divided by 5 is 6. On the right side, I need to distribute the 30:[30 times frac{x}{6} + 30 times 40]Calculating each part:[30 times frac{x}{6} = 5x][30 times 40 = 1200]So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:[6x = 5x + 1200]Now, I need to solve for ( x ). I can subtract ( 5x ) from both sides to get:[6x - 5x = 1200][x = 1200]Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting again, the original equation:[frac{x}{5} = frac{x}{6} + 40]Multiplying both sides by 30:[6x = 5x + 1200]Subtracting ( 5x ):[x = 1200]Okay, that seems consistent. Let me verify by plugging ( x = 1200 ) back into the original problem.Dividing 1200 by 5:[frac{1200}{5} = 240]Dividing 1200 by 6:[frac{1200}{6} = 200]Now, checking if 240 is 40 more than 200:[200 + 40 = 240]Yes, that works out. So, the number is indeed 1200.I think I got it right. But just to be thorough, let me try another approach to confirm.Alternative method: Instead of eliminating fractions immediately, I can subtract ( frac{x}{6} ) from both sides to get:[frac{x}{5} - frac{x}{6} = 40]To combine the fractions, I need a common denominator, which is 30. So:[frac{6x - 5x}{30} = 40][frac{x}{30} = 40]Multiplying both sides by 30:[x = 1200]Same result. Okay, that's reassuring. Both methods lead me to ( x = 1200 ).Just to make sure, let me think about whether there's another way to interpret the problem. The problem says, \\"the result is 40 more than if the number had been divided by 6.\\" So, it's comparing the two division results directly, not involving any other operations. So, my initial equation seems appropriate.Another point to consider: Could there be a different number that satisfies this condition? Let's suppose ( x ) is not 1200. For example, if ( x = 600 ), then:[frac{600}{5} = 120][frac{600}{6} = 100][120 - 100 = 20]Which is not 40. So, 600 doesn't work. If ( x = 1800 ):[frac{1800}{5} = 360][frac{1800}{6} = 300][360 - 300 = 60]Still not 40. So, 1200 seems to be the only number that fits.I think I've covered all bases here. I set up the equation correctly, solved it using two different methods, and verified the solution by plugging it back into the original problem. Both methods gave the same result, and the verification confirms that it's correct. So, I'm confident that the number is 1200."},{"question":"Compute cos 180^circ.","answer":"I need to find the value of (cos 180^circ).First, I recall that the unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of the coordinate system. Angles in the unit circle are measured from the positive x-axis.When the angle is (180^circ), it points directly to the left on the unit circle. This corresponds to the point ((-1, 0)).In the unit circle, the cosine of an angle is the x-coordinate of the corresponding point. Therefore, (cos 180^circ) is the x-coordinate of the point at (180^circ), which is (-1).So, (cos 180^circ = -1)."},{"question":"Given a convex quadrilateral ( A B C D ) with pairwise non-parallel sides, a point ( P ) is chosen on side ( A D ), different from ( A ) and ( D ). The circumcircles of triangles ( A B P ) and ( C D P ) intersect again at point ( Q ). Prove that the line ( P Q ) passes through a fixed point independent of the choice of point ( P ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex quadrilateral ABCD with non-parallel sides. A point P is chosen on side AD, not at A or D. Then, the circumcircles of triangles ABP and CDP intersect again at point Q. I need to prove that the line PQ passes through a fixed point, no matter where P is on AD. Hmm, interesting.First, let me try to visualize the problem. I have quadrilateral ABCD, which is convex, so all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and none of its sides are parallel. That means the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA all intersect each other at some points outside the quadrilateral. Point P is somewhere on AD, not at the endpoints. Then, I'm looking at the circumcircles of triangles ABP and CDP. These two circles intersect again at Q, meaning Q is another intersection point besides P, I assume. So, PQ is the line connecting P and Q, and I need to show that this line always goes through a specific fixed point, regardless of where P is on AD.I think I should start by drawing a diagram. Let me sketch quadrilateral ABCD, mark point P on AD, draw the circumcircles of ABP and CDP, and see where they intersect again at Q. Then, connect P and Q and see if I can find a fixed point that this line always passes through.Since ABCD is convex, the circumcircles of ABP and CDP should intersect at two points: P and Q. So, Q is determined by the intersection of these two circles. Maybe I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.Let me recall that if two circles intersect at two points, then the line connecting those two points is the radical axis of the two circles. So, PQ is the radical axis of the circumcircles of ABP and CDP. The radical axis is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the two circles. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.Alternatively, maybe I can use power of a point. The power of point Q with respect to both circles should be equal. So, for point Q, the power with respect to the circumcircle of ABP is QA * QB = QP * QA (Wait, no, that's not quite right. The power of Q with respect to the circumcircle of ABP is QA * QB = QP * Q something? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, actually, since Q lies on both circumcircles, it must satisfy the cyclic quadrilateral properties for both ABP and CDP. So, angles at Q should relate to the angles in those triangles.Let me think about the angles. In cyclic quadrilateral ABPQ, the angles at Q should satisfy ∠AQB = ∠APB because they subtend the same arc AB. Similarly, in cyclic quadrilateral CDPQ, the angles at Q should satisfy ∠CQD = ∠CPD because they subtend the same arc CD.Maybe I can relate these angles to find some relationship between points A, B, C, D, and Q. Hmm, perhaps if I can find that Q lies on some fixed line or circle, then PQ would pass through a fixed point.Alternatively, maybe there's a fixed point that PQ always passes through, regardless of P. Let me think about what that fixed point could be. It might be the intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral, but since ABCD is convex, the diagonals intersect at a point inside the quadrilateral. But I'm not sure if PQ passes through that point.Wait, another thought: maybe the fixed point is the intersection of AB and CD. Let me denote that intersection as E. So, if I extend AB and CD, they meet at E. Maybe PQ passes through E? Let me check.If E is the intersection of AB and CD, then perhaps there's some projective geometry or harmonic division properties here. Alternatively, maybe using Ceva's theorem or Menelaus' theorem.Alternatively, perhaps using inversion. If I invert the figure with respect to some circle, maybe the problem becomes simpler. But inversion can be tricky.Wait, let's go back to the angles. Since Q is on both circumcircles, we have that ∠AQB = ∠APB and ∠CQD = ∠CPD. Maybe I can relate these angles to find that Q lies on some fixed circle or line.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of spiral similarity. If I can show that triangles QAB and QCD are similar in some way, then maybe the spiral similarity center is fixed.Wait, another approach: Let's consider the radical axis of the two circumcircles. Since PQ is the radical axis, it is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the two circles. But the centers of the circumcircles of ABP and CDP depend on P, so that might not help directly.Wait, but maybe the radical axis passes through a fixed point. If I can show that for all positions of P, the radical axis PQ passes through a fixed point, then that would solve the problem.Alternatively, maybe the fixed point is the intersection of the diagonals AC and BD. Let me denote that as O. Maybe PQ passes through O. Let me see.If I can show that O lies on PQ for all P, then that would mean PQ passes through O, which is fixed. So, how can I show that O lies on PQ?Let me consider the power of O with respect to both circumcircles. If O lies on PQ, then the power of O with respect to both circles should be equal, which would imply that O lies on the radical axis PQ.So, let's compute the power of O with respect to the circumcircle of ABP. The power is OA * OB = OP * OQ (Wait, no, power is OA * OB = OP * OQ? Wait, no, the power of O with respect to the circumcircle of ABP is OA * OB = OP * OQ? Hmm, not exactly.Wait, the power of a point O with respect to a circle is equal to the product of the distances from O to the points where a line through O intersects the circle. So, for the circumcircle of ABP, if I draw line OA, it intersects the circle at A and some other point. Similarly, line OB intersects the circle at B and some other point. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that O is the intersection of AC and BD. So, if I can relate the angles at O with the angles at Q, maybe I can find that O lies on PQ.Alternatively, maybe using Ceva's theorem. If I can show that the cevians from A, B, C, D meet at a common point, which is O, then maybe PQ passes through O.Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to look for similar triangles or use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.Wait, another idea: Since Q is on both circumcircles, maybe we can use the Miquel point theorem. The Miquel point of a quadrilateral is the common point of the circumcircles of its four triangles, but in this case, we only have two circumcircles. Hmm, not sure.Wait, let me think about the problem again. We have quadrilateral ABCD, point P on AD, and Q is the second intersection of the circumcircles of ABP and CDP. We need to show that PQ passes through a fixed point.Maybe I can fix some points and see what happens. Let me choose specific positions for P and see where Q is, then see if PQ passes through a common point.Suppose P is very close to A. Then, the circumcircle of ABP would be almost the same as the circumcircle of AB, which is just the line AB. Similarly, the circumcircle of CDP would be the circumcircle of CDA, since P is near A. So, Q would be near the intersection of AB and CD, which is point E. So, PQ would be a line from near A to near E, passing through E.Similarly, if P is very close to D, then the circumcircle of ABP would be the circumcircle of ABD, and the circumcircle of CDP would be almost the line CD. So, Q would be near the intersection of AB and CD, which is E again. So, PQ would be a line from near D to near E, passing through E.Wait, so in both cases, when P is near A or near D, PQ passes through E. Maybe E is the fixed point? But E is the intersection of AB and CD, which is fixed.Wait, but when P is somewhere in the middle of AD, does PQ still pass through E? Let me check.If P is somewhere in the middle, then the circumcircles of ABP and CDP would intersect at Q, and PQ would be the radical axis. If E is on PQ, then the power of E with respect to both circles should be equal.Let me compute the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of ABP. The power is EA * EB. Similarly, the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of CDP is EC * ED. If EA * EB = EC * ED, then E lies on the radical axis PQ.But is EA * EB equal to EC * ED? Hmm, in general, for a convex quadrilateral, this might not hold. Wait, but in our case, E is the intersection of AB and CD, so by the power of a point, EA * EB = EC * ED. Wait, is that true?Wait, no, the power of point E with respect to the circumcircle of ABCD would be EA * EB = EC * ED if ABCD is cyclic, but ABCD is just convex, not necessarily cyclic. So, that might not hold.Wait, but in our case, E is the intersection of AB and CD, so by the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of ABP, it's EA * EB = EP * EQ. Similarly, with respect to the circumcircle of CDP, it's EC * ED = EP * EQ. So, both equal to EP * EQ, meaning EA * EB = EC * ED. So, if EA * EB = EC * ED, then E lies on the radical axis PQ.But is EA * EB equal to EC * ED? Hmm, in general, no, unless ABCD is harmonic or something. Wait, but in our case, since E is the intersection of AB and CD, and ABCD is convex, maybe EA * EB = EC * ED?Wait, let me think. If E is the intersection of AB and CD, then by the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of ABCD, if ABCD is cyclic, then EA * EB = EC * ED. But ABCD is not necessarily cyclic. So, maybe EA * EB ≠ EC * ED.Wait, but in our case, E is the intersection of AB and CD, so the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of ABP is EA * EB = EP * EQ, and with respect to the circumcircle of CDP is EC * ED = EP * EQ. Therefore, EA * EB = EC * ED. So, E must lie on the radical axis PQ.Wait, but does EA * EB equal EC * ED? Because if E is the intersection of AB and CD, then by the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of ABCD, if ABCD is cyclic, then yes, but ABCD is not necessarily cyclic. So, maybe EA * EB ≠ EC * ED.Wait, but in our case, E is the intersection of AB and CD, so the power of E with respect to the circumcircle of ABP is EA * EB = EP * EQ, and with respect to the circumcircle of CDP is EC * ED = EP * EQ. Therefore, EA * EB must equal EC * ED because both are equal to EP * EQ. So, E lies on the radical axis PQ.Therefore, PQ passes through E, which is fixed as the intersection of AB and CD. So, regardless of where P is on AD, PQ passes through E.Wait, but earlier I thought that when P is near A or D, PQ passes through E, but when P is in the middle, does it still pass through E? Let me check.If P is somewhere in the middle, then Q is determined by the intersection of the two circumcircles. Since E lies on PQ, as shown above, then yes, PQ must pass through E.Therefore, the fixed point is E, the intersection of AB and CD.Wait, but let me make sure. Let me consider another approach. Suppose I fix E as the intersection of AB and CD. Then, for any P on AD, Q is the other intersection point of the circumcircles of ABP and CDP. Then, since E lies on both AB and CD, and the power of E with respect to both circles is equal, E must lie on PQ.Therefore, PQ passes through E, which is fixed.So, the fixed point is the intersection of AB and CD, which is E.Therefore, the line PQ passes through the fixed point E, the intersection of AB and CD.**Final Answer**The fixed point is the intersection of lines ( AB ) and ( CD ). Thus, the line ( PQ ) passes through this fixed point, and the answer is (boxed{E})."},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, with the origin O as the pole and the positive x-axis as the polar axis, a polar coordinate system is established.

If they do, calculate the distance between the two points; if not, explain why.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem with two curves, C₁ and C₂. I need to find their Cartesian equations and then figure out if they intersect at two points, and if so, calculate the distance between those points. Let me take this step by step.Starting with part (I): Finding the Cartesian equation of curve C₁. The polar equation given is ρ(sinθ + cosθ) = 1. Hmm, I remember that in polar coordinates, ρsinθ is y and ρcosθ is x. So, substituting these into the equation should give me the Cartesian form. Let me write that down:ρ(sinθ + cosθ) = 1  => y + x = 1So, the Cartesian equation for C₁ is x + y = 1. That seems straightforward.Now, for curve C₂, the parametric equations are given as:x = 2cosθ  y = sinθI need to find the general equation, which I think means eliminating the parameter θ to express y in terms of x or vice versa. Since x is in terms of cosθ and y is in terms of sinθ, I can use the Pythagorean identity cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.From the parametric equations:cosθ = x/2  sinθ = yPlugging these into the identity:(x/2)² + y² = 1  => x²/4 + y² = 1So, the general equation for C₂ is x²/4 + y² = 1. That looks like an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis 2 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 1 along the y-axis.Alright, part (I) seems done. Now, moving on to part (II): Determining if C₁ and C₂ have two intersection points and finding the distance between them if they do.First, I need to solve the system of equations:1. x + y = 1  2. x²/4 + y² = 1I can solve this by substitution. From equation 1, I can express y in terms of x:y = 1 - xNow, substitute this into equation 2:x²/4 + (1 - x)² = 1Let me expand (1 - x)²:(1 - x)² = 1 - 2x + x²So, substituting back:x²/4 + 1 - 2x + x² = 1Combine like terms:x²/4 + x² - 2x + 1 = 1First, let's combine the x² terms. x²/4 + x² is the same as (1/4 + 1)x², which is (5/4)x².So, the equation becomes:(5/4)x² - 2x + 1 = 1Subtract 1 from both sides to simplify:(5/4)x² - 2x = 0I can factor out an x:x(5/4 x - 2) = 0So, either x = 0 or (5/4 x - 2) = 0.Solving for x:1. If x = 0, then from equation 1, y = 1 - 0 = 1. So, one intersection point is (0, 1).2. If 5/4 x - 2 = 0, then 5/4 x = 2 => x = (2 * 4)/5 = 8/5.Now, plugging x = 8/5 back into equation 1:y = 1 - 8/5 = (5/5 - 8/5) = -3/5.So, the other intersection point is (8/5, -3/5).Therefore, there are two intersection points: (0, 1) and (8/5, -3/5).Now, to find the distance between these two points. The distance formula is:d = sqrt[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]Plugging in the coordinates:x1 = 0, y1 = 1  x2 = 8/5, y2 = -3/5So,d = sqrt[(8/5 - 0)² + (-3/5 - 1)²]  = sqrt[(8/5)² + (-8/5)²]  = sqrt[(64/25) + (64/25)]  = sqrt[128/25]  = (sqrt(128))/5  = (8 * sqrt(2))/5Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that calculation. Because when I subtract y2 - y1, it's (-3/5 - 1) which is (-3/5 - 5/5) = (-8/5). So, that part is correct.But sqrt(128/25) is sqrt(128)/sqrt(25) = (8*sqrt(2))/5. Hmm, but I think I made a mistake here because 8/5 squared is 64/25, and (-8/5) squared is also 64/25. So, adding them gives 128/25, which is correct. So, sqrt(128/25) is indeed (8*sqrt(2))/5.Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the distance was 4*sqrt(5)/5, but now I'm getting 8*sqrt(2)/5. Which one is correct?Let me recalculate:Point 1: (0, 1)  Point 2: (8/5, -3/5)Difference in x: 8/5 - 0 = 8/5  Difference in y: -3/5 - 1 = -8/5So, squared differences:(8/5)^2 = 64/25  (-8/5)^2 = 64/25Sum: 64/25 + 64/25 = 128/25  Square root: sqrt(128/25) = (sqrt(128))/5 = (8*sqrt(2))/5So, the distance is 8*sqrt(2)/5.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had written the answer as 4*sqrt(5)/5. Did I make a mistake?Let me check the points again:From the equations, when x = 0, y = 1. Correct.When x = 8/5, y = -3/5. Correct.So, the differences are 8/5 and -8/5. Squared, they are both 64/25. So, sum is 128/25, sqrt is 8*sqrt(2)/5.Hmm, so my initial thought that it was 4*sqrt(5)/5 must have been incorrect. Maybe I miscalculated earlier.Wait, let me see: 8/5 is 1.6, and -3/5 is -0.6. So, the points are (0,1) and (1.6, -0.6). The distance between them should be sqrt[(1.6)^2 + (-1.6)^2] = sqrt[2.56 + 2.56] = sqrt[5.12] ≈ 2.2627.Calculating 8*sqrt(2)/5: sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, so 8*1.4142 ≈ 11.3136, divided by 5 is ≈2.2627. Correct.Calculating 4*sqrt(5)/5: sqrt(5) ≈2.2361, so 4*2.2361≈8.9444, divided by 5≈1.7889. That's different.So, the correct distance is 8*sqrt(2)/5, not 4*sqrt(5)/5. So, I think the initial answer might have been wrong.Wait, but let me check the equations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.From C₁: x + y = 1  From C₂: x²/4 + y² =1Substituting y = 1 - x into C₂:x²/4 + (1 - x)^2 =1  x²/4 + 1 - 2x + x² =1  (5x²)/4 - 2x =0  x(5x/4 - 2)=0  x=0 or x=8/5So, x=0 gives y=1  x=8/5 gives y=1 -8/5= -3/5So, points are (0,1) and (8/5, -3/5). Correct.Distance between them: sqrt[(8/5)^2 + (-3/5 -1)^2]  = sqrt[(64/25) + (-8/5)^2]  = sqrt[64/25 + 64/25]  = sqrt[128/25]  = (8*sqrt(2))/5Yes, that's correct. So, the initial thought of 4*sqrt(5)/5 was wrong. The correct distance is 8*sqrt(2)/5.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution step.Wait, when I substituted y =1 -x into C₂, I got:x²/4 + (1 -x)^2 =1  Which is x²/4 +1 -2x +x²=1  So, combining x² terms: (1/4 +1)x²=5/4 x²  So, 5/4 x² -2x +1=1  Subtract 1: 5/4 x² -2x=0  Factor: x(5/4 x -2)=0  So, x=0 or x=8/5Yes, that's correct.So, the points are (0,1) and (8/5, -3/5). The distance between them is sqrt[(8/5)^2 + (-3/5 -1)^2] = sqrt[(64/25) + ( (-8/5)^2 )] = sqrt[64/25 +64/25] = sqrt[128/25] = (8*sqrt(2))/5.Therefore, the correct distance is 8*sqrt(2)/5.Wait, but in the initial problem, the user had written the answer as 4*sqrt(5)/5. So, perhaps they made a mistake. Or maybe I'm miscalculating.Wait, let me calculate the distance again:Point A: (0,1)  Point B: (8/5, -3/5)Difference in x: 8/5 -0=8/5  Difference in y: -3/5 -1= -8/5So, distance squared is (8/5)^2 + (-8/5)^2=64/25 +64/25=128/25  So, distance is sqrt(128/25)= (sqrt(128))/5= (8*sqrt(2))/5Yes, that's correct. So, the distance is 8*sqrt(2)/5.Therefore, the initial answer of 4*sqrt(5)/5 was incorrect. The correct distance is 8*sqrt(2)/5.Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the parametric equations.Wait, the parametric equations for C₂ are x=2cosθ, y=sinθ. So, when θ=0, x=2, y=0. When θ=π/2, x=0, y=1. So, the point (0,1) is indeed on C₂.Similarly, when θ= something else, we get (8/5, -3/5). Let me check if that point is on both curves.For C₁: x + y =1  8/5 + (-3/5)=5/5=1. Correct.For C₂: x²/4 + y²= (64/25)/4 +9/25=16/25 +9/25=25/25=1. Correct.So, both points are correct.Therefore, the distance between them is indeed 8*sqrt(2)/5.So, in conclusion, curves C₁ and C₂ intersect at two points, and the distance between them is 8*sqrt(2)/5."},{"question":"There are 100 lottery tickets. It is known that 5 tickets win 20 rubles, 10 tickets win 15 rubles, 15 tickets win 10 rubles, 25 tickets win 2 rubles, and the rest win nothing. Find the probability that a purchased ticket will win at least 10 rubles.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about lottery tickets, and I need to find the probability that a purchased ticket will win at least 10 rubles. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. There are 100 lottery tickets in total. Out of these, 5 tickets win 20 rubles, 10 tickets win 15 rubles, 15 tickets win 10 rubles, 25 tickets win 2 rubles, and the rest win nothing. So, I need to find the probability that a ticket I buy will win at least 10 rubles.Okay, so probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is 100 because there are 100 tickets.Now, the favorable outcomes are the tickets that win at least 10 rubles. That means I need to consider the tickets that win 20 rubles, 15 rubles, and 10 rubles. The tickets that win 2 rubles or nothing don't count because they don't meet the \\"at least 10 rubles\\" threshold.So, let's list out the number of tickets that win at least 10 rubles:- 5 tickets win 20 rubles- 10 tickets win 15 rubles- 15 tickets win 10 rublesAdding these up: 5 + 10 + 15 = 30 tickets.Therefore, there are 30 favorable outcomes out of 100 possible outcomes. To find the probability, I can set up the fraction 30/100 and simplify it.Simplifying 30/100, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 10, which gives me 3/10. So, the probability is 3/10.Wait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions that the rest of the tickets win nothing. Since there are 100 tickets in total and we've accounted for 5 + 10 + 15 + 25 = 55 tickets, that means 100 - 55 = 45 tickets win nothing. But since we're only interested in tickets that win at least 10 rubles, those 45 tickets don't affect our calculation.So, yes, my initial calculation seems correct. The number of favorable outcomes is 30, and the total number of possible outcomes is 100. Therefore, the probability is 30/100, which simplifies to 3/10.Just to be thorough, I'll think about it another way. If I were to randomly pick a ticket, what's the chance it's one of the winning tickets for at least 10 rubles? Well, there are 30 such tickets out of 100, so the chance is 30%.That makes sense. So, the probability is 30%, or 0.3 in decimal form, or 3/10 as a fraction.I think I've covered all the bases here. I've identified the favorable outcomes, counted them, and compared them to the total number of possible outcomes. I've also double-checked to ensure I haven't missed any tickets or made any calculation errors. Everything seems to add up correctly.One last thing to consider: are the events of winning different amounts mutually exclusive? That is, can a ticket win more than one amount? In this case, no, each ticket can only win one amount. So, there's no overlap between the different winning amounts, which means I can safely add up the number of tickets that win 20, 15, and 10 rubles without worrying about double-counting.Alright, I'm confident that the probability is 3/10."},{"question":"Arrange 4 ones and 5 zeros in any order on the circumference of a circle, then perform the following operation: write a 0 between identical adjacent digits and a 1 between different adjacent digits, and then erase the original digits. Prove that no matter how many times this operation is performed, it is impossible to obtain 9 zeros.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to arrange 4 ones and 5 zeros in a circle. Then, I perform an operation where between every two identical adjacent digits, I write a 0, and between different adjacent digits, I write a 1. After writing these new digits, I erase the original ones. The goal is to prove that no matter how many times I perform this operation, I can't end up with 9 zeros.Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. First, I need to understand what exactly happens during each operation. So, if I have two identical digits next to each other, like 0 and 0 or 1 and 1, I write a 0 between them. If they're different, like 0 and 1 or 1 and 0, I write a 1 between them. Then, I erase the original digits and just have the new sequence.Since it's a circle, the first and last digits are also adjacent, right? So, the arrangement is cyclical. That means the operation wraps around the circle.Let me think about what this operation does. It seems like it's transforming the original sequence into a new sequence based on the differences between adjacent digits. It's kind of like a transformation rule.Now, the problem is asking me to prove that I can't get 9 zeros after any number of operations. So, starting with 4 ones and 5 zeros, I need to show that no matter how I perform these operations, I can't end up with all zeros.Maybe I should consider what it would take to get all zeros. If I have all zeros, that means that in the previous step, all the digits must have been the same, because writing a 0 between identical digits would result in zeros. So, if I have all zeros after an operation, the previous state must have been all zeros or all ones.But wait, if the previous state was all ones, then writing a 0 between each pair of ones would result in all zeros. Similarly, if the previous state was all zeros, writing a 0 between each pair of zeros would also result in all zeros.But in our case, we start with 4 ones and 5 zeros. So, how can we get to all zeros? Maybe I need to look at the number of ones and zeros and see how they change with each operation.Let me think about the number of ones and zeros after each operation. Suppose I have a sequence with some ones and zeros. When I perform the operation, each pair of adjacent digits will produce either a 0 or a 1. So, the number of ones in the new sequence depends on the number of adjacent pairs that are different.Wait, so if I have more ones, the number of differing adjacent pairs might change. Maybe I can model this as a transformation of the counts of ones and zeros.But it's a circle, so the number of adjacent pairs is equal to the number of digits, which is 9. So, each operation replaces the original 9 digits with a new sequence of 9 digits, where each new digit is determined by the pair of original digits it's between.I need to find an invariant or some property that remains unchanged or changes in a predictable way, which can help me show that all zeros is impossible.Let me consider the parity of the number of ones. Maybe the number of ones changes in a way that preserves some parity.Wait, let's think about the total number of ones. Each new digit is a 1 if the two adjacent digits are different and 0 otherwise. So, the number of ones in the new sequence is equal to the number of differing adjacent pairs in the original sequence.In a circle with 9 digits, the number of differing adjacent pairs can vary. But perhaps there's a relationship between the number of ones and zeros and the number of differing pairs.Let me denote the number of ones as k and the number of zeros as 9 - k. Then, the number of differing adjacent pairs can be calculated based on the arrangement of ones and zeros.But since the arrangement can vary, it's not straightforward. Maybe I need to consider the number of transitions between ones and zeros.Wait, in a circular arrangement, the number of transitions from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 must be even, right? Because you start and end at the same digit, so the number of times you switch from 0 to 1 must equal the number of times you switch from 1 to 0.So, the number of differing adjacent pairs is even. Therefore, the number of ones in the new sequence is even.But in our initial arrangement, we have 4 ones and 5 zeros. Let's see what the number of differing pairs is.If I have 4 ones and 5 zeros arranged in a circle, the number of transitions between ones and zeros depends on how they are grouped. If all ones are together, there would be 2 transitions: one from 0 to 1 and one from 1 to 0. Similarly, if the ones are spread out, the number of transitions increases.But regardless of the arrangement, the number of transitions must be even because it's a circle. So, the number of differing pairs is even, which means the number of ones in the next sequence is even.Wait, so the number of ones is even after each operation. But in the target state, we have 0 ones, which is even. So, that doesn't immediately rule it out.Hmm, maybe I need to look deeper. Let's consider the number of ones modulo something.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a linear transformation over the field of two elements. Each operation can be represented as a matrix, and we can analyze its properties.But that might be too abstract for now. Let me try a different approach.Suppose I have a sequence of digits, and I perform the operation to get a new sequence. Let's see what happens to the number of ones.If I have two identical digits, I write a 0. If they're different, I write a 1. So, the number of ones in the new sequence is equal to the number of differing adjacent pairs.Now, in a circle with n digits, the number of differing pairs can be related to the number of runs of ones and zeros.A run is a consecutive sequence of the same digit. For example, in the sequence 00110, there are three runs: 00, 11, and 0.In a circular arrangement, the number of runs must be even because each run of ones must be followed by a run of zeros and vice versa, and since it's a circle, the number of runs must be even.Therefore, the number of runs is even, which means the number of differing pairs is equal to the number of runs, which is even.So, the number of ones in the new sequence is equal to the number of runs, which is even.Therefore, the number of ones remains even after each operation.But in our initial configuration, we have 4 ones, which is even. So, the number of ones will always remain even after each operation.But the target state is 9 zeros, which has 0 ones, which is even. So, that doesn't rule it out.Hmm, maybe I need to consider another invariant.Let me think about the total number of ones modulo 3 or something.Wait, let's consider the number of ones modulo 2. Since the number of ones remains even, as we saw, it's always congruent to 0 modulo 2.But 0 is also 0 modulo 2, so that doesn't help.Maybe I need to consider the number of ones modulo something else.Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the number of ones in terms of the initial configuration.Wait, let's think about the initial number of ones, which is 4. After one operation, the number of ones is equal to the number of differing pairs.In the initial configuration, with 4 ones and 5 zeros, the number of differing pairs depends on how the ones and zeros are arranged.If the ones are all together, then there are 2 differing pairs: one where the ones start and one where they end.But since it's a circle, the number of differing pairs would actually be 2, because the transition from 0 to 1 and back to 0.Wait, no. If all ones are together, then the sequence would be something like 000001111, but since it's a circle, the last 1 is adjacent to the first 0.So, the number of differing pairs would be 2: one between the last 1 and the first 0, and one between the last 0 and the first 1.Wait, no, actually, in a circular arrangement, if all ones are together, there are two transitions: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0. So, the number of differing pairs is 2.Therefore, the number of ones in the next sequence would be 2.So, starting from 4 ones, after one operation, we get 2 ones.Then, in the next operation, we have 2 ones. How does that translate?If we have 2 ones, arranged in the circle, the number of differing pairs depends on their arrangement.If the two ones are adjacent, then the sequence would have a run of two ones, and the rest zeros.So, the number of differing pairs would be 2: one between the run of ones and the zeros, and one between the zeros and the run of ones.Wait, but since it's a circle, if the two ones are adjacent, the sequence would be something like 110000000, but since it's a circle, the last 0 is adjacent to the first 1.So, the number of differing pairs would be 2: between the last 0 and the first 1, and between the last 1 and the first 0.Wait, no, actually, if the two ones are adjacent, the sequence would have a run of two ones, and the rest zeros. So, the transitions are from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0, each occurring once.But since it's a circle, the total number of transitions is 2: one from 0 to 1 and one from 1 to 0.Therefore, the number of ones in the next sequence would be 2.Wait, so starting from 2 ones, we get 2 ones again.Hmm, interesting. So, if we have 2 ones, we stay at 2 ones.But wait, is that always the case?Suppose the two ones are not adjacent. Then, the sequence would have two separate runs of ones, each of length 1.So, the number of transitions would be 4: from 0 to 1, 1 to 0, 0 to 1, and 1 to 0.Therefore, the number of ones in the next sequence would be 4.Wait, so depending on how the ones are arranged, the number of ones can either stay the same or change.So, in the case where the two ones are adjacent, the number of ones remains 2, but if they are separated, the number of ones increases to 4.Therefore, the number of ones can oscillate between 2 and 4, depending on the arrangement.But in our initial case, starting from 4 ones, we went to 2 ones, and then depending on the arrangement, we could go back to 4 ones or stay at 2 ones.But wait, in the case where we have 2 ones, if they are adjacent, we stay at 2 ones. If they are separated, we go back to 4 ones.But in the case where we have 4 ones, if they are all together, we go to 2 ones. If they are separated, we might have more ones.Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of possible states.Let me try to enumerate the possible number of ones:- Starting with 4 ones.After one operation, depending on the arrangement, we can have 2 or 4 ones.Wait, no. If all ones are together, we get 2 ones. If they are separated, how many ones do we get?Suppose the ones are spread out as much as possible. For example, alternating ones and zeros as much as possible.But with 4 ones and 5 zeros, it's not possible to alternate perfectly because 5 is odd.Wait, let's see. If we try to spread the ones as much as possible, we might have something like 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0.But that would require 5 ones, which we don't have. We have only 4 ones.So, the best we can do is have some zeros between the ones.For example, 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1, but that's 11 digits. Wait, no, we have 9 digits.Wait, let's think of 9 positions. If we have 4 ones, the maximum spacing would be having two zeros between some ones.But it's getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to count, I should think about the possible number of ones.Wait, another approach: since the number of ones is even, and we start with 4, which is even, and the number of ones remains even after each operation, as we saw earlier, because the number of differing pairs is even.Therefore, the number of ones will always be even.But the target state is 0 ones, which is even, so that doesn't rule it out.Hmm, maybe I need to consider another invariant.Wait, perhaps the number of ones modulo 3.Let me see:Starting with 4 ones.After one operation, depending on the arrangement, we can have 2 or 4 ones.If we have 2 ones, then next operation can lead to 2 or 4 ones.If we have 4 ones, next operation can lead to 2 or 4 ones.Wait, so the number of ones can oscillate between 2 and 4, but never reach 0.But wait, is that necessarily true?Suppose we have 2 ones, and they are adjacent. Then, the next operation would result in 2 ones again.But if we have 2 ones that are separated, the next operation would result in 4 ones.So, unless we can arrange the ones in such a way that the number of ones decreases further, we can't reach 0.But from 2 ones, if they are adjacent, we stay at 2 ones. If they are separated, we go back to 4 ones.Therefore, it seems like we can't get below 2 ones.But wait, is there a way to get to 0 ones?If we have 2 ones, and they are adjacent, we stay at 2 ones. If they are separated, we go back to 4 ones.So, it seems like we can't get to 0 ones.Wait, but the target is 9 zeros, which is 0 ones. So, if we can't get below 2 ones, then it's impossible to reach 0 ones.Therefore, it's impossible to obtain 9 zeros.Wait, but I need to make sure that this reasoning is correct.Let me try to formalize it.Let me denote the number of ones as k.We start with k = 4.After one operation, k can be 2 or 4.If k = 2, then in the next operation, k can be 2 or 4.If k = 4, then in the next operation, k can be 2 or 4.Therefore, k can only be 2 or 4, never reaching 0.Hence, it's impossible to reach 0 ones, which corresponds to 9 zeros.Therefore, no matter how many times the operation is performed, it's impossible to obtain 9 zeros.I think this makes sense. The number of ones can't decrease below 2, so 0 ones is impossible."},{"question":"How many positive four-digit integers are divisible by 25 and have digits that sum to a number divisible by 3?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find how many positive four-digit integers are divisible by 25 and have digits that sum to a number divisible by 3. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let's recall what makes a number divisible by 25. A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are either 00, 25, 50, or 75. So, for a four-digit number, the last two digits can only be one of these four combinations. That gives me four possibilities for the last two digits.Now, since we're dealing with four-digit numbers, the first digit (thousands place) can't be zero. It has to be from 1 to 9. So, there are 9 possible choices for the thousands digit.The next digit is the hundreds place, which can be any digit from 0 to 9. So, that's 10 possibilities.So, without considering the divisibility by 3, the total number of four-digit numbers divisible by 25 would be 9 (choices for thousands digit) * 10 (choices for hundreds digit) * 4 (choices for last two digits) = 360 numbers.But wait, we also need the sum of the digits to be divisible by 3. That adds another layer of complexity. I need to figure out how many of these 360 numbers have digits that add up to a multiple of 3.Let me think about how the digits contribute to the sum. The four-digit number can be represented as ABCD, where A is the thousands digit, B is the hundreds digit, C is the tens digit, and D is the units digit. The sum of the digits is A + B + C + D.Since the last two digits CD are fixed as one of 00, 25, 50, or 75, the sum C + D is fixed for each case. Let me calculate the sum for each possible CD:- If CD is 00, then C + D = 0 + 0 = 0.- If CD is 25, then C + D = 2 + 5 = 7.- If CD is 50, then C + D = 5 + 0 = 5.- If CD is 75, then C + D = 7 + 5 = 12.So, the sum contributed by the last two digits can be 0, 7, 5, or 12. Now, the total sum A + B + C + D needs to be divisible by 3. That means (A + B) + (C + D) must be divisible by 3.Since (C + D) is fixed depending on CD, we can think of it as a constant for each case. Therefore, for each CD, we need (A + B) to be such that when added to (C + D), the total is divisible by 3.Let me formalize this:For each CD (00, 25, 50, 75), let S = C + D. Then, we need (A + B) ≡ (-S) mod 3. In other words, (A + B) should be congruent to (3 - S mod 3) mod 3.Wait, actually, more accurately, since (A + B) + S ≡ 0 mod 3, then (A + B) ≡ (-S) mod 3. But since we're dealing with congruences, -S mod 3 is the same as (3 - (S mod 3)) mod 3. So, for each CD, we can compute S, find S mod 3, then determine what (A + B) needs to be modulo 3.Let me compute S mod 3 for each CD:- CD = 00: S = 0, so S mod 3 = 0. Therefore, (A + B) ≡ 0 mod 3.- CD = 25: S = 7, 7 mod 3 = 1. Therefore, (A + B) ≡ -1 mod 3, which is equivalent to 2 mod 3.- CD = 50: S = 5, 5 mod 3 = 2. Therefore, (A + B) ≡ -2 mod 3, which is equivalent to 1 mod 3.- CD = 75: S = 12, 12 mod 3 = 0. Therefore, (A + B) ≡ 0 mod 3.So, depending on the CD, we have different requirements for (A + B):- For CD = 00 and CD = 75, (A + B) must be ≡ 0 mod 3.- For CD = 25, (A + B) must be ≡ 2 mod 3.- For CD = 50, (A + B) must be ≡ 1 mod 3.Now, I need to figure out, for each CD, how many pairs (A, B) satisfy the required congruence.Let's handle each CD case separately.**Case 1: CD = 00**Here, (A + B) ≡ 0 mod 3.A ranges from 1 to 9, and B ranges from 0 to 9.I need to count the number of pairs (A, B) where A is from 1-9, B is from 0-9, and A + B is divisible by 3.To do this, I can consider the possible residues of A mod 3 and B mod 3.For A, since A is from 1-9, let's list the residues:- A ≡ 0 mod 3: A = 3, 6, 9 → 3 numbers- A ≡ 1 mod 3: A = 1, 4, 7 → 3 numbers- A ≡ 2 mod 3: A = 2, 5, 8 → 3 numbersSimilarly, for B, which is from 0-9:- B ≡ 0 mod 3: B = 0, 3, 6, 9 → 4 numbers- B ≡ 1 mod 3: B = 1, 4, 7 → 3 numbers- B ≡ 2 mod 3: B = 2, 5, 8 → 3 numbersNow, to get A + B ≡ 0 mod 3, the possible combinations are:- A ≡ 0, B ≡ 0- A ≡ 1, B ≡ 2- A ≡ 2, B ≡ 1Let's compute the number of pairs for each combination:1. A ≡ 0, B ≡ 0: 3 * 4 = 122. A ≡ 1, B ≡ 2: 3 * 3 = 93. A ≡ 2, B ≡ 1: 3 * 3 = 9Total pairs: 12 + 9 + 9 = 30So, for CD = 00, there are 30 valid (A, B) pairs.**Case 2: CD = 25**Here, (A + B) ≡ 2 mod 3.Again, A is from 1-9, B is from 0-9.Using the same residue counts as before:A residues:- 0: 3- 1: 3- 2: 3B residues:- 0: 4- 1: 3- 2: 3To get A + B ≡ 2 mod 3, the possible combinations are:- A ≡ 0, B ≡ 2- A ≡ 1, B ≡ 1- A ≡ 2, B ≡ 0Compute the number of pairs:1. A ≡ 0, B ≡ 2: 3 * 3 = 92. A ≡ 1, B ≡ 1: 3 * 3 = 93. A ≡ 2, B ≡ 0: 3 * 4 = 12Total pairs: 9 + 9 + 12 = 30So, for CD = 25, there are 30 valid (A, B) pairs.**Case 3: CD = 50**Here, (A + B) ≡ 1 mod 3.Again, A is from 1-9, B is from 0-9.Residues as before.To get A + B ≡ 1 mod 3, the possible combinations are:- A ≡ 0, B ≡ 1- A ≡ 1, B ≡ 0- A ≡ 2, B ≡ 2Compute the number of pairs:1. A ≡ 0, B ≡ 1: 3 * 3 = 92. A ≡ 1, B ≡ 0: 3 * 4 = 123. A ≡ 2, B ≡ 2: 3 * 3 = 9Total pairs: 9 + 12 + 9 = 30So, for CD = 50, there are 30 valid (A, B) pairs.**Case 4: CD = 75**Here, (A + B) ≡ 0 mod 3.This is the same as Case 1.So, similar to CD = 00, we have 30 valid (A, B) pairs.**Total Count**Now, for each CD, we have 30 valid (A, B) pairs. Since there are 4 possible CDs (00, 25, 50, 75), the total number of four-digit numbers is 4 * 30 = 120.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check this because 4 * 30 is 120, but earlier I thought the total without considering the digit sum was 360. So, 120 is exactly one-third of 360, which makes sense because the digit sum condition is a modulo 3 condition, so roughly one-third of the numbers should satisfy it.But just to be thorough, let me verify my calculations for each case.In each case, regardless of CD, the number of valid (A, B) pairs was 30. Since there are 4 CDs, 4 * 30 = 120.Yes, that seems consistent.So, the final answer should be 120.But wait, let me think again. Is there any overlap or something I missed?No, each CD is distinct, and for each CD, the count is independent. So, adding them up should give the correct total.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each CD, the number of valid (A, B) pairs is 30, so 4 CDs give 120 numbers.Yes, that seems correct.**Final Answer**The number of positive four-digit integers divisible by 25 with digits summing to a multiple of 3 is boxed{120}."},{"question":"Evaluate the expression dfrac{sqrt[6]{5}}{sqrt[4]{5}}. What power of 5 does this expression represent?","answer":"First, I need to simplify the expression (dfrac{sqrt[6]{5}}{sqrt[4]{5}}). To do this, I'll convert the radicals into fractional exponents.The sixth root of 5 can be written as (5^{frac{1}{6}}), and the fourth root of 5 is (5^{frac{1}{4}}). This transforms the original expression into (dfrac{5^{frac{1}{6}}}{5^{frac{1}{4}}}).Next, I'll apply the quotient rule of exponents, which states that (dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}). Subtracting the exponents gives (frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{4}).To subtract these fractions, I'll find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 6 and 4 is 12. Converting both fractions, I get (frac{2}{12} - frac{3}{12} = -frac{1}{12}).Therefore, the simplified expression is (5^{-frac{1}{12}}), which means the original expression is equal to 5 raised to the power of (-frac{1}{12})."},{"question":"Given non-zero vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} that satisfy |overrightarrow{a}| = |overrightarrow{b}| and (2overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0, find the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about vectors. It says that there are two non-zero vectors, a and b, and their magnitudes are equal. That means |a| = |b|. Then, there's this equation involving a dot product: (2a + b) · b = 0. I need to find the angle between vectors a and b.Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the dot product of two vectors is related to the cosine of the angle between them. The formula is a · b = |a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between them. Since the magnitudes of a and b are equal, maybe that can simplify things.First, let's write down what we know:1. |a| = |b|. Let's denote this common magnitude as 'k'. So, |a| = |b| = k.2. (2a + b) · b = 0.I need to expand this dot product. Let's do that step by step. The dot product is distributive, so:(2a + b) · b = 2a · b + b · b.Okay, so that's 2 times the dot product of a and b, plus the dot product of b with itself.Now, let's compute each term separately.First, a · b. As I mentioned earlier, that's |a||b|cosθ. Since |a| = |b| = k, this becomes k * k * cosθ = k²cosθ.Next, b · b. The dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. So, b · b = |b|² = k².Putting it all together, the equation becomes:2a · b + b · b = 2(k²cosθ) + k² = 0.So, 2k²cosθ + k² = 0.Hmm, let's factor out k²:k²(2cosθ + 1) = 0.Since k is the magnitude of the vectors and the vectors are non-zero, k cannot be zero. Therefore, k² ≠ 0, which means the other factor must be zero:2cosθ + 1 = 0.Solving for cosθ:2cosθ = -1cosθ = -1/2.Now, I need to find the angle θ where the cosine is -1/2. I remember that cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants. But since the angle between two vectors is always between 0° and 180°, we only consider the second quadrant.What angle has a cosine of -1/2? Let me recall the unit circle. Cosine is -1/2 at 120° and 240°, but since we're only considering angles up to 180°, it must be 120°.So, θ = 120°.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Expanded the dot product correctly: (2a + b) · b = 2a · b + b · b. That seems right.2. Calculated a · b as |a||b|cosθ, which is k²cosθ. Correct.3. Calculated b · b as |b|², which is k². Correct.4. Plugged into the equation: 2k²cosθ + k² = 0. Factored out k²: k²(2cosθ + 1) = 0. Since k ≠ 0, 2cosθ + 1 = 0. So, cosθ = -1/2. That seems solid.5. Found θ = 120°, which is correct because cos(120°) = -1/2.I think that's all correct. So, the angle between vectors a and b is 120 degrees.**Final Answer**The angle between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is boxed{120^circ}."},{"question":"Let f(x) be an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, and when x geq 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing. If x_1 + x_2 > 0, then the value of f(x_1) + f(x_2) is ( )A: Always negativeB: Always zeroC: Always positiveD: Cannot determine the sign","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an odd function f(x) defined on all real numbers. It says that when x is greater than or equal to 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing. Then, the question is about the value of f(x₁) + f(x₂) when x₁ + x₂ is greater than 0. The options are whether it's always negative, always zero, always positive, or we can't determine the sign.Hmm, let me start by recalling what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I know the behavior of the function for positive x, I can figure out the behavior for negative x as well.The problem states that f(x) is monotonically decreasing for x ≥ 0. Monotonically decreasing means that as x increases, f(x) decreases. So, for example, if I take two points x₁ and x₂ where x₁ < x₂, then f(x₁) > f(x₂) when both are in the non-negative domain.Since f is odd, what does that tell me about its behavior for x < 0? Well, if I take a negative x, say -x where x > 0, then f(-x) = -f(x). Since f(x) is decreasing for x ≥ 0, f(-x) will be increasing as x increases because it's the negative of a decreasing function. So, for negative x, the function is increasing.Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If f(x) is decreasing for x ≥ 0, then for negative x, f(-x) = -f(x). So, as x increases (becomes less negative), f(-x) increases because f(x) decreases. So yes, f(x) is increasing for x < 0.So, putting it all together, f(x) is decreasing on the positive side and increasing on the negative side. That makes sense because it's an odd function, so it's symmetric about the origin.Now, the problem is about f(x₁) + f(x₂) when x₁ + x₂ > 0. I need to figure out whether this sum is always negative, always zero, always positive, or we can't tell.Let me think about what x₁ + x₂ > 0 implies. It means that the sum of these two numbers is positive. So, either both x₁ and x₂ are positive, or one is positive and the other is negative, but the positive one is larger in magnitude.Case 1: Both x₁ and x₂ are positive. Since f is decreasing for positive x, both f(x₁) and f(x₂) will be less than f(0). But wait, f(0) for an odd function is 0 because f(-0) = -f(0) implies f(0) = 0. So, if x₁ and x₂ are positive, f(x₁) and f(x₂) are both negative because f is decreasing from f(0) = 0 downwards as x increases. Therefore, their sum would be negative.Case 2: One is positive and the other is negative. Let's say x₁ is positive and x₂ is negative, but x₁ + x₂ > 0. So, x₁ > -x₂. Since x₁ is positive, f(x₁) is negative because f is decreasing from 0. x₂ is negative, so f(x₂) is equal to -f(-x₂). Since -x₂ is positive, and f is decreasing, f(-x₂) is less than f(0) which is 0, so f(-x₂) is negative, meaning f(x₂) = -f(-x₂) is positive.So, in this case, f(x₁) is negative and f(x₂) is positive. The question is, does f(x₁) + f(x₂) have to be negative? Let's see.Since x₁ > -x₂, and f is decreasing, f(x₁) < f(-x₂). But f(-x₂) is negative, so f(x₁) is less than a negative number, meaning f(x₁) is more negative. On the other hand, f(x₂) = -f(-x₂), which is positive.So, f(x₁) + f(x₂) = f(x₁) - f(-x₂). Since f(x₁) < f(-x₂), and f(-x₂) is negative, f(x₁) is less than a negative number, so f(x₁) is more negative. Therefore, f(x₁) - f(-x₂) would be f(x₁) minus a negative number, which is like adding a positive. But wait, let me think again.Wait, f(x₁) is negative, and f(x₂) is positive. So, f(x₁) + f(x₂) is a negative plus a positive. Whether the sum is positive or negative depends on which one is larger in magnitude.But since x₁ > -x₂, and f is decreasing, f(x₁) < f(-x₂). But f(-x₂) is negative, so f(x₁) is less than a negative number, meaning f(x₁) is more negative. Therefore, f(x₁) is less than f(-x₂), which is negative. So, f(x₁) is more negative than f(-x₂). Therefore, f(x₂) = -f(-x₂) is positive, and f(x₁) is negative.So, f(x₁) + f(x₂) = f(x₁) + (-f(-x₂)) = f(x₁) - f(-x₂). Since f(x₁) < f(-x₂), and f(-x₂) is negative, subtracting f(-x₂) is like adding a positive number. But f(x₁) is negative, so it's like a negative plus a positive. But how much?Wait, maybe I should express it differently. Let me denote y = x₂, which is negative, so -y is positive. Then, f(x₂) = f(y) = -f(-y). So, f(x₁) + f(x₂) = f(x₁) - f(-y). Since x₁ + x₂ > 0, x₁ > -x₂, which is x₁ > y. Since f is decreasing, f(x₁) < f(y). But f(y) is negative because y is positive, so f(x₁) is less than a negative number, meaning f(x₁) is more negative. Therefore, f(x₁) - f(-y) = f(x₁) - (-f(y)) = f(x₁) + f(y). Wait, that seems conflicting.Wait, no, f(x₂) = f(y) = -f(-y). So, f(x₁) + f(x₂) = f(x₁) - f(-y). Since x₁ > -y, and f is decreasing, f(x₁) < f(-y). But f(-y) is negative, so f(x₁) is less than a negative number, meaning f(x₁) is more negative. Therefore, f(x₁) - f(-y) is f(x₁) minus a negative, which is f(x₁) + |f(-y)|. But since f(x₁) is negative and |f(-y)| is positive, the sum could be either negative or positive depending on their magnitudes.Wait, but x₁ > -y, so x₁ is greater than the positive number -y. Since f is decreasing, f(x₁) < f(-y). But f(-y) is negative, so f(x₁) is more negative. Therefore, f(x₁) is less than f(-y), which is negative. So, f(x₁) is more negative, meaning |f(x₁)| > |f(-y)|. Therefore, f(x₁) + f(x₂) = f(x₁) - f(-y) = f(x₁) + |f(-y)|. Since |f(x₁)| > |f(-y)|, the sum would be negative.Wait, let me think again. If |f(x₁)| > |f(-y)|, then f(x₁) + f(x₂) = f(x₁) + (-f(-y)) = f(x₁) - f(-y). Since f(x₁) is negative and f(-y) is negative, subtracting f(-y) is like adding a positive. But f(x₁) is more negative, so the total would be negative.Yes, that makes sense. So, in both cases, whether both x₁ and x₂ are positive or one is positive and the other is negative, the sum f(x₁) + f(x₂) is negative.Wait, but let me test with specific numbers to make sure.Suppose f(x) = -x for x ≥ 0, which is an odd function and decreasing. Then f(x) = x for x < 0.Case 1: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 2. Then f(1) = -1, f(2) = -2. Sum is -3, which is negative.Case 2: x₁ = 3, x₂ = -1. Then x₁ + x₂ = 2 > 0. f(3) = -3, f(-1) = 1. Sum is -3 + 1 = -2, which is negative.Another example: x₁ = 2, x₂ = -1. Sum is 1 > 0. f(2) = -2, f(-1) = 1. Sum is -1, negative.What if x₁ = 1, x₂ = -0.5. Sum is 0.5 > 0. f(1) = -1, f(-0.5) = 0.5. Sum is -0.5, negative.Another example: x₁ = 0.5, x₂ = -0.4. Sum is 0.1 > 0. f(0.5) = -0.5, f(-0.4) = 0.4. Sum is -0.1, negative.Wait, so in all these cases, the sum is negative. So, it seems that the answer is always negative.But let me think if there's any case where the sum could be positive. Suppose x₁ is very large positive, and x₂ is a small negative such that x₁ + x₂ > 0. For example, x₁ = 100, x₂ = -99. Then f(100) = -100, f(-99) = 99. Sum is -100 + 99 = -1, still negative.Another example: x₁ = 1000, x₂ = -999. Sum is 1 > 0. f(1000) = -1000, f(-999) = 999. Sum is -1000 + 999 = -1, negative.Wait, so even if x₂ is almost as large as x₁ in magnitude but negative, the sum is still negative because f(x₁) is more negative than f(x₂) is positive.Therefore, it seems that in all cases where x₁ + x₂ > 0, f(x₁) + f(x₂) is negative.So, the answer should be A: Always negative."},{"question":"We can split 1 as follows: 1= frac {1}{2}+ frac {1}{3}+ frac {1}{6}, 1= frac {1}{2}+ frac {1}{4}+ frac {1}{6}+ frac {1}{12}, 1= frac {1}{2}+ frac {1}{5}+ frac {1}{6}+ frac {1}{12}+ frac {1}{20}, and so on.

Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, the problem gives me some examples of how 1 can be split into sums of reciprocals. The first example is 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6. That makes sense because 1/2 is 0.5, 1/3 is approximately 0.333, and 1/6 is about 0.166, and adding them up gives roughly 1. The next example is 1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12. Let me check that: 1/2 is 0.5, 1/4 is 0.25, 1/6 is about 0.166, and 1/12 is about 0.083. Adding those together: 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75, plus 0.166 is about 0.916, plus 0.083 is roughly 1. So that works too.The third example is 1 = 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/20. Let me verify that: 1/2 is 0.5, 1/5 is 0.2, 1/6 is about 0.166, 1/12 is about 0.083, and 1/20 is 0.05. Adding them up: 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.7, plus 0.166 is 0.866, plus 0.083 is 0.949, plus 0.05 is approximately 1. So that works as well.Now, the problem gives a more complex equation:1 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/m + 1/20 + 1/n + 1/42 + 1/56 + 1/72 + 1/90 + 1/110 + 1/132 + 1/156Where m and n are natural numbers, and m < n. I need to find m and n first, and then determine the range of the function y = (m + n)x / (x - 1).Alright, so let me focus on the equation first. I need to find m and n such that when I add all these reciprocals, it equals 1. Let me write down all the terms:1/2, 1/6, 1/12, 1/m, 1/20, 1/n, 1/42, 1/56, 1/72, 1/90, 1/110, 1/132, 1/156.I notice that some of these denominators seem to follow a pattern. Let me list them out:2, 6, 12, m, 20, n, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 156.Looking at these numbers, I can see that some of them are products of consecutive integers. For example:2 = 1×2,6 = 2×3,12 = 3×4,20 = 4×5,42 = 6×7,56 = 7×8,72 = 8×9,90 = 9×10,110 = 10×11,132 = 11×12,156 = 12×13.Wait, so 2 is 1×2, 6 is 2×3, 12 is 3×4, 20 is 4×5, and so on. So, these denominators are of the form k(k+1) for k starting from 1.But in the given equation, the denominators are 2, 6, 12, m, 20, n, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 156.So, let's see:- 2 = 1×2,- 6 = 2×3,- 12 = 3×4,- m: ?- 20 = 4×5,- n: ?- 42 = 6×7,- 56 = 7×8,- 72 = 8×9,- 90 = 9×10,- 110 = 10×11,- 132 = 11×12,- 156 = 12×13.Hmm, so m comes after 12, which is 3×4, and before 20, which is 4×5. So, m should be 5×6=30? Wait, but 5×6 is 30, but 20 is 4×5. Wait, maybe not.Wait, let's see the sequence:After 12 (3×4), the next term is m, then 20 (4×5), then n, then 42 (6×7). So, perhaps m is 5×6=30, but 20 is 4×5, so maybe m is 5×6=30? But 20 is 4×5, so m is 5×6=30, and n is 7×8=56? But 56 is already in the list. Wait, no, n is before 42, which is 6×7. So, n should be 5×6=30? But 30 is not in the list. Wait, maybe m is 5×6=30, and n is 7×8=56, but 56 is already there. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, perhaps m is 5×6=30, and n is 7×8=56, but since 56 is already in the list, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe m is 5×6=30, and n is 8×9=72, but 72 is already there. Hmm, perhaps I need to calculate the sum of the known terms and see what's missing.Let me calculate the sum of all the known reciprocals except 1/m and 1/n.So, the known terms are:1/2, 1/6, 1/12, 1/20, 1/42, 1/56, 1/72, 1/90, 1/110, 1/132, 1/156.Let me compute their sum:1/2 = 0.51/6 ≈ 0.16671/12 ≈ 0.08331/20 = 0.051/42 ≈ 0.02381/56 ≈ 0.01791/72 ≈ 0.01391/90 ≈ 0.01111/110 ≈ 0.00911/132 ≈ 0.00761/156 ≈ 0.0064Adding these up step by step:Start with 0.5 (1/2).Add 0.1667: total ≈ 0.6667Add 0.0833: total ≈ 0.75Add 0.05: total ≈ 0.8Add 0.0238: total ≈ 0.8238Add 0.0179: total ≈ 0.8417Add 0.0139: total ≈ 0.8556Add 0.0111: total ≈ 0.8667Add 0.0091: total ≈ 0.8758Add 0.0076: total ≈ 0.8834Add 0.0064: total ≈ 0.8898So, the sum of all known terms except 1/m and 1/n is approximately 0.8898.Since the total sum is 1, the sum of 1/m and 1/n must be approximately 1 - 0.8898 = 0.1102.So, 1/m + 1/n ≈ 0.1102.But let's be more precise. Let me calculate the exact sum of the known terms.Compute each fraction as exact fractions:1/2 = 1/21/6 = 1/61/12 = 1/121/20 = 1/201/42 = 1/421/56 = 1/561/72 = 1/721/90 = 1/901/110 = 1/1101/132 = 1/1321/156 = 1/156Let me find a common denominator to add all these fractions. The denominators are 2, 6, 12, 20, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, 132, 156.Let me factor each denominator:2 = 26 = 2×312 = 2²×320 = 2²×542 = 2×3×756 = 2³×772 = 2³×3²90 = 2×3²×5110 = 2×5×11132 = 2²×3×11156 = 2²×3×13So, the least common multiple (LCM) would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present:Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13Highest powers:2³, 3², 5¹, 7¹, 11¹, 13¹So, LCM = 8×9×5×7×11×13Calculate that:8×9 = 7272×5 = 360360×7 = 25202520×11 = 2772027720×13 = 360360So, the LCM is 360360.Now, let me express each fraction with denominator 360360:1/2 = 180180/3603601/6 = 60060/3603601/12 = 30030/3603601/20 = 18018/3603601/42 = 8580/3603601/56 = 6435/3603601/72 = 5005/3603601/90 = 4004/3603601/110 = 3276/3603601/132 = 2730/3603601/156 = 2310/360360Now, add all these numerators:180180 + 60060 = 240240240240 + 30030 = 270270270270 + 18018 = 288288288288 + 8580 = 296868296868 + 6435 = 303303303303 + 5005 = 308308308308 + 4004 = 312312312312 + 3276 = 315588315588 + 2730 = 318318318318 + 2310 = 320628So, the sum of all known terms is 320628/360360.Simplify that fraction:Divide numerator and denominator by 12:320628 ÷ 12 = 26719360360 ÷ 12 = 30030Wait, 320628 ÷ 12: 320628 ÷ 12 = 26719 (since 12×26719 = 320628)Similarly, 360360 ÷ 12 = 30030.So, 320628/360360 = 26719/30030.Now, the total sum is 1, so the sum of 1/m and 1/n is 1 - 26719/30030 = (30030 - 26719)/30030 = 3311/30030.Simplify 3311/30030:Let me see if 3311 and 30030 have any common factors.3311 ÷ 11 = 301, since 11×301 = 3311.30030 ÷ 11 = 2730, since 11×2730 = 30030.So, 3311/30030 = 301/2730.Now, 301 and 2730: Let's see if they have any common factors.301 ÷ 7 = 43, since 7×43 = 301.2730 ÷ 7 = 390, since 7×390 = 2730.So, 301/2730 = 43/390.Therefore, 1/m + 1/n = 43/390.So, we have 1/m + 1/n = 43/390.We need to find natural numbers m and n such that m < n and 1/m + 1/n = 43/390.Let me write this as:(m + n)/(m n) = 43/390So, cross-multiplying:390(m + n) = 43 m nLet me rearrange this:43 m n - 390 m - 390 n = 0Let me add 390² to both sides to complete the rectangle:43 m n - 390 m - 390 n + (390²)/(43) = (390²)/(43)Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick (SFFT).Let me rewrite the equation:43 m n - 390 m - 390 n = 0Add 390²/(43) to both sides:43 m n - 390 m - 390 n + (390²)/(43) = (390²)/(43)Factor the left side:(43 m - 390)(43 n - 390) = (390²)/(43)But 390² = (390)^2 = 152100So, (43 m - 390)(43 n - 390) = 152100 / 43Calculate 152100 ÷ 43:43 × 3537 = 152,091 (since 43 × 3500 = 150,500, and 43 × 37 = 1,591; 150,500 + 1,591 = 152,091)So, 152,100 - 152,091 = 9So, 152100 ÷ 43 = 3537 + 9/43 ≈ 3537.209But since we're dealing with integers, perhaps I made a miscalculation.Wait, 43 × 3537 = 152,091, as above.So, 152,100 - 152,091 = 9, so 152,100 = 43 × 3537 + 9.Therefore, 152,100 / 43 = 3537 + 9/43, which is not an integer. Hmm, that complicates things.Alternatively, maybe I should factor 43 m n - 390 m - 390 n = 0 differently.Let me factor out 43:43(m n) - 390 m - 390 n = 0Let me write it as:43 m n = 390 m + 390 nDivide both sides by m n:43 = 390/n + 390/mSo,390/m + 390/n = 43Let me factor out 390:390(1/m + 1/n) = 43But we already know that 1/m + 1/n = 43/390, so this is consistent.Alternatively, let me let m and n be such that m < n, and find pairs (m, n) where 1/m + 1/n = 43/390.Let me express this as:1/n = 43/390 - 1/mSo,1/n = (43 m - 390)/(390 m)Therefore,n = (390 m)/(43 m - 390)Since n must be a natural number, the denominator (43 m - 390) must divide 390 m.Also, 43 m - 390 > 0, so 43 m > 390 => m > 390/43 ≈ 9.069. So m must be at least 10.Also, since m < n, and n = (390 m)/(43 m - 390), we need n > m.So,(390 m)/(43 m - 390) > mMultiply both sides by (43 m - 390), which is positive since m > 9.069.So,390 m > m (43 m - 390)Divide both sides by m (since m > 0):390 > 43 m - 390Add 390 to both sides:780 > 43 mSo,m < 780/43 ≈ 18.139. So m must be less than 18.139, so m ≤ 18.So, m is an integer between 10 and 18 inclusive.Now, let's test m = 10:n = (390×10)/(43×10 - 390) = 3900/(430 - 390) = 3900/40 = 97.5. Not integer.m = 11:n = (390×11)/(43×11 - 390) = 4290/(473 - 390) = 4290/83 ≈ 51.7. Not integer.m = 12:n = (390×12)/(43×12 - 390) = 4680/(516 - 390) = 4680/126 = 37.142... Not integer.m = 13:n = (390×13)/(43×13 - 390) = 5070/(559 - 390) = 5070/169 = 30. So n = 30.Check if n is integer: 5070 ÷ 169 = 30, since 169×30 = 5070. Yes, that works.Now, check if m < n: 13 < 30, which is true.So, m = 13, n = 30.Let me verify:1/m + 1/n = 1/13 + 1/30 = (30 + 13)/(13×30) = 43/390. Correct.So, m = 13, n = 30.Now, moving on to the function y = (m + n)x / (x - 1).Given m = 13 and n = 30, m + n = 43.So, the function becomes y = (43x)/(x - 1).We need to determine the range of this function.First, let's note that x cannot be 1, as that would make the denominator zero, leading to an undefined expression.So, the domain of the function is all real numbers except x = 1.Now, let's analyze the function y = 43x / (x - 1).We can rewrite this function to better understand its behavior.Let me perform polynomial long division or manipulate it algebraically.Let me write y = 43x / (x - 1).Let me express this as:y = 43x / (x - 1) = 43(x - 1 + 1) / (x - 1) = 43[(x - 1)/(x - 1) + 1/(x - 1)] = 43[1 + 1/(x - 1)] = 43 + 43/(x - 1).So, y = 43 + 43/(x - 1).This form shows that y is a linear transformation of 1/(x - 1), shifted up by 43.Now, let's analyze the range.The term 43/(x - 1) can take any real value except 0, because as x approaches 1 from above, 43/(x - 1) approaches +∞, and as x approaches 1 from below, it approaches -∞. Also, as x approaches ±∞, 43/(x - 1) approaches 0.Therefore, y = 43 + 43/(x - 1) can take any real value except 43, because 43/(x - 1) can never be 0, so y can never be 43.Hence, the range of y is all real numbers except 43.So, in set notation, the range is {y | y ≠ 43}.Therefore, the range of the function y = (43x)/(x - 1) is all real numbers except 43."},{"question":"For every integer  n  not equal to  1  or  -1 , define  S(n)  as the smallest integer greater than  1  that divides  n .

Let me try to understand it step by step.First, the problem defines a function S(n) for every integer n not equal to 1 or -1. S(n) is the smallest integer greater than 1 that divides n. So, for example, if n is a prime number, S(n) would be n itself because primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves. For composite numbers, S(n) would be the smallest prime factor of n. They also mention that S(0) is 2, which makes sense because 0 is divisible by every integer, so the smallest one greater than 1 is 2. Additionally, S(1) and S(-1) are both defined as 1, which is consistent because 1 and -1 don't have any divisors other than themselves.Now, the problem introduces a non-constant polynomial f with integer coefficients. The key condition given is that for every positive integer n, S(f(n)) ≤ S(n). The goal is to prove that f(0) = 0.Alright, so let's unpack this. A non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients means that the polynomial has a degree of at least 1, and all its coefficients are integers. For example, f(x) could be something like 2x + 3 or x^2 - 5x + 7. The important thing is that when we plug in any integer n into f, we get another integer, and the smallest prime divisor of f(n) is less than or equal to the smallest prime divisor of n.My first thought is to consider what S(n) represents. It's the smallest prime factor of n. So, if n is a prime number, S(n) is n. If n is composite, S(n) is the smallest prime that divides n. For n=0, it's 2, and for n=1 or -1, it's 1.Given that S(f(n)) ≤ S(n) for all positive integers n, this seems to impose a strong condition on the polynomial f. It's saying that whatever f does to n, the smallest prime factor of the result can't be larger than the smallest prime factor of n. So, if n is prime, f(n) must either be 1, -1, or a composite number whose smallest prime factor is less than or equal to n. But since f is a polynomial, it can't just randomly produce 1 or -1 for all primes; it has to follow some structure.Let me think about specific cases. Suppose n is a prime number p. Then S(n) = p. So, S(f(p)) ≤ p. That means f(p) must either be 1, -1, or a composite number with a prime factor ≤ p. But f(p) is an integer, and since f is a non-constant polynomial, f(p) can't just be 1 or -1 for all primes p because that would make f a constant polynomial, which contradicts the given that it's non-constant.Therefore, for infinitely many primes p, f(p) must be composite with a prime factor ≤ p. Hmm, that's interesting. So, f(p) is composite and has a prime factor that's not larger than p. But since p is prime, the only prime factors f(p) can have are primes less than or equal to p.Wait, but if f is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then f(p) modulo p can be evaluated using Fermat's little theorem or some properties of polynomials modulo primes. Maybe that can help.Let me recall that if f(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then for any integer a and prime p, f(a) ≡ f(a mod p) mod p. So, if I take p such that p doesn't divide f(0), then f(0) mod p is non-zero. But I'm not sure yet how this connects.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the behavior of f at n=0. The problem is asking to prove that f(0)=0. So, maybe I can assume that f(0) is not zero and reach a contradiction.Suppose f(0) ≠ 0. Then f(0) is some integer, say c. So, f(x) = c + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_k x^k. Since f is non-constant, k ≥ 1.Now, let's consider n = p, a prime number. Then, f(p) = c + a_1 p + a_2 p^2 + ... + a_k p^k. So, f(p) ≡ c mod p, because all the other terms have p as a factor. Therefore, f(p) ≡ c mod p.If c ≠ 0, then f(p) ≡ c mod p, which means that p divides f(p) - c. So, if c ≠ 0, then f(p) is congruent to c modulo p, meaning that f(p) is not divisible by p unless c ≡ 0 mod p.But wait, if c ≠ 0, then for primes p that do not divide c, f(p) ≡ c mod p ≠ 0, so p does not divide f(p). Therefore, S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is at least 2. But S(p) is p, so S(f(p)) ≤ p. So, as long as f(p) is not 1 or -1, which it can't be for all p because f is non-constant, then S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p.But if c ≠ 0, then for primes p not dividing c, f(p) is not divisible by p, so S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p). But f(p) could be composite or prime. If f(p) is prime, then S(f(p)) = f(p), which would have to be ≤ p. But f(p) is a prime number, so f(p) ≤ p. But f(p) is equal to c + a_1 p + ... + a_k p^k, which for large p would be much larger than p, unless the coefficients are zero, which they aren't because it's non-constant.Wait, that seems like a contradiction. If f is a non-constant polynomial, then as p grows, f(p) will grow without bound. So, for sufficiently large primes p, f(p) will be larger than p, and if f(p) is prime, then S(f(p)) = f(p) > p, which would violate the condition S(f(p)) ≤ S(p) = p.Therefore, for sufficiently large primes p, f(p) cannot be prime. It must be composite, and its smallest prime factor must be ≤ p. But since f(p) is congruent to c mod p, and if c ≠ 0, then f(p) is not divisible by p, so the smallest prime factor of f(p) must be less than p.But if c ≠ 0, then for primes p not dividing c, f(p) is congruent to c mod p, so f(p) is not divisible by p. Therefore, the smallest prime factor of f(p) is some prime less than p. But how does that help us?Wait, maybe if c ≠ 0, we can choose primes p such that p divides c. Let's say c has some prime factors. Let’s denote the prime factors of c as p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Then, for primes p not dividing c, f(p) is not divisible by p, so S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p. But for primes p dividing c, f(p) is divisible by p, so S(f(p)) ≤ p.But if c ≠ 0, then c has only finitely many prime factors. So, for primes p not dividing c, f(p) is not divisible by p, so S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p. But if c ≠ 0, then f(p) is congruent to c mod p, so f(p) is not divisible by p, so S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p). But since f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, and p is a prime, maybe we can find a prime p such that f(p) is prime, which would cause S(f(p)) = f(p) > p, violating the condition.But earlier, I thought that for large p, f(p) would be larger than p, so if f(p) is prime, S(f(p)) = f(p) > p, which would violate S(f(p)) ≤ S(p) = p. Therefore, to prevent this, f(p) must not be prime for large p. So, f(p) must be composite for all sufficiently large p, and its smallest prime factor must be ≤ p.But how can we ensure that? It seems difficult unless f(p) is constructed in a way that it's always divisible by some small prime.Wait, maybe if f(0) = 0, then f(x) is divisible by x, so f(n) is divisible by n for all n. Then, S(f(n)) would be the smallest prime factor of f(n), which is ≤ the smallest prime factor of n, which is S(n). So, that would satisfy the condition S(f(n)) ≤ S(n). But the problem is asking to prove that f(0) = 0, not assuming it.So, perhaps f(0) must be 0 to satisfy the condition. Let me think about that.Suppose f(0) ≠ 0. Then, f(0) is some integer c ≠ 0. Let's consider n = c. Then, S(f(c)) ≤ S(c). But f(c) = c + a_1 c + a_2 c^2 + ... + a_k c^k. So, f(c) is some integer. If c ≠ 0, then S(f(c)) is the smallest prime factor of f(c), which must be ≤ S(c). But S(c) is the smallest prime factor of c. So, if c has a prime factor p, then S(c) = p. Therefore, S(f(c)) must be ≤ p.But f(c) is equal to c times (1 + a_1 + a_2 c + ... + a_k c^{k-1}). So, f(c) is divisible by c. Therefore, f(c) is divisible by all prime factors of c. So, S(f(c)) is the smallest prime factor of f(c), which is the same as the smallest prime factor of c, because f(c) is a multiple of c. Therefore, S(f(c)) = S(c). So, in this case, S(f(c)) = S(c), which satisfies the condition S(f(c)) ≤ S(c).Hmm, so that doesn't give a contradiction. Maybe I need a different approach.Let me think about the behavior of f(n) modulo small primes. Suppose f(0) ≠ 0, so f(0) = c ≠ 0. Let p be a prime that does not divide c. Then, f(p) ≡ c mod p, so f(p) is not divisible by p. Therefore, S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p.But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. If f(p) is composite, then its smallest prime factor is ≤ p. If f(p) is prime, then S(f(p)) = f(p), which would have to be ≤ p, but f(p) is a prime number, so f(p) ≤ p. But f(p) is equal to c + a_1 p + a_2 p^2 + ... + a_k p^k. For large p, this would be much larger than p, so f(p) cannot be prime for large p. Therefore, f(p) must be composite for sufficiently large primes p.But how does this help us? Maybe if we consider that f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than or equal to S(n) for all n. If f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is not divisible by n for all n, but for n=0, f(0) is c, which is not zero.Wait, but n=0 is not considered in the condition because the problem states \\"for every positive integer n\\". So, n=0 is excluded. Therefore, f(0) could be non-zero, but we need to show that it must be zero.Let me think about another angle. Suppose f(0) ≠ 0. Then, f(0) is some integer c ≠ 0. Let me consider n = p, a prime number. As before, f(p) ≡ c mod p. If c ≠ 0, then f(p) is not divisible by p, so S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p.But if c ≠ 0, then for primes p not dividing c, f(p) is not divisible by p, so S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p). But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. If f(p) is composite, then its smallest prime factor is ≤ p. If f(p) is prime, then S(f(p)) = f(p), which would have to be ≤ p, but f(p) is a prime number, so f(p) ≤ p. But for large p, f(p) is much larger than p, so f(p) cannot be prime for large p. Therefore, f(p) must be composite for sufficiently large primes p.But how does this help us? Maybe if we consider that f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than or equal to S(n) for all n. If f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is not divisible by n for all n, but for n=0, f(0) is c, which is not zero.Wait, but n=0 is not considered in the condition because the problem states \\"for every positive integer n\\". So, n=0 is excluded. Therefore, f(0) could be non-zero, but we need to show that it must be zero.Let me think about the behavior of f(n) modulo small primes. Suppose f(0) ≠ 0, so f(0) = c ≠ 0. Let p be a prime that does not divide c. Then, f(p) ≡ c mod p, so f(p) is not divisible by p. Therefore, S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p.But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. If f(p) is composite, then its smallest prime factor is ≤ p. If f(p) is prime, then S(f(p)) = f(p), which would have to be ≤ p, but f(p) is a prime number, so f(p) ≤ p. But for large p, f(p) is much larger than p, so f(p) cannot be prime for large p. Therefore, f(p) must be composite for sufficiently large primes p.But how does this help us? Maybe if we consider that f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than or equal to S(n) for all n. If f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is not divisible by n for all n, but for n=0, f(0) is c, which is not zero.Wait, but n=0 is not considered in the condition because the problem states \\"for every positive integer n\\". So, n=0 is excluded. Therefore, f(0) could be non-zero, but we need to show that it must be zero.Let me try a different approach. Suppose f(0) ≠ 0. Then, f(0) = c ≠ 0. Let's consider n = c. Then, f(c) = c + a_1 c + a_2 c^2 + ... + a_k c^k. So, f(c) is divisible by c, which means that S(f(c)) is the smallest prime factor of c. But S(c) is also the smallest prime factor of c. Therefore, S(f(c)) = S(c), which satisfies the condition S(f(c)) ≤ S(c).But this doesn't give a contradiction. Maybe I need to consider another value of n.Let me consider n = 1. Then, S(1) = 1. So, S(f(1)) ≤ 1. But S(f(1)) is defined as the smallest integer greater than 1 that divides f(1). If f(1) is 1 or -1, then S(f(1)) = 1. Otherwise, S(f(1)) would be at least 2. But the condition requires S(f(1)) ≤ 1, which means that f(1) must be 1 or -1.So, f(1) must be 1 or -1. Similarly, let's consider n = -1. S(-1) = 1, so S(f(-1)) ≤ 1, which means f(-1) must be 1 or -1.Therefore, f(1) and f(-1) are both 1 or -1. That's a useful piece of information.Now, let's consider n = 2. S(2) = 2. So, S(f(2)) ≤ 2. That means f(2) must be even, because if f(2) is odd, then S(f(2)) would be at least 2, but if f(2) is even, S(f(2)) is 2. So, f(2) must be even.Similarly, for n = 3, S(3) = 3. So, S(f(3)) ≤ 3. That means f(3) must be divisible by 2 or 3. If f(3) is even, then S(f(3)) = 2 ≤ 3. If f(3) is odd, then it must be divisible by 3, so S(f(3)) = 3.But since f is a polynomial with integer coefficients, the parity of f(n) depends on the parity of the coefficients. Let's see.If f(1) is 1 or -1, and f(-1) is 1 or -1, then let's consider f(1) and f(-1):f(1) = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_kf(-1) = a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - ... + (-1)^k a_kSince both f(1) and f(-1) are 1 or -1, their sum and difference will be even or odd accordingly.But maybe this is getting too detailed. Let me think about the behavior of f(n) modulo 2.If f(2) is even, then f(2) ≡ 0 mod 2. Since f has integer coefficients, f(2) ≡ f(0) mod 2. Therefore, f(0) must be even. So, f(0) is even.Similarly, let's consider n = 3. If f(3) is divisible by 2 or 3. If f(3) is even, then f(3) ≡ 0 mod 2, which implies f(0) ≡ 0 mod 2, which we already know. If f(3) is odd, then it must be divisible by 3, so f(3) ≡ 0 mod 3. But f(3) ≡ f(0) mod 3, so f(0) ≡ 0 mod 3.Wait, so if f(3) is odd, then f(0) must be divisible by 3. But if f(0) is divisible by 3, then f(3) ≡ 0 mod 3, so f(3) is divisible by 3, which is fine because S(f(3)) ≤ 3.But if f(3) is even, then f(0) is even, which we already have. So, f(0) must be divisible by 2 and possibly 3.Similarly, let's consider n = 4. S(4) = 2. So, S(f(4)) ≤ 2, which means f(4) must be even. Therefore, f(4) ≡ 0 mod 2, which implies f(0) ≡ 0 mod 2, which we already know.Wait, but f(4) is even, so f(4) is divisible by 2. But f(4) is also equal to f(0) + a_1*4 + a_2*16 + ... + a_k*4^k. Since f(0) is even, and all other terms are multiples of 4, which are even, f(4) is even, which is consistent.But how does this help us? Maybe if we consider higher primes.Let me consider n = p, a prime number greater than 2. Then, S(p) = p. So, S(f(p)) ≤ p. That means f(p) must be divisible by some prime ≤ p.But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. If f(p) is divisible by p, then S(f(p)) ≤ p, which is fine. If f(p) is not divisible by p, then f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p.But f(p) ≡ f(0) mod p. So, if f(0) is not divisible by p, then f(p) ≡ f(0) mod p ≠ 0, so p does not divide f(p). Therefore, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p.But if f(0) is divisible by all primes, then f(0) must be zero because the only integer divisible by all primes is zero. Wait, that's a key point.So, suppose f(0) is not zero. Then, f(0) is some integer c ≠ 0. Let p be a prime that does not divide c. Then, f(p) ≡ c mod p ≠ 0, so p does not divide f(p). Therefore, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p.But for each prime p, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p. However, if c is not zero, then c has only finitely many prime factors. Let’s denote the prime factors of c as p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Then, for primes p > p_m, p does not divide c, so f(p) ≡ c mod p ≠ 0, meaning p does not divide f(p). Therefore, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p.But for each prime p, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p. However, if we consider all primes p, the set of primes less than p is infinite, but f(p) is a polynomial, so it can't be divisible by infinitely many primes unless f(p) is zero, which it isn't because f is non-constant.Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me try again.If f(0) ≠ 0, then f(0) has only finitely many prime factors. Let’s say the prime factors are p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Now, consider a prime p > p_m. Then, p does not divide f(0), so f(p) ≡ f(0) mod p ≠ 0. Therefore, p does not divide f(p). So, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p. But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. So, f(p) is an integer, and if it's composite, it has prime factors.But if f(p) is composite, its prime factors are all ≤ p. But since p does not divide f(p), the prime factors must be ≤ p-1. However, if we consider that for each prime p, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p, but f(p) is a polynomial, which can't have infinitely many prime factors unless it's zero.Wait, but f(p) is not necessarily prime; it's just an integer. So, for each p, f(p) is composite with prime factors ≤ p. But how does this relate to f(0)?I think the key is that if f(0) is not zero, then f(0) has only finitely many prime factors. Therefore, for primes p larger than the largest prime factor of f(0), f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p. But since f(p) is a polynomial, it's possible that f(p) is divisible by some fixed set of primes, but for infinitely many p, this would require f(p) to be divisible by infinitely many primes, which is impossible unless f(p) is zero, which it isn't.Wait, that might be the way to go. Let me formalize this.Suppose f(0) ≠ 0. Let’s denote f(0) = c, where c is a non-zero integer. Let’s let p_1, p_2, ..., p_m be the prime factors of c. Now, consider a prime p > p_m. Since p does not divide c, f(p) ≡ c mod p ≠ 0, so p does not divide f(p). Therefore, f(p) must be divisible by some prime q < p.But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. So, f(p) is an integer, and if it's composite, it has prime factors. However, for each p, f(p) must be divisible by some prime q < p. But since p can be arbitrarily large, the primes q must also be arbitrarily large, which is impossible because there are only finitely many primes less than any given p.Wait, no, actually, for each p, q can be any prime less than p, but as p increases, q can also increase. However, f(p) is a polynomial, so its prime factors can't grow faster than the polynomial itself. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is congruent to f(0) modulo n for all n. So, f(n) ≡ c mod n. Therefore, if n does not divide c, then f(n) ≡ c mod n ≠ 0, so n does not divide f(n). Therefore, S(f(n)) is the smallest prime factor of f(n), which must be ≤ n.But if n is prime, then S(n) = n, so S(f(n)) ≤ n. If f(n) is composite, then its smallest prime factor is ≤ n. If f(n) is prime, then S(f(n)) = f(n) ≤ n, which would require f(n) ≤ n, but f(n) is a polynomial of degree ≥1, so for large n, f(n) > n, which would make f(n) composite because it's larger than n and not prime.Wait, but if f(n) is composite, then its smallest prime factor is ≤ n. But how does this relate to f(0)?I think the key is that if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is congruent to f(0) mod n, so for n not dividing f(0), f(n) is not divisible by n. Therefore, S(f(n)) is the smallest prime factor of f(n), which is ≤ n. But if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is not divisible by n for infinitely many n, which might cause problems.Wait, but the condition is S(f(n)) ≤ S(n). If n is prime, S(n) = n, so S(f(n)) ≤ n. If f(n) is composite, its smallest prime factor is ≤ n. If f(n) is prime, then f(n) ≤ n, which is impossible for large n because f(n) is a polynomial of degree ≥1.Therefore, for large primes n, f(n) must be composite, and its smallest prime factor must be ≤ n. But since f(n) is congruent to f(0) mod n, and if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is not divisible by n, so f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than n.But if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(0) has only finitely many prime factors. Let’s say the prime factors are p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Then, for primes n > p_m, f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than n, but not by n itself. However, since f(n) is a polynomial, it can't be divisible by infinitely many primes unless it's zero, which it isn't.Wait, but f(n) is not necessarily divisible by the same prime for all n. It just needs to be divisible by some prime ≤ n for each n. But if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is congruent to f(0) mod n, so for n not dividing f(0), f(n) is not divisible by n. Therefore, f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than n.But if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(0) has only finitely many prime factors. Let’s say the prime factors are p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Then, for primes n > p_m, f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than n, but not necessarily the same prime for all n.However, if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is congruent to f(0) mod n, so f(n) ≡ c mod n. Therefore, f(n) is not divisible by n, but it must be divisible by some prime less than n. But if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(n) is congruent to c mod n, which is non-zero, so f(n) is not divisible by n.But how does this lead to a contradiction? Maybe if we consider that f(n) must be divisible by some prime less than n for all n, but f(n) is a polynomial, which can't have infinitely many prime factors unless it's zero.Wait, but f(n) is not necessarily divisible by the same prime for all n. It just needs to be divisible by some prime ≤ n for each n. So, for each n, there exists a prime q_n ≤ n such that q_n divides f(n). But since f is a polynomial, the set of primes q_n must be finite or something?No, actually, the set of primes q_n can be infinite, but f(n) is a polynomial, so it can't have infinitely many prime factors unless it's zero. Wait, but f(n) is not zero, it's a non-constant polynomial.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the behavior of f(n) modulo small primes.Suppose f(0) ≠ 0. Let’s denote f(0) = c ≠ 0. Let p be a prime that does not divide c. Then, f(p) ≡ c mod p ≠ 0, so p does not divide f(p). Therefore, S(f(p)) is the smallest prime factor of f(p), which is ≤ p.But f(p) is a polynomial evaluated at p, which is a prime. If f(p) is composite, then its smallest prime factor is ≤ p. If f(p) is prime, then S(f(p)) = f(p) ≤ p, which is impossible for large p because f(p) is a polynomial of degree ≥1, so f(p) > p for large p.Therefore, for large primes p, f(p) must be composite, and its smallest prime factor must be ≤ p. But since f(p) is congruent to c mod p, and p does not divide c, f(p) is not divisible by p. Therefore, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p.But if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(0) has only finitely many prime factors. Let’s say the prime factors are p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Then, for primes p > p_m, f(p) must be divisible by some prime less than p, but not by p itself.However, if f(p) is divisible by some prime q < p, then q must divide f(p). But since f is a polynomial with integer coefficients, f(p) ≡ f(0) mod q. Therefore, f(0) ≡ f(p) mod q. Since q divides f(p), f(0) ≡ 0 mod q. Therefore, q divides f(0).But f(0) has only finitely many prime factors, say p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. Therefore, for primes p > p_m, f(p) must be divisible by one of these primes p_i. But f(p) is congruent to c mod p_i, so f(p) ≡ c mod p_i. Since p_i divides f(0) = c, we have c ≡ 0 mod p_i. Therefore, f(p) ≡ 0 mod p_i, which is consistent because p_i divides f(p).But wait, this means that for primes p > p_m, f(p) must be divisible by one of the primes p_i. But since p_i are fixed, and p can be arbitrarily large, this would mean that f(p) is divisible by one of the fixed primes p_i for infinitely many p. But f(p) is a polynomial, so it can't be divisible by the same prime infinitely often unless it's zero, which it isn't.Wait, no, actually, f(p) can be divisible by different primes p_i for different p. But since p_i are fixed, and p can be arbitrarily large, this would mean that f(p) is divisible by one of the fixed primes p_i for infinitely many p. But f(p) is a polynomial, so if it's divisible by a fixed prime q for infinitely many p, then q must divide all coefficients of f, which would make f a constant polynomial, which contradicts the fact that f is non-constant.Wait, that seems like a contradiction. Let me formalize this.Suppose f(0) ≠ 0, so f(0) = c ≠ 0, and let p_1, p_2, ..., p_m be the prime factors of c. For any prime p > p_m, f(p) must be divisible by one of the p_i. Therefore, for each p > p_m, there exists some i such that p_i divides f(p). But f(p) is a polynomial, so if p_i divides f(p) for infinitely many p, then p_i divides all coefficients of f, which would make f a constant polynomial, contradicting the fact that f is non-constant.Therefore, our assumption that f(0) ≠ 0 leads to a contradiction. Hence, f(0) must be zero.So, putting it all together, if f(0) ≠ 0, then f(p) must be divisible by one of the prime factors of f(0) for infinitely many primes p, which would imply that f is a constant polynomial, contradicting the given that f is non-constant. Therefore, f(0) must be zero."},{"question":"According to the corresponding values in the table below, the range of a solution x for the quadratic equation ax^{2}+bx+c=0 is ( ).| x   | 0   | 0.5   | 1   | 1.5   | 2   ||-------|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------|| ax^{2}+bx+c | -15 | -8.75 | -2 | 5.25 | 13  |A: 0 lt x lt 0.5B: 0.5 lt x lt 1C: 1 lt x lt 1.5D: 1.5 lt x lt 2","answer":"Alright, so I have this quadratic equation, right? It's in the form ax² + bx + c = 0. And I've been given a table that shows the values of this quadratic expression at different points of x. The x-values are 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2, and the corresponding values of ax² + bx + c are -15, -8.75, -2, 5.25, and 13 respectively.Okay, so I need to figure out the range of a solution x for this quadratic equation. The options are:A: 0 < x < 0.5B: 0.5 < x < 1C: 1 < x < 1.5D: 1.5 < x < 2Hmm, quadratic equations can have two solutions, right? But since the question is asking for the range of a solution, I think it's referring to one of the solutions. Maybe the positive one? Or perhaps it's implying that there's only one solution in that range. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.First, let's recall that the solutions to a quadratic equation are the x-values where the quadratic expression equals zero. So, I'm looking for the x where ax² + bx + c = 0.Looking at the table, at x=0, the value is -15. That's negative. At x=0.5, it's -8.75, still negative. At x=1, it's -2, still negative but getting closer to zero. At x=1.5, it's 5.25, which is positive. And at x=2, it's 13, also positive.So, between x=1 and x=1.5, the quadratic expression goes from -2 to 5.25. That means it crosses zero somewhere in that interval. That suggests that one of the solutions is between 1 and 1.5.Similarly, looking at the other intervals:From x=0 to x=0.5: The expression goes from -15 to -8.75. Both negative, so no crossing of zero here.From x=0.5 to x=1: The expression goes from -8.75 to -2. Still negative, so no zero crossing here either.From x=1.5 to x=2: The expression goes from 5.25 to 13. Both positive, so no zero crossing here.Therefore, the only interval where the expression crosses zero is between x=1 and x=1.5. So, the solution must lie in that interval.Wait, but quadratic equations can have two solutions. So, is there another solution somewhere else?Well, looking at the table, at x=0, it's -15, and as x increases, it becomes less negative until x=1, where it's -2, then becomes positive at x=1.5. So, it seems like the expression is increasing throughout the interval from x=0 to x=2.If the quadratic is increasing throughout, that would mean it only crosses zero once, right? But quadratics usually have two solutions unless it's a perfect square or something.Wait, maybe the quadratic is opening upwards, and it only crosses the x-axis once between x=1 and x=1.5, and the other solution is somewhere else.But looking at the table, at x=0, it's -15, and as x increases, it's getting less negative, then positive. So, it's increasing throughout. That suggests that there's only one real solution, which is between x=1 and x=1.5.But wait, quadratics have two solutions unless the discriminant is zero, which would mean a repeated root. But in this case, since the expression goes from negative to positive, it's crossing the x-axis once, implying one real solution. But that contradicts the general behavior of quadratics, which usually have two solutions unless it's a perfect square.Hmm, maybe I need to check if the quadratic is indeed opening upwards or downwards.Looking at the values, at x=0, it's -15, and as x increases, the value increases to -8.75, then to -2, then to 5.25, and finally to 13. So, the quadratic is increasing as x increases, which suggests that it's opening upwards. Because if it were opening downwards, the expression would eventually decrease after reaching a maximum.So, if it's opening upwards, and it crosses the x-axis once between x=1 and x=1.5, then the other solution must be somewhere else. But looking at the table, the expression is negative at x=0, 0.5, and 1, and positive at x=1.5 and 2. So, it only crosses zero once in the given interval.Wait, but quadratics should have two solutions. Maybe the other solution is outside the given x-values. For example, maybe it's less than 0 or greater than 2.But the question is asking for the range of a solution x, so perhaps it's referring to the solution within the given x-values, which is between 1 and 1.5.Alternatively, maybe the quadratic only has one real solution in that interval, and the other solution is complex. But that would mean the discriminant is negative, which contradicts the fact that the expression crosses zero.Wait, no, if the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions; if it's zero, one real solution; if it's negative, two complex solutions.In this case, since the expression crosses zero, the discriminant must be positive, meaning two real solutions.But according to the table, the expression is negative at x=0, 0.5, 1, and positive at x=1.5, 2. So, it only crosses zero once between x=1 and x=1.5. That suggests that one solution is between 1 and 1.5, and the other solution is somewhere else.But where? If the quadratic is opening upwards, and it's negative at x=0, it must have crossed zero somewhere before x=0 as well, right? Because if it's opening upwards, it would come from negative infinity, cross the x-axis at some point, reach a minimum, and then go back up.Wait, but at x=0, it's -15, and as x increases, it's increasing. So, it's possible that the other solution is less than 0.But the question is asking for the range of a solution x, and the options are all between 0 and 2. So, maybe they're only considering the positive solution.Alternatively, maybe the quadratic is opening downwards, but that would mean the expression would decrease after reaching a maximum.Wait, let's think about the behavior of the quadratic.If a quadratic opens upwards, it has a minimum point, and if it opens downwards, it has a maximum point.Given that the expression is increasing from x=0 to x=2, it suggests that the vertex is to the left of x=0, meaning the quadratic is opening upwards, and the minimum point is at some x < 0.Therefore, the quadratic crosses the x-axis once between x=1 and x=1.5, and the other solution is less than 0.But since the question is asking for the range of a solution x, and the options are all between 0 and 2, I think they're referring to the positive solution, which is between 1 and 1.5.Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: 1 < x < 1.5.But just to be thorough, let's see if we can approximate the solution.At x=1, the expression is -2.At x=1.5, it's 5.25.So, the change in x is 0.5, and the change in the expression is 5.25 - (-2) = 7.25.We can approximate the root using linear interpolation.The root is where the expression equals zero.From x=1 to x=1.5, the expression increases by 7.25 over an interval of 0.5.So, the fraction needed to reach zero from x=1 is 2 / 7.25.So, the root is approximately at x = 1 + (2 / 7.25) * 0.5.Wait, no, let's think again.At x=1, the expression is -2.We need to find how much we need to increase x to make the expression zero.The total increase needed is 2 units.The rate of increase is 7.25 over 0.5 units of x.So, the required increase in x is (2 / 7.25) * 0.5.Wait, that might not be the right way.Alternatively, the change in expression per unit x is 7.25 / 0.5 = 14.5.So, to increase the expression by 2 units, we need to increase x by 2 / 14.5 ≈ 0.1379.So, the root is approximately at x = 1 + 0.1379 ≈ 1.1379.So, approximately 1.14.That's between 1 and 1.5, so it's in the interval C.Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1 < x < 1.5."},{"question":"What is the largest multiple of 11 less than 100?","answer":"To find the largest multiple of 11 less than 100, I start by dividing 100 by 11 to determine how many times 11 fits into 100.100 divided by 11 equals 9 with a remainder of 1.Next, I multiply 11 by 9 to find the largest multiple of 11 that is still less than 100.11 multiplied by 9 equals 99.Therefore, the largest multiple of 11 less than 100 is 99."},{"question":"There are 95 students in both first and second year classes.
